en.15.139.461.2009.8.11,EU to tighten sanctions after Suu Kyi conviction,"STOCKHOLM, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union said it would toughen its sanctions against Myanmar after Tuesday's latest conviction of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. France and Britain called for global arms and economic embargoes. Suu Kyi was sentenced on Tuesday to a further 18 months in detention after an American man breached the terms of her house arrest by swimming uninvited to her lakeside home in May. Sweden said the EU would ""further reinforce its restrictive measures targeting the regime of Burma/Myanmar, including its economic interests"", but gave no further details. ""The proceedings against Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, on charges that were brought 20 years after she was first wrongfully arrested, have been in breach of national and international law,"" it said, demanding her immediate and unconditional release. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the verdict was a political step by the military rulers of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, to prevent Suu Kyi taking part in elections next year. ""The Burmese authorities have shown with this iniquitous ruling their decision to ignore pressing messages from the international community,"" Sarkozy's office said in a statement. ""The president asks the European Union to react rapidly by adopting new sanctions against the Burmese regime, which should particularly target the resources that it profits directly from -- wood and ruby mining."" French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said there should be a global embargo on arms sales to Myanmar and a ""robust mechanism"" to keep track of wood and ruby exports. The EU has long prohibited any transfer of arms from the bloc to Myanmar, or equipment that might be used for internal repression. After a crackdown on pro-democracy protests led by Buddhist monks in Sept. 2007, it targeted 1,207 Myanmar firms with measures including visa bans and asset freezes. It also maintains a visa ban and asset freezes on members of the military government and its backers. Brown said in a statement he was ""saddened and angry"" at the ""monstrous"" verdict. ""The facade of (Suu Kyi's) prosecution is made more monstrous because its real objective is to sever her bond with the people for whom she is a beacon of hope and resistance,"" he said, calling for the U.N. Security Council to impose a worldwide ban on arms sales to Myanmar."
en.15.139.169.2009.8.11,American in Suu Kyi case back in Myanmar jail,"YANGON, Aug 11(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An American at the center of Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's trial on security charges has been moved back to prison from hospital, raising the chances of their trial resuming on Tuesday as planned. John Yettaw, whose bizarre swim to Suu Kyi's lakeside home in May breached the terms of her house arrest, was moved back to his prison cell shortly before midnight on Monday, a hospital source said. He had been taken to hospital on August 3 after falling ill in prison. A verdict in the trial had been expected on August 4 but the judge adjourned the case until Tuesday, August 11. Yettaw, 54, from Missouri, is on trial alongside Suu Kyi and two of her housemaids. He is charged with immigration offences and for swimming in a non-swimming area. Suu Kyi, long-time leader of the pro-democracy movement in army-ruled Myanmar, has spent 14 of the past 20 years in detention of one form or another. The prosecution says Yettaw's two-day stay at Suu Kyi's home in May, even though he was uninvited, meant she violated an internal security law. She faces up to five years more in detention if found guilty. Yettaw, a Mormon, has told the court God sent him to warn Suu Kyi she would be assassinated by ""terrorists."" Critics say the trial has been trumped up by the military government as a way of keeping Suu Kyi out of circulation in the run-up to and during a general election planned for 2"
en.15.139.408.2009.8.10,"HC asks Coco, lawyers to explain forgery allegations","Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday asked Arafat Rahman Coco, son of opposition leader Khaleda Zia, and his lawyers to explain the forgery allegations against them after the government accused them last week of filing a petition with the court through fake power of attorney. Coco's petition to the High Court, filed on Aug 2, challenges a money laundering case against him filed by the Anticorruption Commission in March this year. The government filed a counter petition with the court three days later, on Aug 5, accusing Coco and his lawyers of producing a fake power of attorney in filing the petition. The government sought permission to file criminal cases against those who were involved with adopting illegal means in filing Coco's petition. The bench of justices Syed Refat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury on Monday asked Coco, his two lawyers, power of attorney Taherul Islam Touhid and barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan to explain within three weeks why forgery charges should not be investigated. The court also stayed the hearing on Coco's petition. The same High Court bench is proceeding separately on Coco's petition that was filed on Aug 2 by Taherul Islam Touhid claiming power of attorney on behalf of Coco who is currently residing in Thailand. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told the court on Aug 5 that the proper official of the Bangladesh embassy in Thailand had not certified the power of attorney claimed by Touhid in the hearing of Coco's petition. Alam also said the power of attorney showed a false address. He accused Coco's lawyer Mahbub Uddin Khokon of falsely attesting his client's signature on the alleged power of attorney. He said ""it was clear"" Coco did not authorise Touhid's signature and that the power of attorney was ""a forged and fabricated document"". Alam said it needs investigating and criminal charges should be filed. The ACC case against Coco, filed under the Money Laundering Act 2009, accuses him of laundering funds to Singapore worth nearly US $932,000 and Singapore $2.8 million. It further accuses him of earning the money illegally from foreign companies in exchange for awarding government contracts between 2004 and 2007, when his mother was prime minister. Coco is receiving treatment at Bangkok on parole granted on July 19 last year after he fell sick in jail. Stay upheld on illegal wealth case In a separate development on Monday, the Appellate Division rejected a petition by the Anticorruption Commission seeking to appeal against a High Court stay order on proceedings of an illegal wealth case against Coco. b"

en.15.139.434.2009.8.11,W.House says Obama strategy will win Afghan war,"GUADALAJARA, Mexico, Tue Aug 11,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The White House said on Monday that President Barack Obama has a ""winning"" strategy in Afghanistan and enough forces on the ground to achieve US goals despite advances by the Taliban. The assurances came as the top US commander in Afghanistan warned that the Taliban were gaining momentum, while gunmen and bombers stormed government buildings near Kabul just 10 days before a presidential election, White House spokesman Bill Burton said that Obama had authorized 21,000 new troops for Afghanistan since taking office in January and not all of these were on the ground yet. ""The president's strategy hasn't fully been implemented just yet. But we do believe that with the strategy that we have, with assets that we're putting on the ground, that we are going to be able to achieve the goals that we're trying to achieve,"" Burton told reporters on Obama's Air Force One flight back to Washington from a North American summit in Mexico. U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal, who will soon present an assessment of the Afghan war, said in a newspaper interview published on Monday that the resurgent Taliban have forced a change of tactics on foreign forces and that record casualty figures would remain high for some months. ""It's a very aggressive enemy right now,"" McChrystal, who is also the NATO commander in Afghanistan, told The Wall Street Journal (online.wsj.com/). ""We've got to stop their momentum, stop their initiative. It's hard work."" The White House said McChrystal was preparing a thorough assessment of the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and US officials will see what his review turns up. ""Obviously the president is in close contact with his commanders on the ground, but ... thinks that the strategy that he put in place is a winning one,"" Burton said. Violence across Afghanistan this year had already reached its worst levels since the Taliban were ousted by US-led Afghan forces in 2001 and escalated dramatically after major offensives were launched in southern Helmand province in July. Three Afghan police and two civilians were killed in a strike by Taliban gunmen and suicide bombers on government buildings near Kabul on Monday. Washington plans to increase the number of its troops to about 68,000 by year's end, more than double the 32,000 it had stationed in Afghanistan at the end of 2008.

en.15.139.219.2009.8.10,Snowin' in the Wind? Dylan Christmas album due,"LONDON, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bob Dylan is set to release an album of Christmas songs, including ""Here Comes Santa Claus"" and the carol ""O Little Town of Bethlehem,"" according to music websites. Rumours of the album first emerged on Isis magazine website, which is devoted to Dylan. It later reported the songs had been recorded in Jackson Browne's studio in Santa Monica, California, in May. David Hidalgo of Los Lobos, who played accordion on Dylan's chart-topping latest album ""Together Through Life,"" is one of the musicians who took part in the sessions, it said. ""It is a personal project of Dylan himself rather than an idea put forward by his record company,"" Isis said. Billboard magazine said it had confirmed the album existed. Other songs included ""Must Be Santa"" and ""I'll be Home for Christmas,"" it said. Dylan was originally of the Jewish faith and was a Born Again Christian from 1979-1981, releasing three religious-themed albums. ""At first glance it may sound bizarre, but I don't think Dylan cares much about what his detractors might make of it,"" Scott Marshall, who has written a book 'God and Bob Dylan: A Spiritual Life' told bullypulpit.com. ""He's both never renounced being Jewish or renounced his experience with Jesus some three decades ago,"" Marshall said. Dylan, now aged 68, is currently touring the United States as part of his so-called ""Never Ending Tour."" Britain's Uncut magazine meanwhile poked fun at the project, serving up Yuletide puns on Dylan songs such as ""A Hard Reindeer's A-Gonna Fall,"" ""Sleigh Lady Sleigh"" and ""Girl From The North Pole Country."
en.15.139.217.2009.8.10,`G.I. Joe' movie leads worldwide invasion,"LOS ANGELES, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A new action movie based on the ""G.I. Joe"" line of toy soldiers crushed enemy forces at the worldwide box office during the weekend, ending the three-week reign of the sixth ""Harry Potter"" fantasy. ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" sold about $100.3 million worth of tickets, distributor Paramount Pictures said on Sunday. The three-day take of $56.2 million from the United States and Canada ranks as the fourth-highest August opening ever, and comes after the $175 million effects extravaganza had been besieged by bad buzz for months. The foreign component of $44.1 million -- from 35 markets comprising 75 percent of international sales -- was led by South Korea ($5.6 million). The film opened at No. 1 in two countries not exactly favorable to American militarism, China ($4.8 million) and Russia ($4.6 million). ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" earned $31 million worldwide, taking its total to $816 million. The North American total of $274 million was bolstered by a fourth-place $8.9 million weekend. The film was released by Warner Bros. Pictures, a unit of Time Warner Inc. Besides ""G.I. Joe,"" other new entries in North America included Columbia Pictures' Meryl Streep culinary offering ""Julie & Julia"" at No. 2 with a tasty $20.1 million, and indie producer Relativity Media's horror-thriller ""A Perfect Getaway"" at No. 7 with just $5.8 million. Last weekend's North American champion, the Adam Sandler comedy ""Funny People,"" slid to No. 5 with $7.9 million, taking the 10-day total for the $75 million comedy to a disappointing $40.4 million. The film was released by Universal Pictures, a unit of General Electric Co. ""G.I. Joe"" stars Channing Tatum and Marlon Wayans as two young soldiers recruited by the international G.I. Joe military force to help save the world. It was directed by Stephen Sommers of ""The Mummy"" fame. BAD BUZZ While based on the venerable Hasbro Inc action figures, the film tips its hat to the multilateral series of dolls relaunched in the 1980s rather than the American-oriented military heroes coveted by boys in the 1960s and 1970s. (G.I. is a generic term for U.S. soldiers.) Given the wide awareness of the brand, fans were underwhelmed by a trailer that premiered in February during the Super Bowl football championship, the most-watched television event of the year in the United States. Paramount opted not to screen the movie in advance for critics, a gambit often reserved for box office clunkers. In the end, reviews were predictably bad but not as bad as those for such recent releases as ""G-Force"" and ""The Ugly Truth."" ""I think it plays to real people,"" said Don Harris, executive vice president of distribution at the Viacom Inc-owned studio. ""They check their disbelief at the door and have a good time with the movie."" Surveys indicated the film played best in the American heartland -- anywhere ""east of Beverly Hills and west of Manhattan island,"" Harris said. It also was especially popular with Hispanic and black moviegoers, he said. Overall, male moviegoers accounted for 60 percent of the audience, with an even split either side of 25 years. Based on the film's better-than-expected $22 million opening on Friday, Paramount had forecast a $60 million weekend. But Saturday sales fell more steeply than expected. Harris said he was not troubled by the decline. The record for an August opening was set in 2007 by ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" with $69.3 million, while ""Rush Hour 2"" kicked off with $67.4 million in 2001, and ""Signs"" with $60 million in 2002. All ended up with more than $220 million. Columbia Pictures offered some effective counter-programing with ""Julie & Julia,"" which pulled in older women. Streep plays Julia Child, while Amy Adams stars in a parallel story as a young woman who seeks to replicate the noted TV chef's culinary exploits. ""We're finding that men love it too,"" said Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution at the Sony Corp-owned studio. He expected the $38 million film, which was directed by Nora Ephron (""Sleepless in Seattle""), to simmer in theaters for some time"
en.15.139.230.2009.8.14,"Clijsters marches on, Williams sisters ousted","CINCINNATI, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kim Clijsters' brilliant comeback continued at the Cincinnati Open with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 win over French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova on Thursday, but the Williams sisters both fell at the third round hurdle. Second seed Serena, struggling with a virus, lost 7-5, 6-4 to Austria's Sybille Bammer while in-form Italian Flavia Pennetta ended the hopes of third seed Venus with a 7-6, 6-4 victory. Former world number one Clijsters, unseeded here in her first tournament after a two-year break, won an enthralling two-hour encounter with Russian Kuznetsova. ""Physically I've been training harder than ever,"" the Belgian told reporters. ""I didn't doubt myself (in the third set). ""I have to say I feel really good,"" added Clijsters, who gave birth to her first child during her time away from the circuit. ""I don't feel tired or drained or anything. Just a few little aches and pains from getting back into playing matches."" Retrieving everything, Clijsters broke in the second game of the match and though Kuznetsova clawed back to 4-4, she snatched the set when the sixth-seeded Russian netted a backhand. The 26-year-old looked set to win in straight sets when she led 3-0 in the second, but Kuznetsova found form to level at 3-3. HEAVY GROUNDSTROKES The Russian denied Clijsters a 5-3 lead by correctly challenging a call, then broke the Belgian in the following game and served out the set. Trading heavy groundstrokes, Kuznetsova saved a break point in the fourth game of the decider before Clijsters stepped up another level and broke twice to seal victory. Serena Williams was a shadow of the player who won Wimbledon last month and Bammer took full advantage to clinch a meeting with fifth seed Jelena Jankovic, who edged out Victoria Azarenka 7-5, 7-6. Sister Venus racked up 38 unforced errors as 14th seed Pennetta outplayed the American to clinch her fourth victory in their seven meetings. ""I'm really happy,"" Pennetta said. ""After winning last week in Los Angeles I took a lot of confidence and it showed on the court today."" Pennetta, who has now won 14 consecutive matches, constantly made Williams play one more shot than she wanted and unleashed a series of stunning passing shots. The Italian won the tiebreak 7-2 and one break in the second set was enough to give her victory. ""After a while it was obvious that she was just keeping the ball in play and waiting for me to self-destruct,"" Williams said. ""I kept pressing that red button today and it didn't work out."" Top seed Dinara Safina will be Clijsters' next opponent after she easily beat Peng Shuai of China 6-3, 6-4. Pennetta will play unseeded Daniela Hantuchova after the Slovakian beat seventh seed Vera Zvonareva of Russia 7-6, 0-6, 7-6 in a see-sawing battle lasting two hours and 50 minutes. Fourth seed Elena Dementieva of Russia will meet Caroline Wozniacki in the other quarter-f"

The bench of justice Md Abdus Salam gave the order on a petition filed by Faruque, but denied his request to overturn a decision of Proshika's governing body that sacked him as head of the NGO on May 24 this year. ""With this order, Faruque will now be able to enter the Proshika office,"" Motaher Hossain, a lawyer for the plaintiff, told bdnews24.com following the decision. Moniruzzaman Asad, counsel for recently installed Proshika chairman MA Wadud, said the current Proshika committee will carry on with its work as before. ""Faruque can enter the Proshika office, but not his men,"" said Asad. The governing body of Proshika, one of the country's largest non-government organisations, replaced founding chairman Faruque Ahmed in May following repeated allegations by employees of corruption and nepotism. On Aug 1, the ousted chairman led over 200 supporters in a demonstration to the NGO's headquarters and attempted to force their way into the building, sparking violent clashes with Proshika employees that left at least 35 injured. b"
en.15.139.75.2009.8.11,Myanmar's Suu Kyi ordered back into house detention,"YANGON Tue Aug 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A court in army-ruled Myanmar on Tuesday sentenced opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to 18 months in detention, a verdict that drew condemnation abroad and will keep her off the political stage ahead of next year's elections. The court handed down a three-year prison term for violation of an internal security law, but that was immediately halved on the orders of the military government, which said the Nobel peace laureate could serve the time in her Yangon home. ""Aung San Suu Kyi ... was found guilty of the charges and I hereby pass the sentence of three years' imprisonment,"" said the judge, drawing gasps from the courtroom. Moments after the verdict was passed, however, Myanmar's home minister, Major-General Muang Oo, stood before the court and announced that the junta had decided to commute her sentence. Muang Oo said they had taken into account the fact that Suu Kyi was the daughter of Myanmar independence hero Aung San as well as ""the need to preserve community peace and tranquility and prevent any disturbances in the road map to democracy"". The ""road map"" refers to plans laid down by the junta towards what it sees as democracy, which culminate in multi-party elections planned for next year. Muang Oo's announcement appeared to contradict the junta's repeated statements to the international community that its judiciary is independent. Critics say the case was fabricated by the military to keep the charismatic Suu Kyi out of circulation ahead of the polls. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was ""saddened and angry"" at the sentencing of the former Burma's democracy icon. ""The facade of her prosecution is made more monstrous because its real objective is to sever her bond with the people for whom she is a beacon of hope and resistance,"" he said in a statement. Australia demanded that the junta immediately release Suu Kyi along with 2,000 political prisoners. Suu Kyi has already spent 14 of the past 20 years in detention of one sort or another. The latest charges stemmed from a mysterious incident in which an American, John Yettaw, swam to Suu Kyi's lakeside home in May and stayed there uninvited for two days, which breached the terms of her house arrest and broke a security law protecting the state from ""subversive elements"". Yettaw was sentenced to seven years' hard labour in a parallel trial on three charges, including immigration offences and ""swimming in a non-swimming area"". Journalists had previously been blocked from the trial but were allowed to attend the reading of Tuesday's verdict. LENIENT? Suu Kyi's detention was described as a suspended sentence rather than house arrest, although restrictions placed on her by the junta appeared similar to those of her previous detention. Analysts said that by giving her the minimum sentence and then cutting it in half -- and allowing her to serve it at home -- the junta was hoping to depict itself to outsiders as lenient. The commuted term may have been a ploy to appease Asian allies in particular, among them China, India and Thailand, whose trade has propped up a state crippled by international sanctions. ""This is a very calibrated verdict in that everybody knows that the West is going to be unhappy,"" said Ian Holliday, a Myanmar expert from the University of Hong Kong. ""The regime is calculating that by commuting it down to one-and-a-half years and by allowing her to serve in her home rather than in prison, most Asian states will be prepared to go along with that."" The hearings were held in Yangon's Insein Prison amid tight security, with at least 2,000 security personnel in the area. State newspapers all ran the same commentary on Tuesday that implicitly warned Suu Kyi's supporters not to cause trouble and told outsiders not to meddle in Myanmar's affairs. ""The people who favour democracy do not want to see riots and protests that can harm their goal,"" said the commentary in the New Light of Myanmar and other newspapers. Yettaw was returned to prison from hospital late on Monday after suffering several seizures. His lawyer has said the American suffers from epilepsy, diabetes and heart trouble. Yettaw, a Mormon, told the court that God had sent him to warn Suu Kyi she would be assassinated by ""terroris"

en.15.139.22.2009.8.10,"Iran Guard wants former president, moderates tried","LONDON, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's Revolutionary Guard said on Sunday that two defeated presidential contenders should be tried for inciting unrest after the disputed poll, and one of the candidates said on his website detainees had been raped in jail. The June 12 election plunged Iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 Islamic revolution, exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite and set off a wave of protests that left 26 people dead. ""If (Mirhossein) Mousavi, (Mehdi) Karoubi and (former president Mohammad) Khatami are main suspects behind the soft revolution in Iran, which they are, we expect the judiciary ... to go after them, arrest them, put them on trial and punish them,"" said Yadollah Javan, a senior commander of the powerful Guard, the official IRNA news agency reported. Protests gripped Tehran and other cities after the vote, which moderates say was rigged to secure the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, though officials say it was the ""healthiest"" vote in the past 30 years. State media say at least 26 people were killed and hundreds arrested during post-election violence. The judiciary has put some of the detainees on trial to deter further dissent. Many of those arrested were held in the Kahrizak detention center in south Tehran, built to house people breaking the vice laws. At least three people died in custody there and widespread anger erupted as news spread of conditions in the jail. On Sunday Karoubi said on his website that some protesters, both male and female, had been raped while in detention, and that he had written to the head of a powerful arbitration body calling for an investigation. ""Some senior officials told me that ... really shameful issues ... Some young male detainees were raped ... also some young female detainees were raped in a way that has caused serious injuries,"" the website quoted Karoubi as saying in a letter he wrote 10 days ago to Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president. A police statement issued on Thursday confirmed that serious violations took place in Kahrizak prison. The authorities said on Sunday they had jailed the head of the detention center. ""The head of the center has been sacked and jailed. Three policemen who beat detainees have been jailed as well,"" IRNA quoted Iran's police chief Esmail Ahmadi-Moghaddam as saying. TORTURE JAIL CLOSED Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the prison's closure in July for ""lack of necessary standards"" to preserve prisoners' rights, and Ahmadi-Moghaddam said some of those held there since the post-election protests had been tortured. Moderate websites reported the death of at least three protesters in Kahrizak, including Mohsen Ruholamini, son of a top adviser to conservative defeated presidential candidate Mohsen Rezaie. Iran's top judge, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi-Shahroudi, ordered his envoys to visit all ""prisons and detention centres"" to check on conditions. Authorities say those detained in post-election unrest have been transferred to Tehran's Evin prison, where many political prisoners are held. They say some 200 protesters remain in prison, including senior pro-reform politicians, journalists, activists and lawyers. Iranian prosecutor Qorbanali Dorri-Najafabadi said all necessary legal measures would be taken against those ""who had violated the law"" in Kahrizak, Etemad-e Melli newspaper said. Leading moderates including Mousavi and former president Khatami have called for the immediate release of detainees, saying their confessions were made under duress. In an attempt to uproot the opposition and end street protests, Iran began two mass trials of moderates, including prominent figures charged with offences that included acting against national security by fomenting voter unrest. A Revolutionary Court on Saturday charged a French woman, two Iranians working for the British and French embassies in Tehran and dozens of others with spying and assisting a Western plot to overthrow the system of clerical rule. Espionage and acting against national security are punishable by death under Iran's Islamic law. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner urged Iran to free 24-year-old French academic Clotilde Reiss, and rejected accusations against her of spying and helping a Western plot against Iran. ""I want to clearly tell the Iranian authorities: these allegations are not true, Clotilde Reiss isn't guilty of anything,"" Kouchner said on LCI television. ""She did nothing but walk alongside protesters for one hour one time, and 1-1/2 hours another time. She did not submit a report, she sent a brief note to the director of the French Institute for Iranian Research, which is a cultural institute,"" he said, demanding she be freed. U.S. national security adviser Jim Jones, speaking on American television, said the United States had urged Iran to release three American hikers who were detained there recently. ""We have sent strong messages that we would like these three young people released as soon as possible, and also others that they have in their custody as well,"" Jones told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" The Iranian government acknowledged on Sunday that it had the three Americans in its custody, he said."

Senior metropolitan special judge ANM Bashirullah set Aug 30 for the next hearing, asking the accused to appear in the court on the day. Khaleda's lawyer Jaynal Abedin Mesbah told the court his client could not appear in the court because of security concerns. He asked the court to issue an order to the government to ensure her security. ""If security is ensured, Khaleda Zia would not have any problem appearing in the court,"" Mesbah said. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges in the court against Khaleda, her elder son Tarique Rahman and four others in the case on Aug 5. Khaleda, a two-time former prime minister, and the others face charges of embezzling more than Tk 2 crore by throwing up the Trust that allegedly exists only on paper. The four other accused in the case are former BNP MP Kazi Salimul Haque, Sharfuddin Ahmed and Mominur Rahman, a nephew of Khaleda, and Kamal Uddin Siddiqui. A total of 36 people have been listed as state witnesses in the case, investigating officer Harun-or-Rashid has said.

en.15.139.168.2009.8.13,Man City's Big Four bid kicks off at Blackburn,"LONDON, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester City begin their most eagerly awaited campaign for decades at Blackburn Rovers on Saturday at 3:00pm looking to steal a march on city rivals United that they hope will last all season. United kick off their bid for an unprecedented fourth successive championship at home to Birmingham City Sunday at 1:30 pm by which time the fans will have had their first look at Mark Hughes's new, megabucks Manchester City side. Nobody, not even billionaire backer Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, will expect the squad to settle immediately into a smooth-running outfit ready to challenge the Big Four of United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal. However, he will want to see signs of a return on an estimated 100 million pounds close-season shopping spree. Carlos Tevez and Emmanuel Adebayor provide a contrasting strike force, the former a diminutive player with the heart of a lion and the latter a classy finisher with a moody streak. Forward Roque Santa Cruz, midfielder Gareth Barry and centre back Kolo Toure also come with hefty price tags and much expectation. Hughes, who endured four years counting the pennies as Blackburn boss before moving to City 14 months ago, spent much of last season dampening expectations after the high-profile signing of Robinho. The Brazilian and his team-mates eventually meandered through to an all too familiar mid-table finish. STRIKING OPTIONS This season has to be different and Hughes, a former Manchester United and Wales centre forward, will revel in his striking options. Tevez, captured from United despite being hugely popular with the Old Trafford fans, had a first run out in a friendly win over Celtic last weekend. ""I wanted to see him on the pitch with Robi and Ade but you can't play everybody,"" Hughes said after the Argentine's 25-minute appearance off the bench. ""Craig (Bellamy) came off at that point as well but it illustrates the point we've got great options and great variation in the type of players we have in the forward areas. ""I've got a good idea of what I'm looking to do (against Blackburn),"" added Hughes. The Premier League programme kicks off with a lunchtime game (1145) at Stamford Bridge where Chelsea take on Hull City. Chelsea have not won the title since 2006 but there is a renewed optimism around the club following the arrival of manager Carlo Ancelotti from AC Milan. ""We have changed the way the team plays a bit,"" Ancelotti said after the Londoners beat United on penalties to win the Community Shield at Wembley Sunday. ""I am very happy ... I now know the players, I like their mental attitude and I like the organisation of the club. ""We are ready to start a very important season for us and we are ready to do our best,"" added Ancelotti. Arsenal visit Everton Saturday while Liverpool travel to Tottenham Hotspur Sunday. Burnley also begin their first season in the top flight for 33 years, at Stoke City on Satu"
en.15.139.37.2009.8.12,Govt to tighten screws on polybag makers,"Golam Mortuza Antu bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, August 11(bdnews24.com)Efforts to end the illegal use of non-biodegradable polythene bags in Bangladesh have been frustrated by a lack of manpower and dearth of dedicated mobile courts, say authorities, but the government is now set to take tougher measures against the continued production and spread of the environmental menace. ""Delays in implementing the mobile court drive against the banned polythene bags is one of the main reasons behind their continued use,"" Muhammad Shahjahan Mia, technical director of the department of environment, told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. In 2002, the government banned both production and use of 'thin' polythene bags of the type that are still widely found in shops and markets throughout Bangladesh. Mia said a recent government decision to kick-start mobile court drives, which have been stalled since the caretaker administration's separation of the judiciary in Nov 2007, would add much needed impetus to environmental protection initiatives. The DoE official's comments follow a recent call by the parliamentary standing committee on environment for tougher measures against the production and use of the illegal polybags. The committee, in a meeting held on Aug 6, said despite the ban on their manufacture and use, they continued to create environmental havoc in the capital and elsewhere by clogging water bodies and drainage systems. It found the polythene bags were partly responsible for exacerbating water-logging problems in Dhaka. However, retailers in the capital's kitchen markets say the cost of the plsatic bags remains considerably lower than that for net or paper bags, the two alternates promoted by the authorities. According to the committee's findings, polythene bags returned to the market in force towards the end of 2006. State minister for environment Hasan Mahmud, in the parliamentary committee meeting, said his ministry would strictly adhere to environmental legislation that banned the non-biodegradable bags. Alamgir Kabir, of environmental pressure group Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA), told bdnews24.com that massive quantities of illegal polythene bags continue to be manufactured in small factories in Lalbagh, Hazaribagh, Kamrangirchar and Chakbazar. Kabir said some of the 'factories' have even secured fake DoE certificates to conduct their highly profitable business free from official hassles. Official confusion also persists over the exact types of plastic bag banned under the 2002 legislation. ""It is difficult for the police to know which varieties of polythene bags are banned and which are approved,"" Lalbagh zone police deputy commissioner Anwar Hossain told bdnews 24.com. ""We need a technical adviser on this issue,"" he said. A polythene bag manufacturer operating in the Lalbagh area of the capital, meanwhile, told bdnews24.com that he had been doing business for the last two years without encountering any intervention from authorities. bdne"
en.15.139.319.2009.8.13,"Over 1,000 out-of-work dockers threaten Mongla Port 'siege'","Bagerhat, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)Over a thousand casual workers, who lost their jobs at Mongla Port due to a change in labour laws in 2008, have threatened to lay siege to the seaport from August 17 if they don't get their jobs back and receive payment of arrears still due for past work. The movement leaders told bdnews24.com on Thursday that they had informed the Mongla Port Authority and Mongla Port Stevedores Association in writing about their planned movement. After a rally and a procession at Mongla Port Call Station Square earlier this week, the retrenched workers declared that they will lay siege to the port, halting all work there, if their demands are not met by August 16. Over a thousand dock workers were rendered jobless when the Mongla Port Dock Workers Board of Directors and the Stevedores Association Call Station, or casual workers' booking system, were abolished in line with the Labour (Amendment) Ordinance 2008. Some 1,016 casual workers, who lost their jobs, claim that the Mongla Port Stevedores Association still owes them Tk 88 lakh in arrears. Earlier this month, on Aug 4, as a group of the retrenched workers declared a non-stop sit-in pressing their demands, the Mongla Port Authority paid them Tk 41 lakh in Eid bonus arrears from 2007. The Mongla Port Shipping Workers Union president Shamsul Alam said their demands included reintroduction of the call station system for casual workers, payment of uniform allowance and death allowance, festival bonus and payment of 'golden handshakes' promised to 741 workers in 2005, and payment of wages as per conditions laid down in an earlier tripartite agreement. Alam told bdnews24.com at least 50 workers had died since 2007 who were members of their union, and whose entitled allowances to families haven't yet been paid. ""A case was filed on August 26, 2008, in Khulna divisional labour court for continuation of the practice of engaging workers through reintroduction of call station,"" he said. He said the court on April 5, 2009, ruled to continue with the call station or booking system and ordered the authorities to show reason why the shutting down of the call station was not illegal. ""The authorities were given 15 days to comply, but neither order was carried out."" ""Under the circumstances, over a thousand retrenched workers today are going hungry and facing severe hardships,"" said Alam. Abdullah Mohammad Khokan, Stevedores Association general secretary and union enterprise managing director, told bdnews24.com, ""We are aware of the retrenched workers demands, but they'll need time to be met."" He also said most of their demands are ""illogical"" excepting the Eid bonus claim. ""About 700 of the 1,000-plus workers are also complaining about having their ID cards cancelled as they had no employers,"" he said. Khokan said levies earned by the stevedores had greatly dwindled as the volume of workload has fallen. Since 2001, the port's cargo handling has come down from 3 million MT to a mere 1 million MT, he said. Abdullah said the call station was shut down on August 1, 2008 as the Dock Workers Directors Board was abolished. He also said the Khulna court only ordered a 'status quo'. ""The retrenched workers, demanding reopening of the call station, filed the case on August 26 in the Khulna divisional labour court. The court ordered to maintain the status quo."" ""There's no scope for engaging the workers again as per the legal directives issued,"" he said. Mongla Port Authority chairman Commodore M Faruque said the port authority has no jurisdiction to meet the workers demands as they concerned the stevedores. ""We can only request them to be more in earnest in handling the retrenched workers issues,"" he added. bdnew"
en.15.139.333.2009.8.12,US trade gap widens on oil prices,"WASHINGTON, Aug 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US trade deficit widened in June to $27.0 billion, as goods imports increased for the first time in 11 months on the back of higher oil prices, a Commerce Department report said on Wednesday. Analyst surveyed before the report had expected the monthly trade gap to widen to around $28.5 billion. But stronger foreign demand for US goods and services offset some of the impact of the oil price increase on the deficit. Both US exports and imports remained sharply below year-ago levels, before the global financial crisis began wreaking a savage toll on international trade. The trade gap for the first six months of 2009 totaled nearly $173 billion, down more than 50 percent from the same period last year. At the current pace, the US trade deficit for all of 2009 would be the lowest since $265 billion in 1999. US imports of goods and services rose 2.3 percent in June to $152.8 billion, the highest since January. Higher oil prices accounted for much of increase, and imports of consumer products fell to the lowest since November 2005. The average price for imported oil rose for the fourth straight month to $59.17 per barrel, helping to widen the US trade gap with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to the highest since October 2008. US exports rose 2.0 percent in June to $125.8 billion, led by stronger foreign demand for industrial supplies and materials and capital goods. Exports of foods, feeds and beverages were the highest since October 2008. The politically sensitive US trade gap with China widened to $18.43 billion, the largest with any single country. Imports from China were $23.98 billion in June, while US exports to that country totaled $5.55 bi"

""The president will send the reference to the chief justice on Sunday,"" Shafique Ahmed told reporters after a meeting of an inter-ministerial committee on preparations for the mutiny trial at the Secretariat. The decision to seek the Supreme Court's opinion came from a previous of the committee on July 27, on how to try the mutineers responsible for the brutal killings of more than 70 people on Feb 25-26 at the Bangladesh Rifles Peelkhana headquarters. Most of those slain were army officers deputed to the border force. Shafique said the decision to seek opinion on how the trial should be held fairly, neutrally and be fast-tracked has been taken so that no question can arise over the proceedings of the BDR mutiny case.

en.15.139.88.2009.8.10,"Coco, lawyers may face forgery case","Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday asked Arafat Rahman Coco, son of opposition leader Khaleda Zia, and his lawyers to explain the forgery allegations against them after the government accused them last week of filing a petition with the court through a 'fake' power of attorney document. Coco's petition to the High Court, filed on Aug 2, challenges a money laundering case against him filed by the Anticorruption Commission in March this year. The government filed a counter petition with the court three days later, on Aug 5, accusing Coco and his lawyers of producing a fake power of attorney in filing the petition. The government sought permission to file criminal cases against those who were involved with adopting illegal means in filing Coco's petition. The bench of justices Syed Refat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury on Monday asked Coco, his two lawyers, power of attorney Taherul Islam Touhid and barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan to explain within three weeks why forgery charges should not be investigated. The court also stayed the hearing on Coco's petition. The same High Court bench is proceeding separately on Coco's petition that was filed on Aug 2 by Taherul Islam Touhid claiming power of attorney on behalf of Coco who is currently residing in Thailand. After the ruling, attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters, ""Their petition was filed placing false documents. The court took it into concern and made the ruling."" ""The court asked them to explain why the forgery charges should not be investigated and a case filed."" Mahbubuddin Khokan, Coco's lawyer, said only, ""The court has asked to know about the power of attorney."" Additional attorney general Murad Reza said, ""The court has postponed hearing of Coco's petition until the government's petition is resolved. Besides, a ruling was given against Coco and his lawyers."" Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told the court on Aug 5 that the proper official of the Bangladesh embassy in Thailand had not certified the power of attorney claimed by Touhid in the hearing of Coco's petition. Alam also said the power of attorney showed a false address. He accused Coco's lawyer Mahbub Uddin Khokon of falsely attesting his client's signature on the alleged power of attorney. 'Clearly forged' He said ""it was clear"" Coco did not authorise Touhid's signature and that the power of attorney was ""a forged and fabricated document"". Alam produced a fax on Monday, telling the High Court bench it was sent by Syed Golam Zahid, of the Bangladesh Embassy in Thailand. ""A legal document of a Bangladeshi outside the country must be sent attested and through the embassy. It was not followed in this case,"" he said. ""The power of attorney was not attested by a notary-public and is signed by a lawyer of a private legal firm."" Alam said, ""Barrister Khokon went to Bangkok on January 27 and signed on the following day. If the case was filed on March 17, how could Coco give the power of attorney to challenge the case's legality before the case was even filed? Doesn't it prove that it was false?"" The ACC case against Coco, filed in March under the Money Laundering Act 2009, accuses him of laundering funds to Singapore worth nearly US $932,000 and Singapore $2.8 million. It further accuses him of earning the money illegally from foreign companies in exchange for awarding government contracts between 2004 and 2007, when his mother was prime minister. Coco is receiving treatment at Bangkok on parole granted on July 19 last year after he fell sick in jail. Stay upheld on illegal wealth case In a separate development on Monday, the Appellate Division rejected a petition by the Anticorruption Commission seeking to appeal against a High Court stay order on proceedings of an illegal wealth case against Coco. b"
en.15.139.93.2009.8.11,"Russia sees US space threat, builds new rocket","MOSCOW, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States will be able to hit any target in Russia from space by 2030, the commander of Russia's air force said on Tuesday, announcing that Moscow will develop a new air defense system to avert the threat. ""The development of air and space offensive weapons by foreign states demonstrates that by 2030 radical changes will take place in the exploration of air and space as an integral sphere of armed struggle,"" Russian news agencies quoted three-star General Alexander Zelin as saying. ""Air forces of foreign states, primarily that of the United States, will gain an opportunity to make coordinated, high-precision strikes on a global scale at practically all targets on the territory of the Russian Federation,"" he said. He did not specify what kind of strike Russia could be threatened with from space or which other countries might pose a threat. Russia is negotiating a new nuclear arms deal with the United States to replace the 1991 START-1 pact which expires in December -- part of an effort by both countries to improve their thorny relationship. Russia's Defense Ministry said in June it hoped that U.S. President Barack Obama would not pursue his predecessor George W. Bush's plan to deploy weapons in space, warning that Moscow was ready to respond appropriately to such a move. The Bush administration ordered the Pentagon to start researching new anti-missile systems to guard against a launch from North Korea or Iran. Medvedev has said a ban on deploying weapons in space was a condition for further arms cuts as were mutual limitations on the creation of ground-based anti-missile systems. Medvedev is trying to persuade Obama to give up plans for a ground-based anti-missile system with components deployed in Europe, a project viewed by Moscow as a direct threat. Zelin said that by 2020 Russia would create its own new air and space defense. ""In coordination with all kinds of troops of Russia's armed forces it must be ready to deter potential aggressors at regional and global levels in peaceful times and to rebuff an armed aggression by its entire arsenal of conventional and nuclear weapons during a war,"" he said. Zelin said Moscow was now developing a fifth-generation, surface-to-air rocket, the S-500. ""It is able to implement in full the tasks of air and space defense and is capable of engaging ballistic hypersonic targets flying at a speed of 5 km (3 miles) per second,"" Zelin said."
en.15.139.332.2009.8.11,"Afghan troops, foreigner killed in Taliban ambush","GHAZNI, Afghanistan, Aug 11,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least three Afghan soldiers and a foreign service member were killed when Taliban fighters ambushed a convoy in Afghanistan's east, the Defense Ministry and military officials said on Tuesday. Police in the area said as many as eight Afghan soldiers may have been killed after insurgents hit a convoy of Afghan and foreign troops with small-arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades on Monday. The convoy was heading to talk to villagers about the August 20 presidential election, they said. Captain Regina Gillis, a spokeswoman for US and NATO-led forces in Afghanistan, said there were ""multiple"" Afghan casualties in the attack. Gillis said the dead International Security Assistance Force service member was not American, but did not disclose the nationality. Separately from Warsaw, a Polish defense ministry statement said one of its captains was missing in action overnight but found dead on Monday and four other Polish soldiers wounded after they were caught in a firefight during a foot patrol with Afghan troops. ISAF generally does not identify the nationalities of soldiers killed in Afghanistan, leaving it to the member country. With the election just nine days away, violence has escalated across Afghanistan. The Taliban have vowed to disrupt the poll. Attacks this year had already reached their worst level since the Taliban were toppled in 2001 and escalated further after thousands of US and British troops launched major operations in the southern Taliban stronghold of Helmand province last month. The Defense Ministry in Kabul said the convoy was on a patrol in a remote area of Ghazni when it came under attack. It said three Afghan soldiers were killed and six wounded. Abdul Rahman, a senior police officer in Ghazni, said as many as eight Afghan soldiers were killed. He said the convoy was traveling to talk to villagers in Ajrestan district about the election when they came under attack. ""We have also inflicted heavy casualties on the insurgents,"" Rahman said. Early this month the Taliban posted ""night letters -- posters pasted in mosques and on village walls -- warning voters not to leave their homes on polling"
en.15.139.289.2009.8.11,Shakib scripts 2-0 lead against Zimbabwe,"Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)  Shakib Al Hasan scripted a comfortable 49-run win over Zimbabwe in the second match of the GrameenPhone Cup ODI series at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Tuesday. The world's number one one-day all rounder gave another virtuoso batting performance becoming the fastest Bangladeshi to score a one-day hundred as the Tigers, put into bat, made 320-8 in 50 overs. Shakib made a whirlwind 64-ball 104, featuring nine fours and four sixes, for his third century. The previous Bangladeshi record holder was Alok Kapali with an 86-ball effort against India in the 2008 Asia Cup. For good measure Shakib returned to claim two wickets and was adjudged man of the match, which gave Bangladesh a 2-0 lead in the five ODI series after winning the opening game by eight wickets on Sunday. The second match marked only the third time Bangladesh has surpassed 300 runs. Earlier they made 301-7 against Kenya at Bogra in March 2006 and 300-8 against UAE in the Asia Cup in Lahore in June 2008. Despite some solid knocks from Sean Willians (75) and 61 from Charles Coventry, the home side were restricted to 271 in 46.1 overs. During the post-match ceremony Zimbabwe skipper Prosper Utseya agreed his bowlers didn't stick to the plan. ""We didn't bowl enough good balls in the morning and didn't vary our pace a lot. The middle order had a lot to do and we lost too many wickets early. We need to keep learning from our mistakes though we put in a much improved performance today."" His Bangladesh counterpart was naturally pleased with the outcome and hoped to continue the good form into the next games. ""We've been playing good cricket and hopefully we'll play just as well in the next game. Every time I come in to play, I keep getting better. Hope this continues. We need to improve in all three departments, but mainly fielding and bowling."" Both sides meet again at the same venue on Friday. The Bangladesh innings was lacking momentum before Shakib arrived at the crease, as the Tigers laboured at 108-1 in 25 overs. The feature of his innings was his skill in repeatedly picking the gaps: there were quite a few hits over extra cover, a few to the straight boundary and many swings to midwicket region. He started carefully, dealing in singles and twos to reach 15, before breaking free with two pulled boundaries. The explosion started in the 38th over bowled by the part-time spinner Sean Williams with Shakib, who was denied the services of a runner just prior to the over, swinging twice over midwicket boundary. He went on to crash Ray Price to the straight boundary before lifting Prosper Utseya over long-off and twice over extra-cover as he made full use of the batting Powerplay. He was aided by some poor fielding as he was dropped twice in the inner circle: when he was on 59, Stuart Matsikenyeri spilled a sitter at midwicket off an attempted reverse-sweep against Utseya and when he was on 71, Price dropped another dolly off a top-edged paddle-sweep. Shakib went berserk after the twin drops. He looted 19 runs, with the help of three boundaries that included a stunning six over long-off, in the 44th over bowled by Chamu Chibhaba and proceeded to indulge himself. He brought up the hundred in 63 balls and celebrated it with a cheeky scoop shot against Ed Rainsford before he was run out going for the third run after Mushfiqur Rahim had slashed to deep point. Mushfiq sought to make amends for his mistake by indulging in some big hitting in the end to push Bangladesh, who were put into bat, well past 300. The platform was laid earlier in the day by Tamim who struck a 71-run partnership with Junaed Siddique at the top of the order. Only four fours came in the first fifteen overs and only one boundary was hit in the air. It not only reflected the intent of the batsmen but also the lines and length bowled by the new-ball bowlers Elton Chigumbura and Ed Rainsford. For their part, the batsmen were absolutely focused on playing themselves in before going for their shots. Tamim, who received more short balls than Junaed, stayed adjacent to the line and punched the singles and twos to the leg side. There was a glide to the fine-leg boundary but the shot of his stay was a neat adjustment he showed against Chamu Chibhabha: He had shaped to cover-drive but adjusted to the slow pace by waiting a touch and gliding it to the third-man boundary. Junaed unfurled a couple of off-side boundaries and also hit a big shot, hitting Elton Chigumbura over mid-on and was looking good when he was run out 27 off 41 overs. He pushed Utseya, who brought himself on in the 11th over, to the left of short midwicket, was caught in a yes-no situation with Tamim and couldn't get back to his crease in time. Tamim, himself, was run out soon in a comical fashion. He had missed to connect a leg-side delivery but was stranded in the middle due to a faulty call from Shakib and was easily run out by the keeper for 79 off 105 balls. The other batsmen to reach double digits were Raqibul Hasan (35) who featured in dangerous 56-ball 96-run fifth-wicket stand with the Bangladesh captain, Mushfiqur Rahim (23 not out) and Mohammad Ashraful (22).

Five Italian tourists, the helicopter pilot, the plane's pilot, his brother and his nephew died on Saturday when the collision sent both aircraft plunging into the river that separates New York and New Jersey. Seven bodies have been recovered, those of three Italian adults, two Italian teenage boys, the helicopter pilot and the plane pilot's 15-year-old nephew, authorities said. An eighth body was found but not recovered on Monday, said Paul Browne, spokesman for the New York Police Department. He did not say which victim it was. The body lies pinned in the wreckage of the plane below about 60 feet (18 mt) of water, Browne said. The small plane had just taken off from the nearby Teterboro, New Jersey, airport at midday on Saturday when it collided with the helicopter, which had just lifted off for what was to be a 12-minute sightseeing flight. (For a map of the crash site, click here) New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the plane, a Piper Saratoga, appeared to hit the back of the helicopter, a Eurocopter AS350, which was operated by Liberty Helicopter, the largest sightseeing helicopter operator in the U.S. Northeast. ""Pilots' first responsibility is to see and avoid,"" Bloomberg said. ""Sadly sometimes people make mistakes. I don't know in this case who made a mistake. That's for the (National Transportation Safety Board) to decide."" The NTSB is investigating the cause of the collision, which quickly prompted calls for more regulation of air traffic above New York's waterways that are major routes for small aircraft. ""It's really too early to speculate as to what might have happened,"" said Debbie Hersman, chairwoman of the NTSB, at a news conference in New York. Hersman said the NTSB has issued safety recommendations that have not been implemented by the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA oversees US aviation and sets rules for airspace use, while the NTSB investigates the causes of accidents and makes safety recommendations. ""We believe that if those recommendations were to be implemented, aviation safety would be improved. I think the fact that we are here today shows that there is still a lot of work that needs to be done,"" Hersman said. On average, 225 aircraft operate daily within a 3-mile radius of the accident site at or below 1100 feet (335 mt), which was the elevation of the small plane in the collision, the NTSB said. The crash occurred near the site where a US Airways jet with more than 150 people on board splashed down last winter after hitting a flock of geese. All aboard survived. Bloomberg met with Italy's ambassador to the United States Giovanni Castellaneta, who said the collision occurred on the second day that members of a group of ten Italian tourists from the Bologna area took the helicopter ride. He asked for the inquiry to be prompt for the sake of victims' families. The dead were identified as Michele Norelli, 51; his 16-year-son Filippo Norelli; Fabio Gallazzi, 49; his wife Tiziana Pedroni, 44; and their son Giacomo Gallazzi, 15. New Zealand-born helicopter pilot Jeremy Clarke, 32, was also identified as a victim. The bodies not recovered were those of the plane's pilot, Steven Altman, 60, and his brother Daniel, 49. Daniel Altman's teenage son, Doug Altman, also died. Witnesses' photographs showed one of the plane's wings came off in the collision, as did the helicopter's rotors. Authorities said they do not expect to find recording equipment because small aircraft are not required to carry it. In 2005 two helicopters, including a sightseeing flight, plunged into New York's East River but everyone on board survived. A year later, New York Yankees baseball player Cory Lidle and his flight instructor died when their small plane smashed into a Manhattan apartment building.

The Rid Pharma officials stand accused of identical charges in the two cases  they are managing director Mizanur Rahman, directors Sheuli Rahman and Abdul Ghoni, and pharmacists Mahbubul Islam and Enamul Haque. Following the children's deaths, with suspicion falling on Rid Pharma's paracetamol syrup, the DA on July 21 ordered the company's factory in Brahmanbaria to halt manufacture and marketing of all its products. On July 29, health minister AFM Ruhal Haque announced that tests had confirmed the presence of the toxic chemical diethylene glycol in the paracetamol syrup.

en.15.139.431.2009.8.13,Fit again Foster and Brown set to lift champions United,"MANCHESTER, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ben Foster and Wes Brown are likely to be fit for champions Manchester United's opening Premier League game at home to Birmingham City after a close-season full of injuries and high-profile departures. With first-choice goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar ruled out for several weeks with a broken finger, deputy Foster missed England's midweek friendly against Netherlands due to a knock. However, Foster is set to return Sunday, as is defender Brown following his thigh injury. With Nemanja Vidic poised for another week out, Nani a doubt with a shoulder problem, Gary Neville struggling with a groin injury and Owen Hargreaves still some way off a return, the availability of Foster and Brown would be a significant boost for manager Alex Ferguson. United are notoriously slow starters and have failed to win on the opening day in three of the past five seasons. Ferguson knows that following a close-season in which Cristiano Ronaldo moved to Real Madrid for a world record fee of 80 million pounds ($131.5 million) and Carlos Tevez left for Manchester City, United will be firmly in the spotlight. The Scot has limited his spending, with winger Antonio Valencia arriving from Wigan Athletic, striker Michael Owen joining on a free transfer from Newcastle United and midfielder Gabriel Obertan signing from Girondins Bordeaux. SHOCK MOVE Ferguson has been frustrated by the big transfer fees paid out recently and refused to match what Real Madrid were prepared to splash on France forward Karim Benzema before making his shock move for Owen. Although many fans believe United will struggle to match the achievements of recent seasons, Ferguson says his squad are up for the challenge of trying to become the first club to win four consecutive Premier League titles. Having lost the Champions League final to Barcelona in May, the Old Trafford team will not be distracted by the Club World Cup in mid-season and Ferguson feels that could be an advantage. ""We'd like to do it,"" said the Scot. ""It would be a great achievement, obviously, because we all know what a difficult league it is. ""We accepted a good challenge last season, having to go to Japan for the Club World Cup in December and play catch-up. ""That was a great achievement to win it in the circumstances. But (this time) we don't have it and we don't have to play catch-up,"" added Ferguson. United are sure to miss Ronaldo's goals but the players feel they will be an even more solid defensive unit as a result of the Portugal forward's departure. Ferguson expects striker Dimitar Berbatov to improve and is confident Owen will prove his worth. ""Our approach to him (Owen) has been to say to enjoy being here, enjoy the training, and he has not missed a session yet,"" said United's manager. ""He has operated really well in all the games so far. He has shown some really clever stuff and I have been really pleased with"
en.15.139.345.2009.8.11,More Pakistan youth turn to music to vent against terror,"LAHORE, Aug 11(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zeb Bangash and Haniya Aslam are pursuing a line of work that not too long ago would have been deemed inappropriate for young Pakistani women of their standing: they're making music. Educated in the United States and from well-to-do families, cousins Zeb and Haniya, as their duo is known, are part of a rising tide of youth turning to the arts not only as a way of making a living, but of finding creative release from the frustrations of living under the threat of terrorist attacks. Especially in the cultural hub of Lahore, on the Indian border, a growing number of bands are sprouting up as part of a renaissance of the arts. Many are spurred on by defiance of the very Taliban militants who have attacked music, theatre and film through bombings and assassinations, most notably in the scenic Swat valley northwest of Islamabad, which they took over before being routed by government forces over the last few months. ""I think what happened in Swat with the Taliban really jerked the country out of a stupor,"" said 31-year-old Aslam. ""People started realising their culture was under threat, that they have to actually hold onto it, or else you're going to lose it."" While the most severe Taliban attacks have happened in the northwest, far away from Lahore, militants did carry out bomb attacks outside two theatres in the city in January. To the duo, who originally hail from the northwest of the country where the Taliban are rife, music is much more than a passing interest, despite any risks involved. They have both left their jobs to pursue their musical careers full-time, and have released their first album, named ""Chup"", meaning ""quiet"", an eclectic mix of folk and classical eastern melodies. Being female is not nearly the barrier it would have been even a few years ago, as the conservative Muslim country emerges from the impact of an Islamisation drive in the 1980s by then military ruler General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq. Other hangovers from that era, including a 65 percent tax on musicians' earnings from concerts, hit harder. With security a constant concern, concerts tend to be small and low-key, further cutting into potential revenue. ""The industry is new, but it's really exciting,"" said Bangash, also 31. ""It's also a little tricky, because the systems aren't really in place."" Given such constraints, not all young musicians are counting on making a living out of it. British-born Qundeel Sadiq, a 31-year-old who returned to Pakistan in 1992 and now runs her own television production company, views her band, Roadhouse Blues, as a part-time pursuit. She has watched the number of private music schools in Lahore mushroom in the past couple of years, and is pretty sure she knows why interest is growing so quickly. ""The country's gone through so much grief in the last couple of years that they really need an emotional outlet, or some art form or the other, just to get it out of their system,"" she said. ""I think the transition came first with painting, the next step was the performing arts, ... and then thirdly came mus"

""Displaying the two prices together will help shoppers appreciate wholesale price fluctuations and their impact on retail costs,"" Faruk told reporters following a meeting with the Australian high commissioner at a Dhaka hotel. Sufficient amounts of essential goods have also been stockpiled to meet demand over Ramadan, Faruk said, adding that this should mean the price of essentials remained under control this year. ""The district commissioners have been asked to check the price of essentials in the wholesale and retail markets, the information will reach us in a few days,"" said Faruk. He said government officials will supervise the markets over Ramadan to ensure essential commodities are sold at reasonable rates and in line with the prices gathered by the district commissioners. Faruk said dishonest businessmen regularly profiteered on increased consumer demand over the Ramadan period. He also said sales of essentials through the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh will start ahead of Ramadan. Anisul Huq, the president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI), who also attended the meeting, said market fluctuations were fundamentally an issue of supply and demand. ""But it is unfortunate that many retailers, wholesalers and distributors as well as certain producers take advantage of elevated demand when Ramadan arrives,"" said Anisul. He said unscrupulous market operators hike the prices of essential commodities by stockpiling goods and releasing them when the market conditions were most favourable. ""Supervision of the market by government agencies and the business community is insufficient,"" said Anisul. He said the government was now sincere in its attempts to control market prices"
en.15.139.170.2009.8.10,"Pakistan Taliban commander says he, Mehsud alive","PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A close aide to Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud, believed by Pakistani officials to have been killed in a shootout with a rival, said on Monday both he and Mehsud were alive. But Baitullah Mehsud, the aide said, was ill and would take no action that would make it easier to hunt him down. The comments by Hakimullah Mehsud compounded confusion that has surrounded Mehsud's reported death in a U.S. missile attack last week. ""Both I and our amir (leader) Baitullah Mehsud are alive,"" Hakimullah Mehsud told Reuters by telephone from an undisclosed location. Pakistani and U.S. officials say they are quite certain that Baitullah, an al Qaeda cohort, was killed in the missile strike delivered by a drone on his father-in-law's house in the South Waziristan tribal region last Wednesday. Baitullah's second wife, whom he married late last year, perished in the attack. Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said on Saturday that Hakimullah had been involved in a shootout with a rival for the Taliban leadership, Wali-ur-Rehman, and that one of them was reportedly killed. Pakistani intelligence officials and media reported that Hakimullah was most probably dead. Wali-ur-Rehman, speaking by telephone from an undisclosed location to Reuters on Sunday, also denied that any tribal council meeting, or shura, had taken place to decide on a successor to Baitullah. AIDE CHALLENGES GOVERNMENT Hakimullah said there had been no shura as Baitullah was alive. ""I have proven the government's claim of my death wrong and I challenge the government to prove the death of our amir. Baitullah Mehsud is alive, safe and sound,"" he said. The Taliban, he said, would produce evidence within days to prove Baitullah was alive. ""Let the interior minister prove he is dead. If the interior minister fails to prove Baitullah Mehsud's death, then I will produce evidence that he is alive."" Hakimullah echoed comments by another Taliban official that Baitullah, who suffers from diabetes, was ill. ""Drones are still flying in the area. The government is provoking Baitullah to speak on the telephone so that he can be targetted and killed, but he will not do so,"" he said. But Interior Minister Malik insisted on Monday that Baitullah was dead. ""We may not have material evidence for now, but we have credible information from intelligence agencies that he has perished,"" he told the National Assembly, parliament's lower house. Independent verification of the claims and counter-claims is extremely difficult as the Mehsud lands where the U.S. missile struck the house of Baitullah's father-in-law are remote and inaccessible."

AL, dissolving the old committee in its council on July 24, had announced its new presidium members and secretaries five days later on July 30. Monday's announcement saw AL dropping many known faces from the CWC altogether, following their ouster from the higher echelons at the end of last month. Former organising secretaries Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Mahmudur Rahman Manna, Abdul Mannan and Sultan Mohammed Monsur Ahmed have been not included among the new committee members. Former joint secretary Mukul Bose, executive member Abu Sayeed and AKM Jahangir were also left out. None of the seven organising secretaries had made the cut on July 30, but three, Abdur Rahman, Akhteruzzaman and Bir Bahadur, were named Monday as committee members. The vacant information and research secretary position was acquired by Afzal Hossain, while another joint secretary is yet to be picked. The 26-member committee comprises Mohammad Nasim, Abul Hasanat Abdullah, Altaf Hossain (Magura), Principal Motiur Rahman (Mymensingh), engineer Mosharraf Hossain (Chittagong), Sheikh Harunur Rashid (Khulna), Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya, AKM Rahamatullah, Syeda Zebunnesa (Sylhet), Begum Monnujan Sufian, Khairuzzaman Liton, advocate Fazle Rabbi, Bipul Ghose, Abdur Rahman, Akhteruzzaman, Bir Bahadur, Tipu Munshi (Rangpur), Mostafa Faruq (Jessore), MA Mannan (Sunamganj), Mojibur Rahman Majnu (Bogra), Mirza Azam, Momtaz Uddin Mehedi, Akhter Jahan (Rajshahi), Shirin Sharmin Chowdhury, Sujit Roy Nondi and Aminul Islam Amin.

Sidelined for more than two months with tendonitis in both knees, Nadal looked fighting fit as he teamed up with coach Francisco Roig to beat Serbian duo Novak Djokovic and Dusan Vemic 7-5 6-4. ""It's great to be back and I had a lot of fun playing with Francisco,"" Nadal told reporters. ""A win is a win and doubles is fun and important so I am happy about the way it went today. ""I am really looking forward to playing singles on Wednesday."" It was a positive first step in what is expected to be a testing comeback for the 23-year-old Spaniard, who opens the defence of this Montreal crown with a second round clash against either compatriot David Ferrer or Serb Viktor Troicki. Playing his first event since being stunned in the fourth round of the French Open on May 31, much has changed for Nadal as rival Roger Federer took his French Open and Wimbledon titles along with the world number one ranking. Federer's life has also undergone some dramatic changes. Since capturing a record 15th grand slam singles title at Wimbledon in July, Federer and wife Mirka have become parents to twin girls, the Swiss arriving in Montreal with his family in tow. BEAMING DAD The beaming dad said he was relishing his new parental duties, including changing diapers, but on the court the Swiss insisted he would be all business when he begins his U.S. Open build-up. Federer, who celebrated his 28th birthday last Saturday, opens his Montreal bid Tuesday against Canadian hope Frederic Niemeyer, who reached the second round with a 7-5 6-1 win over Russian Igor Kunitsyn. Ranked 487th in the world and the oldest player in the draw, the 33-year-old wildcard also became a father for the first time recently and is counting on Federer feeling the affects of a few sleepless nights before their match. ""I also played a tournament with my daughter after two weeks and I didn't sleep very much that week,"" said Niemeyer, after notching first tour-level win since March 2008. ""He has two (daughters) so hopefully he sleeps none. Hopefully he's a bit off and I'm playing well."" In other first round action, ninth seed Gilles Simon crushed Canada's Frank Dancevic 6-1 6-2 in a rain-interrupted match to lead a parade of Frenchmen into the second round. Thirteenth seed Gael Monfils made a winning return from a two-month injury layoff battling past former-champion Marat Safin 6-2 3-6 6-2. Jeremy Chardy also advanced, rallying past Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun 6-7 6-3 6-4 to set up a second round meeting with world number three Andy Murray. Paul-Henri Mathieu outlasted Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 7-5 0-6 6-1 while Germany's Rainer Schuettler beat Florent Serra to spoil an otherwise perfect day for the French contingent. Russia's Mikhail Youzhny provided the only upset on opening day, dispatching 14th seeded Croatian Marin Cilic 4-6 7-6 6-1."

Taiwan, Hong Kong, Philippines and Singapore are facing most trouble because of the damage to the Asia Pacific Cable Network-2 (APCN-2), BTCL managing director Khabiruzzaman told bdnews24.com. ""Repair work has begun, we have been informed by Singtel of Singapore, and the net speeds will be back to normal by Friday,"" Khabiruzzaman said. Reuters had earlier reported that up to 90 percent of all voice call and Internet services from parts of East Asia were disrupted after Typhoon Morakot damaged the undersea cables. A senior official of Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan's largest telecoms company also said services would be back to normal by Friday. Chunghwa Telecom, a former state-owned monopoly, shares APCN-2 with other operators in East Asia. TF Leng, president of Chunghwa's International Business Group, said they were working with other affected telecommunications companies in the region to use alternative routes to restore connectivity. ""We see that most Internet and voice connections should be back to near-normal levels by the end of Thursday,"" he said. ""The typhoon didn't destroy the cables all in one go, which would have led to a sudden outage of services. It slowly destroyed some of the cables, which is why it took a few days before users were affected.""

""I don't think we're at a crisis level where there is any move by the Taliban to overthrow the government,"" Jones said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" But he said Washington would not rule out an additional increase in US troop levels to secure the country. Violence has increased in Afghanistan in the last weeks of campaigning for an Aug. 20 presidential election that militants vowed to disrupt. The United States is sending 21,000 extra troops to Afghanistan in a bid to counter the Taliban, who now control a large swath of territory, and it has named a new commander to lead the NATO-backed effort. The American troops will reinforce roughly 70,000 international troops already in Afghanistan. NATO leaders also have agreed to boost troop levels by 3,000 before the vote. The Taliban have regrouped since being driven from power by US-led forces for harboring al Qaeda leaders responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said Washington expected the election would proceed as scheduled. ""The Afghan people are ready and waiting, and our aim is to ensure that there's a level playing field, that the Afghan people have an opportunity to freely choose their next leader in security,"" she told CNN's ""State of the Union.""

en.15.139.134.2009.8.11,Twenty miners presumed dead in Slovak blast,"HANDLOVA, Slovakia, Tue Aug 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An explosion in a northern Slovak coal mine most likely killed 20 miners on Monday in the central European country's worst mining disaster. Rescue teams found six dead bodies after about 12 hours of efforts in poor visibility and high temperatures, officials said. The rest of the missing group were also presumed dead because conditions in the shaft were not fit for survival. ""According to a report from mine rescuers all the 20 miners died,"" Economy Minister Lubomir Jahnatek said at the site of the accident in Handlova, about 195 km (120 miles) northeast of the capital Bratislava. ""Rescue workers are now 65 metres from the centre of the blast, six bodies were founds at this place."" The workers had been putting out a fire in the Handlova mine when the explosion occurred, the mine operator said. Hornonitrianske Bane Prievidza, the biggest mining firm in the country, said the explosion tore through an unused section of the pit, about 330 metres (1,080 ft) below the surface, at 9.30 a.m. (0730 GMT). At that point, all contact was lost with the crew underground. All the presumed victims were Slovak nationals, mine director Peter Cicmanec said. Many foreigners, mainly Poles, work in Slovakian mines. ""Most likely the source of the blast was gases left over from imperfect combustion"" from the fire, Cicmanec said. He said small fires of self-igniting coal were frequent in the mine, and there were several of them in the past days. Relatives and friends of the missing miners congregated at the mine throughout the day to await news from the emergency teams. A 25-year-old Radoslav, whose father was one of those presumed killed, said during the rescue efforts that officials had told the relatives already in the afternoon that there seemed to be little hope. ""They told us to prepare for the worst,"" he said. Nine other miners suffered light injuries and were discharged from hospital after treatment. Twelve people have been killed in previous mine accidents in Slovakia, a member of the European Union and the euro zone, in the past dozen years. Prime Minister Robert Fico and several government ministers travelled to the site to oversee the rescue effort. Fico said he would convene the cabinet on Tuesday to discuss aid and order a national day of mourning. ""This is a great tragedy,"" Fico said.

North Korea released two U.S. journalists and a South Korean worker in recent days in conciliatory moves analysts said could mark a change in tone from Pyongyang after it raised tensions over the past few months with a nuclear test and missile launches. Asked about the possibility of talks with the United States, Kim Yong-il, a vice minister in the North's Foreign Ministry, told reporters in Hanoi through an interpreter: ""We always keep the door open to negotiations."" It is rare for high-ranking North Korean officials to make comments to reporters when traveling overseas. Kim was in Vietnam for the second annual vice-ministerial policy exchange between the two countries, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said. North Korea has said in its official media that it sees as dead six-country talks, which also include the United States, on ending its nuclear arms program. The North has said in its official media it is always willing to try diplomacy with the United States but that Washington needs to drop what Pyongyang sees as a hostile attitude. The Obama administration has said it does not think Clinton's visit to North Korea last week would change relations with the secretive state and has said the humanitarian trip was not related to the nuclear issue. In Pyongyang, Clinton met North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and won the freedom of two US journalists held since March for suspected illegal entry. North Korea on Thursday released a South Korean worker held for nearly five months accused of insulting its leaders in a move that cold ease tension between the rival Kor"

""Unfortunately we did not manage to get a grip on the pain in the neck which occurred after the private F1-day in Mugello, even if medically or therapeutically we tried everything possible."" The 40-year-old had been expected to drive for Ferrari at the European Grand Prix at Valencia on August 23 with Felipe Massa recovering from a fractured skull. Schumacher hurt his neck in a motorcycle accident on a racetrack earlier in the year and had admitted he was still struggling with the injury. ""The consequences of the injuries caused by the bike accident in February, fractures in the area of head and neck, unfortunately have turned out to be still too severe,"" said Schumacher. ""That is why my neck cannot stand the extreme stresses caused by Formula 1 yet. These are the clear results of the examinations we did on the course of the past two weeks and the final examination yesterday afternoon."" His surprise return to Formula One after retiring at the end of 2006 was seen as a major boost to the sport, which in recent months had been plagued by negative news headlines.

The official death toll in Taiwan stood at 108 after the worst floods in decades washed out roads, sent dwellings crashing into rivers and forced authorities to deploy hundreds of helicopters for rescue missions. The storm has badly damaged infrastructure in Taiwan's south, a stronghold of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, and will likely worsen already bleak forecasts for third quarter economic contraction. Internet services were being restored, but repairs to undersea cables could take two months. At a rescue hub in Cishan, patience was running thin among relatives waiting for days for news of family members in the path of mudslides that flattened villages such as Hsiao Lin and Namahsia. ""How can they be so slow? Clearly they should be sending more helicopters, right?"" said Yan Min-rong, 29, as he pored over lists of survivors. Rescuers found 6,500 villagers who had been stranded near Alishan, a scenic mountain spot, Taiwan's Central News Agency said. But hundreds remained unaccounted for in remote areas. Taiwan's south has borne the brunt of Morakot and the opposition, in power from 2000 to 2008, has taken aim at President Ma Ying-jeou of the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (KMT). ""It's too slow. They don't care about the south. They just care about the north,"" said Chen Fu-rong, head of a funeral association in Kaohsiung, as she stood alongside bodies of victims. The military has deployed more than 34,000 personnel and 382 helicopters, it said on its website (www.mnd.gov.tw). Ma and top government officials have been touring affected areas. ""The disaster is huge and many bridges were smashed. Vast numbers of people have been affected and the weather has been very bad,"" said Tseng Ching-liang, an army colonel in Cishan.

en.15.139.20.2009.8.13,Scotland to decide soon on Lockerbie bomber,"LONDON Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Scottish government is poised to decide whether to allow the former Libyan agent convicted of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing to be released from prison and return home, a spokesman said on Wednesday. An American lawyer who worked on the defense team of Abdel Basset al Megrahi said the Libyan, who is 57 and has terminal prostate cancer, was to be released imminently on compassionate grounds. A Libyan official in Tripoli said an agreement was ""in the last steps"" but added that a deal had also been struck that neither side would make any official announcement about Megrahi's release until he was on home soil. Al Megrahi was convicted under Scottish law and sentenced to life in prison for blowing up a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie as it flew from London to New York on December 18, 1988. The bomb killed all 259 people on board, including 189 Americans, and 11 people on the ground. Frank Rubino, an American lawyer who previously worked on Megrahi's legal team, told Britain's Sky television that he had been told by al Megrahi's current defense team the Libyan would be allowed to go home soon. ""I am told that it will be in the very near future,"" he said. Libya has repeatedly lobbied for al Megrahi's release -- most recently at a meeting in Italy between Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown in July. British defense contractors are expected to benefit from any warming of relations between the two countries and al Megrahi's release would be the latest milestone on Libya's journey from pariah state to a country restored to the international fold. Libyan authorities made an application in July on behalf of al Megrahi, asking or him to be released on compassionate grounds and allowed to return home. Scotland's Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill met al Megrahi to discuss the application last week in Greenock prison where he was being held. ""LAST STEPS"" ""The deal is now already in the last steps,"" the Libyan official, who did not want to be identified, said in Tripoli. ""We have an agreement between the two sides not to make any statement until he (al Megrahi) comes home."" A Scottish government spokeswoman said ""no decision has been made."" MacAskill was ""still considering all the representations ... and hopes to make a decision this month,"" she added. Four years after al Megrahi's conviction, Libya accepted responsibility for the bombing and agreed to pay about $2.7 billion in compensation to the victims' families -- a move that helped clear the way for the lifting of sanctions and the restoration of Libya's ties with Western states. A decision to release al Megrahi is will anger many of the relatives of those who died. American Kathleen Flynn, whose 21-year-old son John Patrick Flynn died in the bombing, said it was ""crazy"" for al Megrahi to be released from jail, noting that her husband had prostate cancer 10 years ago and he is ""still alive and kicking."" ""There is absolutely no reason that someone who murdered 270 people should be released on compassionate grounds,"" said Flynn, of Montville, New Jersey. Pamela Dix, whose brother Peter was killed in the bombing told BBC television relative had not seen justice done. She said she had been ""baffled"" by much of the evidence in Megrahi's trial and said, ""There has been a lack of justice for the 270 people who died on and below Flight 1"
en.15.139.1.2009.8.11,"Tsunami alert withdrawn, country shaken","Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Environment Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)--The Met Office has withdrawn a tsunami alert it had issued for coastal areas in Bangladesh after a major quake of magnitude 7.6 struck in the Indian Ocean off India's Andaman Islands early on Tuesday. The quake triggered a tsunami watch for India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia and Thailand, according to Reuters news agency. On-duty official Abdur Rahman of Meteorology Department told bdnews24.com at 7am that the tsunami alert was no longer in force. No report of tsunami was reported from the coastal areas, he added. People close to the coastal belt were asked to move with caution until 8:40am. Rahman had told bdnews24.com at 5am that the quake, which was felt at 2:55:42am Bangladesh time, had its epicentre 980 kilometres south-southeast of the Met Office in Agargaon. Many in capital Dhaka, Chittagong and other places were jolted off their sleep in the wee hours by the aftershock of the tremor. Reuters correspondent Sanjit Kumar Roy in Port Blair, capital of the islands, said that in the northern part of Andaman Island, people ran out of their houses in panic. Police said there had been no reports so far of any damage. ""The room shook for around 20 to 30 seconds, it was quite strong."" The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake, initially reported as a magnitude 7.7, struck at 1:55 a.m. (1955 GMT on Monday). It was shallow, at a depth of 20.6 miles, and was centered 160 miles north of Port Blair. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami watch for the region. ""Earthquakes of this size have the potential to generate a destructive local tsunami and sometimes a destructive regional tsunami along coasts located usually no more than a thousand kilometers (about 600 miles) from the earthquake epicenter,"" the tsunami center said in its bulletin. However, an official at the Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services said a tsunami warning had not been issued by his department. ""We have not issued a tsunami alert and are monitoring the water level changes in the region at the moment,"" Ajay Kumar told Reuters by phone. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a chain of small islands hundreds of miles east of India in the Indian Ocean. A 7.6 magnitude quake is classified by the USGS as a major earthquake and is capable of widespread, heavy damage. An even bigger quake in the Indian Ocean in 2004 caused a tsunami that killed some 228,000 people. In Indonesia, a meteorology agency official said his agency was monitoring the Aceh area on the tip of Sumatra. So far there had been no reports of a tsunami in Indonesia but it could take two hours for one to reach the coastline. bdnews"
en.15.139.274.2009.8.15,<blink><font color=Blue>Letter from Washington</font></blink><br>Hillary's predicament,"By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)Is Secretary of State Hillary Clinton overworked and tired? Is she getting increasingly frustrated over being upstaged by her charming husband? Is there a fresh rift in their state of marriage? All these questions are being bandied about even before she arrived back home on Friday from her 11-day seven-nation grueling trip to Africa intended to reaffirm the new Obama administration's commitment toward strengthening America's ties to some of its most strategic allies in the troubled region. The trip seemed to have gone off well with a lot of positive media coverage until she arrived in the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as Zaire, last Monday, where a brief encounter with a Congolese student seemed to overshadow her entire trip. Mrs. Clinton was onstage in Kinshasa, the capital, in a town hall-type setting when the student asked: ""Mrs. Clinton, we've all heard about the Chinese contracts in this country ... The interference is from the World Bank against this contract. What does Mr. Clinton think through the mouth of Mrs. Clinton?"" Her angry response to the question quickly became a fodder for the hungry 24-hour cable TV, which played the episode over and over again, raising subtle questions about why she reacted in such a manner and what really unleashed her pent up anger. This is how she answered the question: ""Wait, you want me to tell you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. So you ask my opinion, I will tell you my opinion. I am not going to be channeling my husband."" Her evident irritation at the question quickly fueled speculation that Mrs. Clinton felt eclipsed by Bill Clinton's recent trip to North Korea, in which he rapidly secured the release of two American journalists who had been sentenced to years of hard labor on charges of illegally entering the country. After the forum, her aides told the traveling press corps that there might have been a mistranslation, and that the student actually wanted to know the opinion of her boss, not her husband. But that interpretation did not dispel the controversy either, since it gave new life to the nagging question of whether Mrs. Clinton felt marginalized in the Obama administration. Her unusual reaction also prompted some well-known columnists to cast doubt on the effectiveness of the most famous couple to further the cause of the Obama administration's foreign policy initiative. ""This raw, competitive response showed that the experiment in using the Clintons as a tandem team on diplomacy may not be going as smoothly as we had hoped; once more, as with health care, the conjugal psychodrama drags down the positive contribution the couple can make on policy"", wrote Maureen Dowd in Wednesday's New York Times. More troubling for the Clintons is the fact that her angry outburst has rekindled speculation about their state of marriage. Even nearly 10 years after leaving office, late night comedians, especially Jay Leno, still misses no opportunity to remind viewers about President Clinton's apparent weakness for pretty young women. At home, State Department officials are frantically trying to limit the damage caused by the Congo episode and urging reporters to highlight the core messages she has delivered during her trip on human rights, democracy and empowerment of women across the continent. The controversy may eventually die down but analysts say the episode will have a lingering shadow on her future role as the secretary of state. They also caution that she has to be extremely careful in her tone and action in the future and any misstep in future would prompt the cable TV networks to use the tape over and over again. And be assured Hillary Clinton is just not the secretary of state; she's a celebrity in her own right. And for sure, there'll be no dearth of interest on the part of the media to follow the celebrity wherever she g"
en.15.139.330.2009.8.10,North Korea wants better ties with US: security adviser,"WASHINGTON, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea has signaled it wants to improve relations with the United States and has been told it must return to nuclear disarmament talks, US national security adviser Jim Jones said on Sunday. ""The North Koreans have indicated they would like a new relation, a better relation with the United States,"" Jones said in an interview on ""Fox News Sunday"" when asked about former US President Bill Clinton's visit to North Korea last week. Clinton met with North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong-il, in Pyongyang while on a mission to retrieve two American journalists who had been held in the communist-ruled Asian nation. He was the highest-level American to meet Kim in almost a decade. Jones later said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that Clinton had stressed to the North Koreans that they must abandon their ambitions to build nuclear weapons and return to six-party talks at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula. The Obama administration has been trying to coax North Korea back into the negotiations while at the same time saying it wants to enforce UN resolutions to ensure North Korea's weapons of mass destruction are not spread. Pyongyang, which tested a nuclear device in May and has since launched a series of missiles, has insisted on direct talks with the United States. ""He (Clinton) did press home the fact that if North Korea really desired to rejoin the family of nations in a credible way, that the way forward is not to build nuclear weapons; and to rejoin the six-party talks, and within the context of those talks, that they could have a dialogue with the United States,"" Jones said. Washington has described Clinton's visit as a private mission. Kim, who has appeared gaunt and is suspected of suffering a stroke a year ago, appeared to be in control of his government and had ""sounded very reasoned"" in his conversations with Clinton, Jones said in his ""Meet the Press"" interview. Kim's health is one of the most closely guarded secrets in North Korea. There has never been any official confirmation of him falling"
en.15.139.36.2009.8.10,Reality show `Shark Tank' cashes in on recession,"LOS ANGELES, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Hollywood Reporter) - Here come the recession shows.The first of several new series attempting to squeeze ratings lemonade from the country's economy of lemons, ""Survivor"" producer Mark Burnett's ""Shark Tank"" arrives Sunday on ABC at 9 p.m. EDT/PDT with a timely premise: Five self-made billionaires offer their own personal stimulus packages for average Americans with promising business ideas. Brisk, sharp and surprisingly emotional for what essentially is a series of venture-capital-investment interviews, the show -- based on the Japanese format ""Dragons' Den"" -- balances the human element of its wish-fulfilling conceit with at least the illusion of the business legitimacy that made Burnett's ""The Apprentice"" such campy fun. Production values are predictably high, given Burnett's involvement, but this is a stripped-down, TARP-era spectacle. Whereas the wannabe Apprentices explored the New York jungle trying to curry favor with Donald Trump, the entrepreneurs here calmly enter the show's single-room set, we get to know a little about them, they argue the merits of their business plan and the ""sharks"" bargain over whether to invest. That's it. No weekly elimination, no traditional reality conflict or week-to-week story lines. Omarosa would be bored to tears. But viewers of ""Shark Tank"" won't be, at least not at first. The panel might lack the heft of a standout, name-brand business icon, but the quintet manages to come across as well-meaning and cutthroat -- after all, we're told, they're just in this to make money. Grating, dollar-worshipping software mogul Kevin O'Leary clearly is meant to be the standout Simon Cowell, but his attempts at catch-phrasing (""Don't cry about money, it never cries for you"") mostly fall flat. It's empathetic technology exec Robert Herjavec and real estate maven Barbara Corcoran who come across as the more complex, compelling TV personalities. Casting likable contestants has helped as well. After getting to know Tod Wilson and his fledgling sweet potato pie business, we care whether he can persuade a shark to help him make his dream of taking it national come true. That audience investment is ""Shark's"" biggest strength and weakness. Although the format admirably echews the oft-repeated elimination conceit that Burnett pioneered with ""Survivor,"" it's unclear whether a steady parade of new entrepreneurs still will be interesting after a few episodes. Producers likely will need to broaden the canvas, hopefully following some of the more interesting entrepreneurs as they try to make the most of their shark money. In fact, watching mismatched business partners try to work together might give this promising concept the investment of drama it needs to succeed"

Shahjahan Mia told bdnews24.cpm on Monday that the Saudi authoritiries was yet to officially announce the ban. Bangladesh is supposed to send around 59,000 pilgrims to the hajj, the biggest conglomeration of Muslims, late this year under government and private management. Officials at the religious affairs ministry said the Bangladesh consul in Saudi Arabia recently wrote to the ministry to say that the Saudi government has decided to clamp the ban pilgrims below six and above 65 years of age. ""We don't have any specific information about how many pilgrims will not able to go for hajj if the ban imposed, but the number can come down to half,"" Mia said. ""This will cause hurt Bangladesh, but the government will try its best to minimise the potential loss."" The Hajj Association of Bangladesh president Ibrahim Bahar said if the decision is finalised, a maximum 20,000 to 25,000 pilgrims will be able to perform hajj. Bahar said the hajj agencies have already spent around Tk 100,000 on each pilgrim for hajj management and will not able to get back the money, which means they will not be able return the money to the potential ineligible pilgrims. bd"

The deaths of Zarema Sadulayeva and her husband Alik Dzhabrailov were the latest in a string of killings in the region, where Moscow twice fought wars against separatists following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Armed men seized the couple from the office of the Save the Generations charity in the regional capital Grozny on Monday, said Memorial official Alexander Cherkasov, whose organization tracks kidnappings in the region. ""Both bodies were found this morning in the Chernorechye suburb of Grozny,"" Cherkasov told Reuters. Local officials said they had opened a criminal probe but the motive for the killings was unclear. The Save the Generations charity that Sadulayeva headed, provides medical and psychological help to young people who have suffered as a result of violence in Chechnya, including children who lost limbs during the region's separatist wars. ""There was no political element (to their work),"" said Lyudmila Alexeyeva of the Moscow Helsinki rights group. ""They just helped disabled children and children from poor families...It just shows that anyone whose position allows them a gun can kill whoever they like."" Last month leading Chechen rights activist Natalia Estemirova was kidnapped and murdered by unknown assailants, triggering international outrage. Memorial accused Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov of ordering her killing because of her strong criticism of his government. President Dmitry Medvedev promised a thorough investigation but dismissed suggestions Kadyrov was involved. Kadyrov himself has also denied involvement but his remarks in an interview last weekend with Radio Free Europe that Estemirova ""never had any honor or sense of shame"" and ""would say stupid things"" caused further controversy. The government blames Islamic militants for a rise in attacks on security forces and local officials in Chechnya and neighboring North Caucasus provinces in the past few months. Kadyrov, installed as a local strongman by the Kremlin to calm unrest in Chechnya, has found himself repeatedly accused of ordering extra-judicial killings after a growing number of his critics and political opponents have been murdered.

It is Zimbabwe's highest score against Bangladesh beating 310-6 made in Dhaka in March 1999. Masakadza who was out for 102 featured in a brilliant fourth-wicket stand of 142 with Taylor, looking set to complete his first three-figure score in limited-overs cricket, before being run out by Shakib Al Hasan while trying attempting a second run. Taylor took a backseat after Elton Chigumbura slammed 61 off 33 balls studded with five sixes and three fours. His fifty came off just 26 balls. Stuart Matsikenyeri made a nine-ball 23. Charles Coventry was run out for 22. Charles Coventry was run out for 22. Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan grabbed 2-65 while Mahbubul Alam was expensive with 2-84 from nine overs. Syed Rasel took 1-59 Zimbabwe, put into bat, lost both openers cheaply. Mark Vermeulen was caught at midwicket by Mahmudullah Riyad for 10 off Mahbubul Alam in the fourth over after adding 11 runs for the second wicket with Hamilton Masakadza. The right-arm paceman also claimed Vusi Sibanda ( 0 ) after he was caught behind with the score on six off the fourth ball of the second over. The Tigers lead the five-match series 2-0 after winning the first two games by eight wickets and 49 runs respectively. A win today will be their eighth in a row, which will be one short of their record best in ODIs. It will also ensure Shakib Al Hasan's men only their fourth overseas ODI series triumph.

More than 850 have so far tested positive for the virus, Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said, with about 340 still undergoing treatment and the rest discharged from hospitals. ""We need to work a little harder as the rate at which cases are being reported has gone up,"" he said late on Monday. India was importing more supplies of flu drug Tamiflu and testing kits, asking private hospitals to help state-run hospitals cope with a surge in people rushing to get tested. The flu drug is still supplied only by the state and will not be made available in pharmacies, Azad said. Three Indian drug firms were working on a vaccine, although it could take 5-7 months to make one available, he said. In southern Hyderabad city, where the world badminton championships are being held, a Malaysian coach was quarantined on Tuesday with symptoms of the flu, a government coordinator said. In Maharashtra, which has six of the eight fatalities so far, schools, malls and cinema halls in Pune have shut and companies are restricting travel to and from the industrial hub, about 180 km from Mumbai. A team from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases was in the state to check the formation of clusters, the Indian Express paper said, citing a state health official. H1N1 swine flu is unstoppable, according to the World Health Organisation, which has given up on trying to keep a precise count of cases. Experts consider the pandemic to be moderate at this point, meaning it can kill people and put many in hospital, sometimes with severe illness. But most people get a mild illness and get better with little or no treatment. That hasn't stopped wall-to-wall coverage in the local media. In Mumbai, commuters on crowded local trains wore face masks or handkerchiefs, and several pharmacies were selling swine flu masks and hand sanitisers at several times the regular price. Several schools have closed for a week, although Azad said simply closing schools would not help contain the virus if children chose instead to go to the mall or to parties. ""Mere closing of schools is not going to solve the problem. But we've left it to the states to decide,"" he said. The flu has also disrupted the business of Bollywood, with the shoot for film 'Kurbaan' (""sacrifice"") in Pune cancelled.

The team had already arrived in India for the championships, due to start on Monday, but will return home immediately.

""Following those reports, Badminton England felt the risk to the safety of the team was one they could not take."" Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said the federation had taken advice from the British Foreign Office and High Commission in India, although the Foreign Office said it had not warned them of a specific threat. ""The decision to withdraw from the world championship was entirely theirs, and they took the decision based on their own assessment on the ground and the Foreign Office travel advice for India which warns of a high general threat level ... although it doesn't warn specifically against travel to Hyderabad,"" a Foreign Office spokesman said.

Badminton World Federation's (BWF) chief operating officer Thomas Lund told a news conference that although England's decision was unfortunate their withdrawal was not a reflection on the security plan in place for the world championships.

en.15.139.425.2009.8.12,"<blink><font color=Blue>OPINION</font></blink><br>Why Pakistan, US see Taliban through different lenses","GLOBALPOST By HDS Greenway Boston, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - It's been clear for years that Pakistan and the United States are not in full agreement about the nature of the extremist threat or the war in Afghanistan. The U.S. is at war with the Taliban because it once harbored Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda gang. But in Pakistan's view, the Taliban was a useful creation to bring stability to warlord-torn Afghanistan after the Soviets left, and it might be useful again once the Americans leave, as every other foreign power has done after trying and failing to subdue the Afghans by force. When the U.S. failed to capture either the Taliban or Al Qaeda's top leadership back in 2001, the extremists moved their operation over the border into Pakistan to set up shop in the mountains and border towns of the Northwest Frontier Province and Baluchistan. Thus, as many Pakistanis see it, the U.S. war in Afghanistan simply swept the extremists over the border into Pakistan. And Pakistan is afraid that the Obama troop surge will drive even more militants its way, creating ever more problems for Pakistan. Instead of going into Afghanistan to root out Al Qaeda, and then leaving, the U.S. has undertaken to create a modern and unified pro-Western state. This gives new life to the once-defeated Taliban who can now claim to be fighting to free Afghanistan from foreigners. Whereas many of Afghanistan's other tribal groups had their own militias, many Pashtuns, who live on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and who make up Afghanistan's largest ethnic group, came to look upon the Taliban as representing Pashtun interests. Right after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. confronted Pakistan with a ""with us or against us"" ultimatum, which Pakistan accepted. Pakistan would join the U.S. in the fight against extremist Islam, but not as the Americans would want it. Pakistan was able and willing to capture and hand over Al Qaeda operatives, who were mostly Arabs and foreigners, but was less willing to turn its military might on its own citizens  especially in the frontier regions where the central government's writ has always been tenuous. Pakistan inherited the tribal territories from the British  self-ruling regions on the Northwest frontier that did not answer to central authority as other regions did. A quarter of a century ago I took a train from Peshawar, capital of the Northwest Frontier Province, to the top of the Khyber Pass on the Afghan border. I noticed that armed tribesmen getting on and off the train in the tribal territories did not have to buy a ticket. I asked a heavily armed tribal commuter why. ""This is my ticket,"" the tribesman said, slapping his rifle. The Pakistanis who live in those frontier areas consider themselves Pashtuns first and Pakistani only because of an accident of borders. Pakistan was, and is, reluctant to alienate the tribes. In Baluchistan, next door, there has been a low-level rebellion against the Pakistani state for many years. The last thing Pakistan needs is more trouble with the Baluchis. Compare it to the problem Obama faces with some Democratic congressmen. They are hesitant to carry out the president's wishes, not because they aren't loyal to the president, but because they know the president's program will get them into trouble with their home constituencies far from Washington. Thus Pakistan plays something of a double game. Doing what is necessary to please the Americans, but being careful not to further alienate their already alienated border regions. In the meantime Islamic militants are extending their operations down into the Punjab and the Sind  the Pakistani heartland. Pakistan is willing to crack down on militants, as they finally and reluctantly did in the Swat Valley, when the militants threaten the Pakistani state. But the Taliban was Pakistan's creation designed to end the chaos of warring warlords following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, and to insure a friendly power on the other side of their frontier with India. Pakistanis have long felt that America uses them when it needs Pakistan, but then discards it like an old Kleenex. They suspect that in the end America will leave Afghanistan in a mess to Pakistan's detriment. In Pakistan's view, to commit too many Pakistani troops to the northwest leaves the frontier with India under-guarded, and one should never underestimate the power of paranoia when it comes to Indo-Pakistani relations. India and Pakistan have fought three wars, in 1947, 1965 and 1971 , as well as a mini-war in Kargil, Kashmir, in 1999 that was sensibly contained. All but one of these wars was fought over Kashmir. Pakistan has encouraged terrorist organizations to harass India over what Pakistan sees as India's occupation of the Kashmir. An attack by Pakistan-based terrorists on the Indian parliament in 2001 nearly caused a fourth war with India and Pakistan both rushing troops to the border. But when a similar attack occurred in Mumbai last year cooler heads prevailed and India did not send troops to the border, as the Pakistan-based terrorists had hoped. Tension on the Indian border can only mean less Pakistani military pressure on the Afghan border, or so terrorists hope. India shares one great fear with the U.S.: It is that a nuclear armed Pakistan will disintegrate into chaos with Islamic militants making the country ungovernable. Therefore, despite provocations, India is moving toward easing tensions with Pakistan. It is no longer reasonable for the Pakistani military to fear an invasion from India, but paranoia doesn't bow to reason. India could make a further gesture by unilaterally lessening its military presence on the Pakistani border, but the U.S. has to accept and understand that Pakistan will never see the threat in Afghanistan through the same lenses as Americans"

en.15.139.248.2009.8.12,World condemns Suu Kyi conviction,"STOCKHOLM, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World leaders have condemned Myanmar's conviction of Aung San Suu Kyi for violating security laws, which critics of the military regime say is designed to prevent the pro-democracy leader from taking part in elections scheduled for 2010. The UN called for her immediate release after she was sentenced to a further 18 months of house arrest - where she has spent 14 of the past 20 years. The UN Security Council adjourned an emergency session after the sentencing on Tuesday and will resume deliberations on Wednesday. The European Union said it would toughen its sanctions against Myanmar after Tuesday's latest conviction of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. France and Britain called for global arms and economic embargoes. Suu Kyi was sentenced on Tuesday to a further 18 months in detention after an American man breached the terms of her house arrest by swimming uninvited to her lakeside home in May. Sweden said the EU would ""further reinforce its restrictive measures targeting the regime of Burma/Myanmar, including its economic interests"", but gave no further details. ""The proceedings against Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, on charges that were brought 20 years after she was first wrongfully arrested, have been in breach of national and international law,"" it said, demanding her immediate and unconditional release. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the verdict was a political step by the military rulers of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, to prevent Suu Kyi taking part in elections next year. ""The Burmese authorities have shown with this iniquitous ruling their decision to ignore pressing messages from the international community,"" Sarkozy's office said in a statement. ""The president asks the European Union to react rapidly by adopting new sanctions against the Burmese regime, which should particularly target the resources that it profits directly from -- wood and ruby mining."" French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said there should be a global embargo on arms sales to Myanmar and a ""robust mechanism"" to keep track of wood and ruby exports. The EU has long prohibited any transfer of arms from the bloc to Myanmar, or equipment that might be used for internal repression. After a crackdown on pro-democracy protests led by Buddhist monks in Sept. 2007, it targeted 1,207 Myanmar firms with measures including visa bans and asset freezes. It also maintains a visa ban and asset freezes on members of the military government and its backers. Brown said in a statement he was ""saddened and angry"" at the ""monstrous"" verdict. ""The facade of (Suu Kyi's) prosecution is made more monstrous because its real objective is to sever her bond with the people for whom she is a beacon of hope and resistance,"" he said, calling for the U.N. Security Council to impose a worldwide ban on arms sales to Myanmar."

Despite a valiant 78 by Raqibul Hasan, the Tigers innings folded on 254 in 44.2 overs in response to the home side's huge 323-7, which is their highest total against the tourists. Their previous highest was 310-6 made in Dhaka in March 1999. The result keeps the series alive as the Tigers now lead 2-1 after winning the first two games by eight wickets and 49 runs respectively. Had Shakib Al Hasan's men won it would have been their eighth in a row, one short of their record best in ODIs. Moreover, only their fourth overseas ODI series triumph. Earlier, Bangladesh trounced Kenya 3-0 in 2006, outplayed Zimbabwe 3-1 in 2006-07 and last month inflicted a three-nil whitewash over West Indies. Elton Chigumbura with his quickfire fifty was named man of the match. In the post-match ceremony, Shakib said: ""We didn't bowl well. It was a tough day for us; hopefully we woudl come back in the next game. We didn't start well with the bat. Only 80 runs were needed in the last overs but we didn't have wickets."" His Zimbabwe counterpart Prosper Utseya: ""The guys managed to come to the party today. Form is temporary, class is permanent. I think our batting can still improve. On that wicket, 350 is a good score."" Man of the Match: Chigumbura: ""It was a good innings. The guys upfront did a good job to help me come in and play my game. We have to do well on Sunday to level the series."" The fourth match will be played at the same venue on Sunday. Tawanda Mupawira set the tone with the dismissal of Tamim Iqbal first ball, and Bangladesh proceeded to stumble in the face of a stiff target. The bowler also got the prized-wicket of Mohammad Ashraful in between Elton Chigumbura sent back promoted opener Naeem Islam for four. Any thoughts of another amazing knock from Shakib Al Hasan faded after he fell 17 with the score on 39 in the eighth over. Vice-captain Mushfiqur Rahim and Raqibul Hasan then staged a mini-fightback with 68 runs for the fifth wicket before Mushfiq was caught at long-on by Charles Coventry off Ray Price. The left-arm spinner also claimed Mahmudullah Riyad (14) who was dismissed in similar fashion Raqibul Hasan held the innings together before eventually bowled by Masakadza for 78 off 83 balls featuring four boundaries and two sixes. Number nine batsman Mahbubul Alam helped himself to career-best 43-ball 57. Ray Price finished with 3-34, Tawanda Mupariwa 3-32, Elton Chigumbura 2-46 and Masakadza 1-37. Earlier, Hamilton Masakadza scored a maiden one-day hundred (102) to propel Zimbabwe to their record score. He also featured in a brilliant fourth-wicket stand of 142 with Brendan Taylor (94). The stand was broken after the former was bowled by Syed Rasel. Taylor, looking set to complete his first three-figure score in limited-overs cricket, before being run out by Shakib Al Hasan while trying attempting a second run. Taylor took a backseat after Elton Chigumbura slammed 61 off 33 balls studded with five sixes and three fours. His fifty came off just 26 balls. Stuart Matsikenyeri made a nine-ball 23 and Charles Coventry was run out for 22. Shakib Al Hasan grabbed 2-65 while Mahbubul Alam was expensive with 2-84 from nine overs. Syed Rasel took 1-59 Zimbabwe, put into bat, lost both openers cheaply. Mark Vermeulen was caught at midwicket by Mahmudullah Riyad for 10 off Mahbubul Alam in the fourth over.

The trio were released by England to get match practice before next week's deciding Ashes Test against Australia but things did not quite work out as planned. Essex batsman Bopara was caught off Middlesex seamer Tim Murtagh in the slips for one playing another indecisive defensive prod and the same bowler trapped his Cook lbw for four. Bell was caught behind off Yorkshire's Ryan Sidebottom for one and his Warwickshire team mate Jonathan Trott, hoping to make his test debut next week, fell soon afterwards for 15. Kent's Robert Key, another batsman potentially in line for a recall, scored 90 on Tuesday. Veteran Mark Ramprakash has not yet batted in Surrey's match and Marcus Trescothick's Somerset do not have a first-class game this week.

en.15.139.279.2009.8.11,UK's S Asian children more prone to Type 2 diabetes,"By Syed Nahas Pasha London, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)--Children of Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani origin in the UK are 13 times more likely to have Type 2 diabetes than white children, according to one of Britain's leading health charities. Diabetes UK is the leading charity for the three million people in the UK with diabetes and was set up on Jan 10, 1934 by the novelist HG Wells, the author of The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds--and Dr RD Lawrence, both of whom had diabetes. The charity's aim is to ensure that everyone in the UK gains access to insulin, whatever their financial situation. The charity's report also revealed one person is diagnosed with diabetes every three minutes in the UK. The report ""Diabetes in the UK 2009"" is particularly worrying as Type 2 diabetes is usually only found in South Asian adults who are over 25. Type 2 diabetes is up to six times more common in people of South Asian descent, according to the Department of Health in UK. British Heart Foundation statistics also revealed those who have diabetes are three times more likely to have heart diseasejust one of the devastating complications of diabetes. Douglas Smallwood, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: ""It is very worrying that any child is developing Type 2 diabetes as it is usually only found in adults, but it is particularly alarming that South Asian children are at such high risk. ""South Asian people are more likely to develop the condition and factors such as eating traditional foods high in salt and fat alongside western 'fast foods' compound their risk. ""Type 2 diabetes is serious. It can lead to complications including heart disease, kidney failure, stroke, blindness and amputation. ""It is a genetic condition but many cases are preventable through lifestyle changes, so Diabetes UK is working hard to raise awareness of the risk factors and symptoms to give people the best possible chance of reducing their risk of developing it,"" Smallwood added. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body does not produce enough insulin or is unable to use its insulin properly. Insulin, which is vital for life, is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps glucose to enter the cells where it is used as fuel for energy so people can work, play and generally live their lives. Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include having a large waist or being overweight; being of Black or South Asian origin; having a family history of the condition; and being over 40 years old, or over 25 if Black or South Asian. Type 2 diabetes can be undetected for 10 years or more and around half of people already have complications by the time they are diagnosed. At risk waist measurements are 37 inches or more for men, except those of South Asian origin who are at risk at 35 inches or more, and 31.5 inches or more for all women. Symptoms of Type 2 diabetes include increased thirst, going to the loo (for a wee) all the time  especially at night, extreme tiredness, blurred vision, genital itching or regular episodes of thrush, and slow healing of wounds."
en.15.139.409.2009.8.11,Shakib savages Zimbabwe,"Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com) Shakib Al Hasan led from the front with a brutal hundred, his career third, against Zimbabwe to propel Bangladesh to their highest-ever score in the limited-overs version of the game in the second the match of the GrameenPhone Cup Series at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Tuesday. Shakib stamped his mark with an incredible 64-ball 104 that featured nine fours and four sixes as the Tigers reached 320-8 in 50 overs. The total was only the third time Bangladesh went past 300 runs. Earlier they made 301-7 against Kenya at Bogra in Mar 2006 and 300-8 against UAE in Lahore in June 2008. It was also the fastest ton by a Bangladesh batsman, beating Alok Kapali's century off 84 balls. Before Shakib arrived at the crease, the innings lacked any momentum as the Tigers laboured 108-1 in 25 overs. The feature of his innings was his skill in repeatedly picking the gaps: there were quite a few hits over extra cover, a few to the straight boundary and many swings to midwicket region. He started carefully, dealing in singles and twos to reach 15, before breaking free with two pulled boundaries. The explosion started in the 38th over bowled by the part-time spinner Sean Williams with Shakib, who was denied the services of a runner just prior to the over, swinging twice over midwicket boundary. He went on to crash Ray Price to the straight boundary before lifting Prosper Utseya over long-off and twice over extra-cover as he made full use of the batting Powerplay. He was aided by some poor fielding effort as he was dropped twice in the inner circle: when he was on 59, Stuart Matsikenyeri spilled a sitter at midwicket off an attempted reverse-sweep against Utseya and when he was on 71, Price dropped another dolly off a top-edged paddle-sweep. Shakib went berserk after the twin drops. He looted 19 runs, with the help of three boundaries that included a stunning six over long-off, in the 44th over bowled by Chamu Chibhaba and proceeded to indulge himself. He brought up the hundred in 63 balls and celebrated it with a cheeky scoop shot against Ed Rainsford before he was run out going for the third run after Mushfiqur Rahim had slashed to deep point. Mushfiq sought to make amends for his mistake by indulging in some big hitting in the end to push Bangladesh, who were put into bat, well past 300. The platform was laid earlier in the day by Tamim who struck a 71-run partnership with Junaed Siddique at the top of the order. Only four fours came in the first fifteen overs and only one boundary was hit in the air. It not only reflected the intent of the batsmen but also the lines and length bowled by the new-ball bowlers Elton Chigumbura and Ed Rainsford. For their part, the batsmen were absolutely focused on playing themselves in before going for their shots. Tamim, who received more short balls than Junaed, stayed adjacent to the line and punched the singles and twos to the leg side. There was a glide to the fine-leg boundary but the shot of his stay was a neat adjustment he showed against Chamu Chibhabha: He had shaped to cover-drive but adjusted to the slow pace by waiting a touch and gliding it to the third-man boundary. Junaed unfurled a couple of off-side boundaries and also hit a big shot, hitting Elton Chigumbura over mid-on and was looking good when he was run out 27 off 41 overs. He pushed Utseya, who brought himself on in the 11th over, to the left of short midwicket, was caught in a yes-no situation with Tamim and couldn't get back to his crease in time. Tamim, himself, was run out soon in a comical fashion. He had missed to connect a leg-side delivery but was stranded in the middle due to a faulty call from Shakib and was easily run out by the keeper for 79 off 105 balls. The other batsmen to reach double digits were Raqibul Hasan (35) who featured in dangerous 56-ball 96-run fifth-wicket stand with the Bangladesh captain, Mushfiqur Rahim (23 not out) and Mohammad Ashraful (22). Elton Chigumbura bagged 3-59 and Chamu Chibhabha took"

""The letter went out yesterday,"" said U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe. Iran's June 12 election, which secured hardline President Ahmadinejad's re-election, plunged Iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 Islamic revolution, exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite and set off a wave of protests that left 26 people dead. Western leaders, already upset by Ahmadinejad's anti-Israel rhetoric, Holocaust denial and uncompromising nuclear line, refused to congratulate the president on his inauguration last week, although their counterparts in Japan and Turkey did so. Among those leaders who withheld their congratulations to Ahmadinejad were U.S. President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The U.N. spokeswoman said Ban's letter was a ""customary letter on occasion of inauguration"" but added that the text would not be made public. The secretary-general routinely congratulates leaders after elections and the U.N. has released the content of some of those messages in the past. Okabe added that the letter was not an endorsement of Ahmadinejad, but ""takes advantage of the occasion of the inauguration to express the hope that Iran and the United Nations will continue to cooperate closely in addressing regional and global issues."" Separately, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi on Tuesday urged Ban to visit Iran to receive a first-hand account of human rights abuses. ""I ask U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to visit Iran,"" Ebadi told reporters in Seoul, where she picked up a local peace prize. ""He must speak to the families whose members have been arrested or killed."" Ban is also in South Korea, though it was not clear whether he and Ebadi had spoken. Last month, Ban said he was monitoring the situation in Iran but that he had made no decision on whether he should send an envoy to investigate reports of human rights abuses there. Ebadi says that more than 100 people have been killed. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other rights groups have urged Ban to send a representative to Iran and press for the release of those arrested after the election. Ahmadinejad is expected to come to New York next month to attend the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders. The U.N. Security Council has imposed three rounds of sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program."

On July 21, the Drug Administration ordered Rid Pharma to halt manufacture and marketing of all its products, including the paracetamol preparation. On July 29, health minister AFM Ruhal Haque announced that tests had confirmed the presence of the toxic chemical diethylene glycol in an illegal paracetamol syrup made by Rid Pharmaceutical Company that was suspected of killing at least 25 children in Bangladesh. Diethylene glycol, normally used in the textile and leather dying industries, was allegedly used in the preparation as a cheap but deadly substitute for propylene glycol. Speaking to bdnews24.com last month, Prof Abu Sara Shamsur Rouf, of Dhaka University's pharmaceutical technology department, said that unscrupulous drug makers have been known to use ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol as a solvent in certain paracetamol preparations instead of the approved propylene glycol.

Officials of the drug company were quoted in the press as saying Rid Pharma ""does not produce paracetamol syrup, only suspension"". The health minister said on July 29 that although the product was described as a suspension on the package, it had in fact contained syrup.

Sayeedi travel bar upheld on govt petition Earlier in the day, in Dhaka, the Appellate Division upheld the government's 'travel bar' on Sayeedi, just two hours after a High Court ruling declared the government's refusal to allow him to board an overseas flight ""illegal"". Immigration officers at Zia International Airport stopped Sayeedi from boarding a plane to Saudi Arabia on July 24. Sayeedi filed a petition on July 27 challenging the government's actions. On Aug 2, the High Court had asked the government to explain why its refusal to allow Sayeedi to travel abroad should not be declared illegal. On Wednesday, a High Court bench of justices Tariq-ul-Hakim and Borhan Uddin ruled the government's actions illegal. Following the ruling at around noon, barrister Abdur Razzaque, counsel for Sayeedi, told reporters that justice had prevailed and the judgement showed that the state could not interfere in the constitutional rights of a citizen without legal precedent. The government, however, immediately petitioned the appeals court for a stay on the High Court judgement. Appellate Division chamber justice Md Mozammel Hossain stayed the High Court ruling at around 2:30pm. A full hearing on the government's petition will take place on Aug 18. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam stood for the government in the High Court hearing. bdnews24.com/c"

The match starts at 2:30pm Bangladesh time. TEN Sports and Bangladesh Television are going to telecast the game live. The Tigers chased down the target of 208 with eight wickets and 15.3 overs to spare with Mohammad Ashraful hitting a majestic unbeaten 103. ""As I am no longer the captain therefore I have got to perform with the bat if I want to keep my place in the side.

The three-member bench of the Appellate Division headed by justice Mohammed Fazlul Karim rejected a 'leave to appeal' filed by the Anticorruption Commission seeking a reversal of the bail order for the former prime minister by the High Court. Khaleda secured bail from the High Court in last September. The graft watchdog filed the case on Sept 2, 2007 and the BNP chairperson and younger son Arafat Rahman Coco were arrested a few hours later on that day.

en.15.139.72.2009.8.13,Families split over Lockerbie bomber release reports,"LONDON , Aug 13,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Families of victims of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing stood sharply divided on Thursday over reports that the former Libyan agent jailed for life for the attack is to be freed on compassionate grounds. Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, 57, who is dying of prostate cancer, could be released from a Scottish jail as early as next week after his conviction for murder in 2001, unconfirmed media reports said. A Scottish government spokeswoman said no decision had been made, while a spokesman for Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond said the reports were ""complete speculation"". Megrahi's lawyer could not be reached for comment. A Libyan official in Tripoli said a deal was ""in the last steps"", but stressed both sides had agreed to keep quiet until Megrahi is back in Libya. Megrahi was found guilty under Scottish law at a trial in the Netherlands of blowing up a Pan Am Boeing 747 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie as it flew from London to New York. He was sentenced 27 years in prison. The bomb killed all 259 people on board, including 189 Americans, and 11 people on the ground. Relatives of British victims said they had never been convinced of Megrahi's guilt and broadly welcomed the reports of his possible release. ""I don't believe the verdict is right,"" Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the bombing, told BBC radio. ""It would be an abominable cruelty to force this man to die in prison."" ""FLYING A KITE"" Scottish lawyer and academic Robert Black, who helped devise the original trial format and has criticised the guilty verdict, said he thought the Scottish authorities wanted to avoid Libya portraying Megrahi's punishment as a death sentence. ""I think they don't want this man to die in a Scottish jail,"" he told Reuters. ""That is an overriding consideration."" Pamela Dix, whose brother Peter died in the attack, said it was crucial Megrahi's ongoing appeal in the Scottish courts was allowed to continue to find out exactly what happened. ""I am not absolutely convinced of Megrahi's guilt nor of his innocence,"" she told the BBC. ""We simply at this point do not know enough ... to be able to make that judgment."" Oliver Miles, a former British ambassador to Libya, said news of Megrahi's possible release may have been leaked to gauge public opinion before a final decision is made. ""Perhaps the authorities are flying a kite to see what the reaction will be,"" he told the BBC. ""These things can change and I think the public reaction might well change the decision."" However, American relatives of some of those killed said there was no doubt about Megrahi's guilt and he should be left to serve the rest of his life sentence in Scotland. ""There is no question in my mind that this man is guilty,"" Kathleen Flynn, whose son died in the bombing, told GMTV. Bert Ammerman, whose brother Tom was killed on the flight, said the release of Megrahi would be ""insane, immoral, reprehensible"", adding: ""He should finish out his term in Scotland, pass away and then send him home in a casket."" Four years after Megrahi's conviction, Libya accepted responsibility and agreed to pay $2.7 billion in compensation to victims' families. That helped clear the way for Western states to lift sanctions and restore their ties with Li"

en.15.139.159.2009.8.13,Study traces steady declines in US cancer deaths,"CHICAGO, Aug 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Improvements in cancer screening and better treatments have resulted in steady declines in cancer death rates over the past three decades, US researchers said on Thursday. They said younger adults -- those aged 35 to 45 years old -- have experienced the steepest declines in cancer death rates, but all age groups have shown some improvement. ""Essentially, the younger you are, the faster your rates are declining,"" said Dr. Eric Kort of the Helen DeVos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, whose study appears in the journal Cancer Research. The study uses a different way of looking at cancer death rates that measures improvements in cancer deaths by age. US government estimates suggest there had been little improvement in cancer death rates throughout the 20th century, with rates only beginning to improve in the mid-1990s, Kort said. But that does not tell the whole story, he said. ""The way that these statistics are traditionally reported is they have averaged all of the age groups together to get a composite rate,"" Kort said in a telephone interview. ""The problem with that is because most cancer deaths occur in older Americans, the average heavily emphasizes the experiences of older people. It's like watching the caboose of the train to tell when the train is changing direction,"" he said. Instead, Kort's team looked at improvements in cancer deaths among groups of individuals born in five-year intervals starting in 1925. Using that method, Kort said, ""Everyone born since the 1930s has enjoyed a decreased risk of cancer death, at every age."" People in the youngest age group -- those aged 35 to 45 -- had a greater than 25 percent decline per decade in cancer deaths, he said. Kort said cancer prevention -- including smoking cessation efforts -- have played an important role in these trends. ""We're also benefiting in profound ways from progress we're making in early detection and better treatments. Some of these advances benefit younger people first,"" he said. In childhood cancers, advances in treatments for leukemia and lymphoma mean many more people can survive cancers that were once considered a death sentence. And better screening for cancers that occur in older age, such as mammography in breast cancer and colonoscopy for colon cancer are spotting cancers at an earlier stage, when they are easier to treat. Cancer remains the No. 2 killer of Americans, with about 560,000 deaths annually, topped only by heart disease, according to the American Cancer Soci"

""It is a great addition to the Games,"" said IOC president Jacques Rogge. ""Boxing was the sole sport where no women were involved (in the summer Olympics)."" The IOC said the current 11 men's events will be replaced by 10 men's and three women's events at the London Games. The introduction of women's boxing, rejected in the past because of what the IOC said was a limited global appeal, does not need an IOC session approval as the sport is already on the Olympic programme. The International Boxing Association (AIBA) made a similar request in 2005 but it was turned down. ""This is an historic day for boxing,"" AIBA chief Ching-Kuo Wu told Reuters. ""It was a very important task to bring it into the Games. We are all just delighted."" Women will compete at three weights in London - flyweight (48 - 51kg), lightweight (56 - 60kg) and middleweight (69 - 75kg) - with 12 boxers taking part at each weight. In order for the total number of boxers to remain at 286 there will be one less weight category in the men's competition. The IOC also agreed on several changes to the events schedule of canoe competitions, replacing the men's C2 500m with women's K1 200m and replacing the three remaining men's 500m sprint events with 200m sprint events.

Johnson went into the series as Australia's trump card after a brilliant performance against South Africa earlier in the year but has failed to make an impression. The left-hander struggled with his line and length in the first two Tests at Cardiff and Lord's but finally rediscovered his rhythm at Edgbaston and then Headingly as the Australians levelled the series at 1-1. ""I definitely had the head drop in the first two Tests and was not really getting in the contest,"" he told Australian Associated Press. ""I was basically bowling my ball and walking back to my mark and not really getting in the contest that way. ""I think in the third test at Edgbaston that was one of my goals was to pump the chest out and get a bit more involved in the game and I think that has definitely worked for me. ""I definitely have a lot more confidence and am just enjoying it a lot more now."" Johnson was heavily criticised for his wayward start to the series and feared he would be dropped after his dismal effort at Lord's. ""Definitely it was in the back of my mind,"" he said. ""When you are not going well and you start thinking a lot of different things and that was one of the things that probably popped up in my mind as well. ""I bowled a lot of wides and a lot of short balls, so that was a pretty tough moment for me and to be copping it from the English crowd. ""I probably did not know how to deal with it at the time. ""But it was probably the most I have copped it before and I have definitely learnt from that and I am sort of taking it all in now."" Australian media had speculated that the cause of Johnson's problem was a public falling out with his mother but the paceman insisted that was not the case. ""Personal things do not affect me when I go out on the pitch,"" he said. ""I go out there and play my cricket and you don't want to have those things in the back of your mind so once I step out on that field it is all dead and buried."""
en.15.139.495.2009.8.11,HC drops Matin's no-arrest petition,"Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court on Tuesday refused to admit the writ petition filed by former shipping adviser MA Matin seeking orders against his arrest or harassment in a corruption case, a lawyer said. Deputy attorney general Mostafa Jaman Islam told bdnews24.com after the ruling that the bench of justices Tarique-ul-Hakim and Borhanuddin declined to entertain the appeal Matin filed on Sunday. ""In such a situation the petitioner's lawyer wants to move another bench and the existing bench drops the petition from the list,"" he said. Advocate Mohammad Giasuddin, the former adviser's lawyer, said in the hearing that the police had raided Matin's Chittagong house on July 31. Earlier, the parliamentary standing committee on shipping ministry had decided to summoned Matin, but made a change of heart on the grounds that it had the enough documents, Giasuddin said. Still, the police raided his house, the court heard. The chief of the parliametnray sub-committee that investigated him, Mohammed Shah Alam, on July 26 said that they would not allow him to defend himself with regard to the charges of irregularities in the container management deal at Chittagong port. The standing committee earlier unanimously accepted the report of the parliamentary sub-committee that found ""massive irregularities"" done by Matin and eight others on the last day of his office on Jan 6. The committee, however, did not find any evidence that Matin had taken bribe to land the company, Ishaq Brothers, the deal, Chowdhury said. However, Matin, a retired major general who was a director general of the Bureau of Anti-Corruption, the ACC's predecessor, maintained that he did nothing wrong. ""Former adviser M A Matin had direct role in awarding the work to the company in violation of the government guidelines,"" Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury, the committee chairman, had said. The chairman said former secretary Sheikh Motahar Hossain and seven officials were also involved in the deal. ""He (Matin) pressed officials to award the contract,"" said Chowdhury. The chairman said the tender was not invited properly in line with the government rules and the CPA did not hold any board meeting before awarding the contract. Besides, false certificate was given in favour of Ishaq Brothers, a ""novice"" company. ""Therefore, we have asked the ministry to refer the case to the Anticorruption Commission,"" said Chowdhury. He said the tendering process caused financial losses to the public exchequer. ""So, we have also asked the ministry to file cases to realise the money,"" said the chairman. Matin was also home adviser and chief of the corruption-busting national committee formed by the past military-installed caretaker government. The standing committee found that Matin had allegedly arranged a board meeting of the CPA in the afternoon of Jan 5 to evaluate the tender committee's report. The CPA initiated the file to award the contract within 24 hours to Ishaq Brothers after the meeting and couriered it to Dhaka by air, the committee said. The file was accepted on Jan 6 morning and the same was sent to CPA for necessary actions after the adviser had signed it. The file reached Chittagong in the afternoon of Jan 6 and the CPA awarded the work to Ishaq Brothers at 9pm when the new government was taking oath at the Bangabhaban. The standing committee also alleged that Matin had raised the service age of ""pilots"" at Chittagong port to 60 years from 57. ""He is not the authority to increase age of any public servants. This should be a political decision. He must be made accountable for this,"" Alam had said. Matin was the first adviser to the 2007-2008 caretaker government to face corruption charges. Housing and public works adviser Moinul Hosein was the other adviser to come under parliamentary scrutiny for allegedly awarding public land to his wife and son in violation of government rules. Alam had said that acting shipping secretary Masud Elahi and senior assistant shipping secretary Sharif Mohammad Masud involved in the deal had confessed at the meeting that Matin had forced them to award the contract to Ishaq Brothers in violation of government rules. And the officials of the CPA submitted papers which proved Matin's direct involvement in awarding the work, he added. Both advisers were very critical of the politicians for 'corruption' after the declaration of the state of emergency on Jan 11, 2007. The standing committee on May 27 formed three-member panel to investigate the alleged irregularities. bdne"

Pennetta stayed strong throughout the contest, while Stosur's game fell apart and she was unable to dictate with the big serve and forehand that had carried her to wins over Ana Ivanovic, Zheng Jie and Sorana Cirstea. ""I was afraid of her serve, but I returned unbelievable and I think that was the most important thing today,"" said Pennetta, who will rise to number 12 in the rankings when they are released on Monday. ""I've never won a tournament this size and I'm really happy."" The title was the 27-year-old Pennetta's eighth overall, while Stosur, seeded 13th, had been aiming for her first WTA title. The Australian finished with 32 unforced errors to only 16 for Pennetta. ""Sure, I'm disappointed,"" said the 25-year-old Stosur, who has yet to clinch a title in five finals.

His lecture stressed the importance of art in every aspect of life, from the personal to the civic to the national. Sir John, chairman of the Wigmore Hall Trust and chairman Court of Governors of the University of The Arts, London, and also vice chairman of the British Museum, was unequivocal in his belief that a vital function of modern day cities is to promote the arts. ""A city can never be an international city without art components."" Tusa spoke of Beijing's eagerness to build an opera house and arts centre ahead of the 2008 Olympics, because the Chinese knew its capital was incomplete without art components. The city opened the Xin Beijing Art Gallery in 2006 to promote contemporary Chinese and international artists. Hong Kong is planning to set up a major art centre in Kowloon, while Singapore already has an arts esplanade, said Tusa. He spoke too of recent meetings with officials of Saudi Arabia, who also want to include ""intellectual components"" in their oil rich state. ""The British Museum is also working with the Abu Dhabi authorities."" Having art components is not only vital for civic pride, said Tusa, art plays a role in the national and international spheres. If the British Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and Louvre Museum of Paris are in competition ""that is the THE best kind of competition"", he said. Tusa also believes contemporary art has turned from pure art experience into a ""by accident"" financial sector. ""Investing in culture has become a new resource."" He said the art industry generates income for many people and also boosts tourism and the national economy. Creative industries and contemporary art are very much related to each other. They have three important roles to play. First of all, appreciation of art. Secondly, the role as an industry. And the third is socio-educational."" As an example of the latter, Tusa spoke of art centres throughout Brazil and how the nation used art, dance, music as an integrated part of social welfare. Sir John talked about art policy too. ""National policy also impacts on the contemporary cultural establishment."" ""He said when art was dominated and regulated politically, or to serve an interest groupit always produced bad arts, the worst forms of arts."" Sir John Tusa helped to lay the foundations of BBC World Service Television, has worked in all parts of the BBC over the last 50 years, during which time he won numerous awards including a BAFTA. He is a regular broadcaster, and has written books on broadcasting, arts policy, arts management and the nature of creativity."

The clerics were killed Wednesday in Galkayo, a town on the southern edge of the semi-autonomous northern Puntland region. Officials in Puntland and neighboring Galmudug district accuse each other of ordering the shooting. Some residents said the sheikhs may have been suspected of al Qaeda links, while others rejected that and said they were from South Asia's apolitical Tablighi Jamaat religious movement. Mohamed Abdullahi, who was appointed as security minister last month after his predecessor was assassinated by a suicide bomber in June, said their identity was not yet established. ""Foreign fighters have been using this as cover and acting like preachers in Somalia. Nobody is sure if they were real preachers, but we condemn the killing of people in a mosque,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""I am warning Islamic preachers and all foreigners not to come to Somalia with such arrangements. They have to pass through the country's immigration authorities who can advise them on when they can arrive and where they should stay."" Western security agencies say Somalia has become a haven for Islamist militants plotting attacks in the region and beyond. Violence has killed more than 18,000 civilians since the start of 2007 and driven another 1 million from their homes. The country has been mired in civil war since 1991, and the administration of President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed controls only small pockets of the bullet-scarred capital Mogadishu. It is battling hardline Islamist insurgents in southern and central regions, including the al Shabaab group, which the United States accuses of being al Qaeda's proxy in Somalia. At least 16 people were killed and 20 wounded in two days of fighting between al Shabaab and rival militiamen in the central Galgadud region, witnesses told Reuters by telephone Friday. Abdullahi said the government was holding indirect talks with three senior al Shabaab commanders and with high profile members of another guerrilla group, Hizbul Islam. ""We are getting quite positive signals ... In the coming weeks there will be a good development,"" he said. He did not elaborate on the discussions, but said more than 50 Hizbul Islam fighters voluntarily disarmed this week. ""They had no deep political ideology.

en.15.139.296.2009.8.14,Poll shows Afghan vote headed for second round,"KABUL, Aug 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai leads the country's presidential race, but not by enough to win an outright majority in the August 20. election and avoid a second round, a new poll released on Friday shows. The poll, by the US-funded International Republican Institute, showed Karzai winning 44 percent of the vote, with his main challenger, former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah, winning 26 percent. With less than a week to go, the two main candidates are criss-crossing the country by helicopter and jet. Karzai flew to the Western city of Herat on Friday, while Abdullah was in the central mountain province of Dai Kundi. Western diplomats have said they are surprised by the closeness of the race, although Karzai remains the front-runner to remain in power, if not with a first round victory then by surviving a second-round run-off six weeks later. Just staging the election itself would be a feat, and fears that violence or fraud could undermine the vote are as palpable among many Afghans as doubt about the outcome. The Taliban, stronger than at any time since they were driven from power eight year ago, have vowed to strike polling stations and threatened reprisals against voters. Violence has surged in the weeks before the vote, with fighters staging a handful of bold attacks on provincial government buildings in the south, and also launching raids in once-quiet areas in the north and west. The United Nations says violence and intimidation have already disrupted planning and campaigning in the south, and could prevent many Afghans from reaching the polls on voting day. U.S. commanders nonetheless say they think violence will not be sufficient to prevent a successful vote. The election is a test for U.S. President Barack Obama's strategy of rushing thousands of extra troops to Afghanistan to tip the balance in an eight-year-old war that was not being won. Some 30,000 extra U.S. troops have already arrived this year, bringing the total Western force above 100,000 for the first time, including 62,000 Americans. The overall U.S. and NATO commander, General Stanley McChrystal, is due to release an assessment shortly after the election, which could be followed by a request for more troops. The new U.S. troops and British forces have launched huge offensives in the south to reclaim Taliban-held territory, taking unprecedented casualties. More Western troops have died in Afghanistan since March than in the entire period from 2001-2004. COALITION BUILDER Despite the worsening war and a widespread view that the government is corrupt and ineffective, Karzai remains personally quite popular. In the poll, 81 percent had a favorable view of him and only 17 percent had an unfavorable view. The poll showed Abdullah is also well liked, with a 71 percent favorable rating and 23 percent negative. A master coalition-builder, Karzai has accumulated the endorsements of many powerful regional chieftains, to the alarm of Western diplomats worried about former warlords carving up power after the election. But he appears not quite to have been able to construct a broad enough coalition to repeat his overwhelming single-round victory in the country's first democratic presidential election five years ago, when he won 55 percent of the vote and his nearest challenger got less than 16 percent. Abdullah, an urbane eye doctor with roots in a mainly ethnic-Tajik northern anti-Taliban guerrilla movement, has been seeking to broaden his support in the south, where his father was born. This week he staged a rally in Karzai's native southern city of Kandahar, attracting hundreds of followers. An Abdullah rally the following day in his own heartland of support, the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, attracted tens of thousands of supporters, probably the biggest crowd of the campaign.

en.15.139.64.2009.8.14,Iran to propose ban on targeting nuclear sites,"VIENNA, Aug 14,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran will propose a ban on military attacks on nuclear facilities at a meeting of the United Nations nuclear watchdog next month, Iran's IAEA ambassador Ali Asghar Soltanieh said on Friday. Soltanieh said a legally binding resolution was needed despite UN bans on such attacks because Israel had broken them in the past. ""The issue is prohibition of attacks and threats of attacks against all nuclear installations, during operation and during construction,"" Soltanieh said on the phone from Vienna. ""It is well known that this taboo has been broken in the past by the Zionist regime of Israel,"" he said. Israel has not ruled out military action to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and threatening the Jewish state. Israel and Western nations including the United States say Iran's nuclear programme is aimed at making bombs. Iran says it is for power generation only and has refused to halt uranium enrichment despite three rounds of UN sanctions. In 1981, an Israeli air strike destroyed Iraq's only nuclear reactor and in 2007 Israel bombed a site in Syria that US intelligence officials said was a nuclear reactor under construction. Syria denies this. Soltanieh said Iran would propose the ban at the IAEA's 150-nation general conference from Sept. 14 in Vienna. Asked if he was concerned about an Israeli attack against Iran, he said: ""This is not an issue, this is ignorable, because nobody would dare to attack Iran."" The IAEA has passed several resolutions, the latest in 1990, banning ""any armed attack on and threat against (peaceful) nuclear facilities"". Soltanieh said they were toothless. ""One of the things that we have to follow up on is to work on ... legally binding instruments, which are lacking,"" he said. Iran's move is the latest in a diplomatic offensive to try to turn the spotlight away from its nuclear programme, Western diplomats said. ""Obviously this resolution is presented to further Iran's political agenda and not simply because of an honest concern about nuclear security,"" said one Western diplomat. The IAEA's general conference will also discuss ""Israel's nuclear capabilities"" at the request of Arab countries, a regular item at the annual meeting. Israel is widely understood to possess nuclear weapons but maintains a policy of ambiguity. Western diplomats said Iran's proposal could lead to the sort of debate and divisive votes that crippled discussions at last year's conference. ""Unfortunately those issues will again overshadow the real work we have to do at the conference,"" the Western diplomat said. ""I could imagine that there will be significant controversies aga"
en.15.139.171.2009.8.13,Afghan Vote: Crunch time for Karzai - and Obama,"ANALYSIS By Peter Graff KABUL Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - When Afghans defy Taliban threats of bloodshed to stage an election on August 20, it will be crunch time for their care-worn president Hamid Karzai. But Karzai will not be the only leader with his future on the line. Thousands of miles away, Barack Obama, who has wagered U.S. foreign policy on a rapid and overwhelming military escalation in Afghanistan to defeat the Taliban, also has much at stake. Whoever wins, holding a successful election with a result that Afghans accept is crucial not just for Afghanistan, but also for Obama's revamped strategy to defeat the insurgents, the biggest foreign policy gamble of his own young U.S. presidency. Karzai is still favorite to win, either with a first-round majority or in a run-off six weeks later, but he no longer wears the air of certain triumph he carried into Afghanistan's euphoric first democratic election five years ago. This time, he faces two stronger foes -- one at the ballot box and one on the battlefield. Karzai's main challenger, urbane former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah, whose strength as a candidate has surprised Western diplomats, aims to win enough votes to force a run-off, while Taliban fighters, fiercer than at any time since they were driven from power eight years ago, want to cause enough bloodshed to prevent the election from taking place at all. POLL PREDICTS SECOND ROUND Western media sometimes describe Karzai as unpopular -- an easy assumption to make when you listen to Afghans complain about the rampant corruption, incompetence and nepotism in his government -- but although they often bemoan the parlous state of the country, polls clearly show most like their leader. A U.S.-funded survey this week found two thirds of Afghans had a favorable opinion of him, with just 16 percent having an unfavourable view. But it also predicted Karzai would win a disappointing 45 percent of the vote and face a second round. Despite the worsening war in the south and east, most of Afghanistan is at peace, its economy growing and its desperate poverty easing, if slowly for a country that has absorbed tens of billions of dollars in international aid. A master coalition-builder, Karzai has won a formidable line-up of endorsements from regional bosses, many of whom may be expecting jobs in a future government to the alarm of Western diplomats keen to keep ex-guerrilla chiefs from carving up power. But Abdullah, who emerged from a northern anti-Taliban alliance with roots in the ethnic-Tajik minority, has shown signs of winning support beyond that narrow base. The poll shows him easily placing second with 25 percent of votes. If he forces a second round, Abdullah could unite the opposition to mount a stronger challenge, although his northern roots may still make it difficult for the former eye doctor to win enough southern support to become president. TARGETING PURPLE FINGERS? Staging a poll would be hard enough without the Taliban's threats in a country where barely a third of the population can read and ballot boxes have to be hauled over mountains by donkey. Militants have broadcast threats by radio and spread leaflets, raising fears that voters' purple indelible ink-stained fingers -- once a jubilant sign -- could mark them for reprisals. The United Nations said has says that threats and violence have already disrupted election preparations and sharply curtailed public campaigning in insurgent areas, and could prevent many Afghans from reaching the polls on election day. Even if violence does not wreck the poll, it could make it more difficult to prevent fraud, and raise the odds of a run-off by suppressing turnout in southern areas that support Karzai. The Obama administration's response to the worst violence of the eight-year-old war has been a forceful U.S. military escalation, aimed at tipping the balance. About 30,000 additional U.S. troops have already arrived in Afghanistan this year, pushing the size of the Western force above 100,000 for the first time, including 62,000 Americans. More foreign troops have died in Afghanistan since March than in the entire period from 2001-2004. Outside battle zones, ordinary Afghans seem to be enjoying the campaign season, which has seen their cities festooned with bright campaign posters and candidates pass out free meals. The talk was all politics at the Faryab restaurant in downtown Kabul this week, where men reclined on rugs, scooping up fistfuls of rice and roast lamb from shiny metal trays. ""I'm voting for Karzai. These people, their pockets are already full. If we vote for anybody new, they will come with empty pockets, and until they fill their pockets, they will make all our lives miserable,"" said 33-year-old mechanic Mohammad Abbas, sparking knowing laughter from the"
en.15.139.326.2009.8.10,Australians rest easy after thrashing England,"MELBOURNE, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With this year's Ashes series marked by sleep deprivation and frustration for many cricket fans Down Under, Australians rested easy on Sunday night after their team trounced England in the fourth test to level the series 1-1. Although delayed by a plucky tail-end stand by Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad, the win shortly after lunch at Headingley afforded time zone-disadvantaged Australians a luxurious night's rest. It also gave them time to enjoy the Monday morning papers' pithy analysis of the innings and 80-run victory sealed within three days. ""Cop that!"" snarled the back page headline of the Herald Sun newspaper, in which Shane Warne's beaming face declared the ""Poms' spirits derailed by Aussie steam train"" next to his column. ""Ponting can see Ashes urn,"" the Australian newspaper declared, with one of the paper's staff keen to impart his own bent for clairvoyance. ""Ricky Ponting is heading towards one of the greatest triumphs of his career by shoving England into the Ashes guillotine that Australia plunged into four years ago,"" he said. The Australian captain, who has been a target of taunting from English fans, said his team would enjoy the 10 days' break before the fifth and final test at the Oval. He may also personally enjoy some respite from media scrutiny over his bowling changes, after his four selected pacemen obliterated the English bats in both innings. ""Australia's pace bowlers were superb. It's rare for every member of a quartet to be on top of his game,"" the Age newspaper gushed. LANGER STROKE Having blitzed England 5-0 at home in the previous series, Australia need only to draw the current edition to retain the Ashes, leaving the onus on England to force a win. As timely as the innings and 80-run victory in Leeds was for the new-look side's belief, former Australian batsman Justin Langer may be credited for another exquisite, if unorthodox, stroke of timing. A dossier penned by the gritty opener and given to the Australian team as food for thought prior to the series, cast the English side as flaky frontrunners all too easily cowed, has found its way into the British media. ""Aggressive batting, running and body language will soon have them staring at their bootlaces rather than in the eyes of their opponent -- it is just how they are built,"" read excerpts reproduced in Australian papers on Monday. Having been forced out of their hotel beds prior to the first day of the fourth test by a fire alarm -- Australia fans claimed responsibility -- the English may be wondering what tomfoolery might befall them ahead of the final test. They can count on little sympathy if the Australians take Langer's message to heart. ""They like being friendly and matey because it makes them feel comfortable,"" he wrote. ""Take them out of their comfort zone and they don't like it for one second."""

en.15.139.195.2009.8.13,US sees limited Iranian aid to Afghan insurgency,"WASHINGTON, Aug 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States believes that Iran has supplied arms to insurgents in neighboring Afghanistan but top advisers to President Barack Obama said on Wednesday that the information was conflicting and any threat appeared unsubstantial. Shi'ite Iran is not a comfortable ally of the hardline Sunni Taliban, but analysts say Tehran may be providing some support to tie down and irritate US forces in Afghanistan. Earlier this year, the US commander of international forces in Afghanistan accused Iran of supporting the Taliban but said he had not seen the introduction of sophisticated Iranian military equipment of the kind that was sent to Iraq. ""We get conflicting reports on that,"" Richard Holbrooke, the US special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, told a panel organized by the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank, when asked if Iran was supporting the insurgency. Holbrooke's senior defense advisor, Vikram Singh, said: ""Certainly, the Iranians have in the past provided some arms to some groups inside Afghanistan. I do not think it has been viewed from a defense perspective as a substantial effort or a substantial threat."" A US counterterrorism official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iranian assistance came mainly in the form of arms, rather than direct training of militants. ""There's reason to believe that Iran is supplying arms and other materials to insurgents in Afghanistan, including the Taliban,"" the official said. He provided no details about the types of arms. Holbrooke said Tehran had a ""legitimate role to play in the resolution of the Afghan issue."" ""They are a factor. And to pretend that they're not, as was often done in the past, doesn't make much sense,"" Holbrooke said, but added: ""We don't have any direct contacts with them on this."" Drug addiction is a major problem in Iran and Holbrooke said ""those drugs are coming across the Afghan border and it is a major concern to th"

Ponting will return to Britain to take charge for the bulk of one-day international series but the selectors wanted to give him a rest as they start blooding younger players for next year's Twenty20 World Cup in West Indies. ""Ricky Ponting is having his workload managed and will return home to Australia after the fifth test at The Oval and will miss the ODI against Scotland, the two Twenty20s and the start of the of the ODI series against England,"" Australia's chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a statement on Tuesday. ""This is the last opportunity we have to give Ricky a break until next year, with the ICC Champions Trophy, ODIs against India and of course a full domestic summer against the West Indies and Pakistan to finish 2009. ""The plan for him to return to Australia before rejoining the team is considered the most appropriate course of action. ""This gives Michael Clarke another opportunity to captain the Australian Twenty20 and ODI side."" Clarke's promotion is a further sign that he is being groomed to eventually replace Ponting as Test skipper. Clarke is the current vice-captain of the test side and has been Australia's best batsmen this year, scoring two hundreds and averaging 89 in the Ashes. The selectors named separate squads for the Twenty20 matches and one-day internationals as part of their building process for the West Indies next year. Promising opener Phillip Hughes and paceman Stuart Clark failed to make either side while batsman Mike Hussey and pace bowlers Peter Siddle and Nathan Bracken made the one-day side but not the Twenty20. ""We obviously know what Mike Hussey and Nathan Bracken are capable of in one-day and Twenty20 cricket, but with limited opportunities at international level in this format of the game we wanted to look at different players as we look to improve our Twenty20 performances,"" Hilditch said. ""Their omissions do not mean we won't look to them for the World Twenty20.""

en.15.139.392.2009.8.11,Strong earthquake strikes southwest of Tokyo,"HAMAMATSU, Tue Aug 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A strong earthquake jolted Tokyo and surrounding areas early on Tuesday morning, throwing food and bottles from store shelves, disrupting transport and closing a nuclear plant for safety checks. The magnitude 6.5 quake rattled houses across the Tokyo region and prompted the suspension of train services and the closure of highways for inspections, but there were no immediate reports of major damage. ""I was sleeping and there was a big jolt right at the beginning, so I leapt out of bed,"" said Rieko Yoshizaki, 57, in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka prefecture, the focus of the tremor around 150 km (90 miles) southwest of Tokyo. ""I was surprised ... and I hugged my dog."" Public broadcaster NHK said 43 people had been hurt in Tokyo, Shizuoka and other areas but there were no reports of serious injuries. A 5-year-old boy was taken to hospital after a TV fell on his foot. The area has been hit by heavy rain since Monday and the weather agency warned of possible landslides and flooding. ""Due to the typhoon, there was a lot of rain and the ground is unstable,"" Japan Meteorological Agency official Yasuo Sekita told a televised news conference. ""There may be landslides."" The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.5, revised down from an initially reported 6.6. The focus of the 5:07 a.m. (2007 GMT Monday) tremor was 20 km (12 miles) below the surface of Suruga Bay in Shizuoka prefecture, the agency said. TV pictures showed glass bottles shattered on the floor of a convenience store, a TV newsroom with videotapes thrown from shelves, and a temple where tiles had been shaken off the roof and were scattered on the ground. ""There was shaking for around five seconds and then a very big jolt at the end. A guest came running into our office to ask what was going on,"" said Chohei Murata, a hotel worker in Omaezaki, Shizuoka prefecture. ""A shelf toppled over and files came out, but other than that there's not been much damage."" Japan's Chubu Electric Power Co halted operations at its nuclear plant in Hamaoka, Shizuoka, after two reactors, the 1,137-megawatt No.4 and 1,267-MW No.5 units shut down automatically following the quake. The trade ministry said an alarm activated for high radioactivity inside the No.5 unit but there was no radioactive impact on the outside environment. Power was cut to 9,100 homes and the main expressway down the Pacific coast was closed for damage inspection. Many high-speed bullet train services were suspended for safety checks but later resumed operations, NHK said. A tsunami of up to 60 cm (24 inches) was recorded along the Pacific coast but the tsunami warning was later lifted, NHK said. Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas. The country accounts for about 20 percent of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater. In October 2004, an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 struck the Niigata region in northern Japan, killing 65 people and injuring more than 3,000. That was the deadliest quake since a magnitude 7.3 tremor hit the city of Kobe in 1995, killing more than 6,400. ""It was big enough to wake me but not big enough to push me off the bed. My son and the family rushed down from upstairs and gathered in my room,"" said Miyako Shiraishi, 93, who lives in Shizuoka. ""It was certainly scary, but not so much compared with the Great Kanto earthquake (in 1923 with magnitude of 7.9). At the time my parents had a store in Tokyo and it was disastro"

""I think today we showed again that we are alive and that we are going to give joy to the people,"" Maradona said after Argentina came from a goal down to beat Russia 3-2 in a friendly. ""The truth is that this gives us more encouragement. The team responded when they were a goal down in a stadium full to the brim with Russian fans,"" he told Argentine television after the final whistle. ""The boys played as I asked them to in the team talk, they couldn't forget,"" said Maradona, whose side face Brazil at home in Rosario on September 5 in a key match for their chances of reaching the 2010 finals in South Africa. Maradona and his team have been heavily criticised by Argentine fans following defeats away to Bolivia and Ecuador and a none too convincing home win against Colombia this year. There has been pessimism at home about Argentina's chances of reaching the finals from their current fourth place in the South American group, and with tough matches ahead against Brazil at home and Paraguay and Uruguay away. They also play bottom-placed Peru at home. A top four finish will see Argentina through, while a fifth place finish would give them another chance in a playoff with a team from the CONCACAF region. DREAM SUBSTITUTIONS In friendlies though, Maradona has a 100 percent record, having beaten Scotland, France and Russia away and Panama at home since taking charge in October 2008 when Alfio Basile suddenly quit. He has come under fire for his lack of coaching experience and poor decision-making from the bench and had not wanted the friendly in Moscow, fearing an injury to one or more players would weaken Argentina for the Brazil match. On Wednesday night his substitutions worked like a dream, however, for a team fielding several fringe players and debutants, and Lionel Messi sidelined with a pulled leg muscle. Following Sergio Aguero's brilliant equaliser on the stroke of halftime, Maradona sent on Lisandro Lopez as a substitute for the second half and the striker had the ball in the net within 30 seconds. Less than a quarter of an hour later, midfielder Jesus Datolo came on for his first cap and put Argentina two up with his first touch. ""Of these players, 85 to 88 percent will be with us against Brazil,"" Maradona said. ""We had to show the people who were watching and calculating how we reacted ahead of the Brazil match, and we showed them we can do it."""
en.15.139.203.2009.8.13,Anwar tipped as Pakistan batting coach,"Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com) - Former opener Saeed Anwar is expected to be hired by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) as a batting coach for the national team. A statement released by the PCB said Anwar had been approached by chairman Ijaz Butt and that he had emerged as a prime candidate, according to Cricinfo. ""Chairman PCB today (Thursday) had a discussion with Saeed Anwar regarding utilisation of his services for cricket. The chairman and Saeed Anwar will meet in the coming week to discuss the plan in detail,"" the statement said. Anwar, 40, reportedly offered to assist Pakistan, who have been struggling at the top of the innings recently. Butt hoped Anwar's expertise would help the team. ""I am thankful for Saeed's encouraging response and his offer to assist PCB and Pakistan players. I am sure Saeed will be able to contribute a lot to Pakistan cricket,"" Butt said. As an international player Anwar made his one-day international on New Year's Day 1989, and entered Test cricket two years later. In 55 Tests he scored 4,052 runs at 45.52, including 11 hundreds, but he achieved global fame through his exploits in ODIs. The PCB, in the interim, have appointed Javed Miandad as the batting adviser to the national team in preparation for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy. Pakistan collapsed thrice in the first two Tests to lose the series against Sri Lanka and Miandad's guidance, the board believes, will help the team address the problem. ""We have requested Miandad help our team's batting before next month's Champions Trophy in South Africa and take care of (the team's) problems,"" Butt said at a press conference.

Survivors and opposition parties say efforts to rescue people stranded in towns and villages have been sluggish. Some villagers were seen shouting at Ma as he toured devastated areas this week. Ma gave his estimate of the death toll, a jump from previous figures of just over 100, at a national security meeting, a presidential aide said. Officials said about 300 may have died in a mudslide that leveled most of Hsiao Lin village in the south. Increased pressure on Ma, who has improved ties with Beijing since taking power more than a year ago, could drain support for his Nationalist Party (KMT) in local elections in December. ""As one of the victims said the other day, 'I voted for you, but now I can't even reach you',"" said Lin Chong-pin, strategic studies professor at Tamkang University in Taipei. ""So there's a big drop in satisfaction with his performance."" Some are also calling for Ma to reshuffle his cabinet and may think long-term that he ""doesn't care,"" said Hsu Yung-ming, a political science professor at Soochow University in Taipei. CREWS OPEN ROAD TO STRICKEN AREA After days of dispatching helicopters to rescue survivors and distribute food in Hsiao Lin, authorities opened a road into the stricken district on Thursday. But it was now unlikely that anyone trapped since Monday in the landslide had survived. ""The county magistrate gave the premier a report that in his judgment about 300 were dead,"" a Government Information Office section chief said. ""These are the conditions now. Specific numbers will depend on the army opening the road and sending people in."" Morakot has caused about T$30 billion ($910 million) in losses to agriculture and infrastructure and reconstruction is expected to cost about T$120 billion. The government spent about the same amount after a 1999 earthquake that killed 2,400 people. The typhoon has knocked out 34 bridges and severed 253 segments of road in Taiwan, with repairs expected to take up to three years in the worst spots, the transportation ministry said. In Cishan, a storm-ravaged town of 41,000, both road bridges had collapsed, smashing houses and taking down cars. Residents jammed a footbridge which remained standing. Army crews used earth movers to clear mud from roads as hundreds of people cleaned homes or storefronts, heaving out water-logged possessions. ""My store has been closed for days because I figured no one could get to it,"" said Chen Chih-lu, who owns a furniture shop in Cishan. ""My guess is 90 percent of us are digging out of the mud."" Outside Cishan, swathes of banana trees lay flat in the mud, testimony to agricultural losses totaling T$10 billion. Food prices soared by up to 50 percent and some staples were in short supply. The government will spend T$3 billion to help farmers recover in the coming weeks, a council of agriculture official s"

China believes the world should work towards a global treaty banning the use of weapons in outer space and aim for a complete ban on nuclear weapons, Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said. ""It is important to resolve proliferation issues through political and diplomatic means and eradicate the root causes of nuclear weapon proliferation,"" he said in a speech to the U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Yang said Beijing was ready to work with others to promote the denuclearisation of the divided Korean peninsula and settle Iran's nuclear issue ""with a view to safeguarding the international non-proliferation regime and maintaining regional peace and stability."" The International Atomic Energy Agency has failed to get Iran to allow broader surveillance of its uranium enrichment plant to ensure no materials are diverted for weapons purposes, diplomats say. US President Barack Obama has given Iran until September to take up a six-power offer of talks on trade benefits if it shelves enrichment, or face harsher sanctions. The UN Security Council expanded an arms embargo on North Korea after Pyongyang's second nuclear test in May. The 65-nation conference is the world's only multilateral disarmament forum but has failed to agree any pacts since global treaties banning chemical weapons and underground nuclear tests in the 1990s. Its members include the five official nuclear weapon powers -- China, Britain, France, Russia and the United States -- as well as nuclear-capable India and Pakistan, and Israel, widely believed to have the Middle East's only nuclear arms. NEW PAGE Pakistan is blocking a relaunch of talks on curbing production of nuclear weapons, diplomats said on Monday. Yang noted the conference had experienced a long period of stagnation, but did not refer to Pakistan directly. ""His speech sends an important signal,"" China's disarmament ambassador Wang Qun told Reuters. ""We will work in a constructive way."" Yang called on the conference to launch negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty to halt the production of material used to make nuclear weapons. He welcomed talks between Russia and the United States to make further cuts in their nuclear weapons. China believed the peaceful use of nuclear energy should be encouraged as part of efforts to ban nuclear weapons, he said. Non-proliferation should not be used as an argument to interfere with the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy of countries signing up to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which formalises the restriction of nuclear weapons to the five official nuclear powers, he said. Yang also said: ""Credible and effective multilateral measures must be taken to forestall the weaponisation and arms race in outer sp"

Aspiring spaceship operators will have 45 days to submit proposals, which will be competitively evaluated. Awards for the Commercial Crew Development program are expected to be announced before the end of September. The United States is retiring its fleet of space shuttles next year after seven more missions to complete construction of the $100 billion International Space Station, which orbits about 225 miles above Earth. After that, the United States plans to buy rides for astronauts to and from the station from Russia, one of the 16 nations involved in the station program. NASA is spending $500 million to help two U.S. firms, Space Exploration Technologies, a privately held company known as SpaceX, and Orbital Sciences Corp, develop rockets and capsules to deliver cargo to the station. SpaceX's contract includes an option to upgrade its Dragon cargo ship for passenger service. The company has said it needs $300 million, most of which would be used to develop a launch escape system for the crew. ""It's a little disappointing that (the new program) is only $50 million,"" SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk told Reuters. ""Fifty million is what it costs for one seat on the (Russian) Soyuz."" Nevertheless Musk hailed the move as a step in the right direction. ""The main thing that the public should be taking note of is that right now we are (solely dependent) on the Russians (for space transports) after 2010,"" he said. The White House has convened a panel, headed by former Lockheed Martin chief Norm Augustine, to review NASA's human space program. The current plan is to finish the station next year, retire the shuttles and develop new vehicles that can travel to the space station as well as to the moon and other destinations in the solar system. Funding for the follow-on program has been scaled back to $81.5 billion from $108 billion between 2010 and 2020, the year pegged for the first post-Apollo moon landing. Members of a presidential panel reviewing the country's human space program said last week that given current budget forecasts and no changes in the program, a moon landing would not occur until the mid 2020s at the earliest. The panel, which is scheduled to make its report by August 31, also has been mulling extending the life of the space station beyond its projected shut-down date of 2015. In addition to scientific uses, having a station in orbit will serve as a market to stimulate commercial space development, said board member Jeff Greason, the co-founder and head of XCOR Aerospace. NASA plans to hold a workshop in Houston on Thursday for companies interested in partnering to develop commercial passenger service to space. Firms expressing interest in the program include Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp., Airborne Systems, SpaceX, Boeing Co, Tether Applications, Retro Aerospace, Emergent Space Technologies, Davidson Technologies, and Paragon Space Development Corp.

en.15.139.285.2009.8.10,Zimbabwe's Mugabe says may reconsider ties with West,"HARARE, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe said on Monday the country's unity government may need to reconsider its relations with Western nations he accused of refusing to support the new administration. Mugabe formed the government in February with rival Morgan Tsvangirai, now prime minister, but Western countries have continued to withhold funding, saying the veteran leader has not shown commitment to fully implement the unity deal. The West has maintained travel and financial bans on Mugabe and his allies and refuses to extend financial support to the government until it undertakes political and economic reforms. Mugabe, 85, in power since independence from Britain in 1980, said although the unity government was the result of efforts by the African Union and the regional Southern African Development Community, the West still refused to support it. ""I say these are not the people to deal with. If they reject us, why should we continue to want their help,"" Mugabe told thousands of mourners at the burial of deputy president Joseph Msika in Harare. ""So we must assert ourselves as the inclusive government and say we have tried to open ourselves as friends, but you (the West) are not coming as friends, you want to come as masters to us, as principals to tell us what to do."" Mugabe's position is at odds the drive by his coalition partner Tsvangirai to restore full ties with Western governments that are crucial to providing financial aid for the unity government to fix the country's battered economy. Although the government has reported securing about $2 billion in credit lines for the private sector, mostly from Africa, it has failed to attract budgetary support and significant foreign investment. Tsvangirai toured Europe and the United States in June, but his efforts to attract Western financial aid for the unity government, which needs $8.3 billion for reconstruction, were met with calls for more reform. Mugabe accuses the West of imposing sanctions on Zimbabwe as punishment for seizing white-owned commercial farms to resettle blacks and to loosen his grip on power. The veteran president said on Monday the farms would not be returned to white farmers, adding that foreign aid was not enough to develop the country. He said former colonizer Britain wanted to maintain influence in the once prosperous southern African nation. ""Let everyone in the inclusive government and in the country generally know that our nation will never prosper through foreign handouts,"" said Mugabe. ""We are not a poor country, our history would not have been this troubled if we had been a poor country."""
en.15.139.114.2009.8.13,"HRW urges Israel to probe Gaza ""white flag"" deaths","JERUSALEM Aug 13(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Human Rights Watch called on Israel on Thursday to investigate seven incidents in which it said Israeli troops shot dead Palestinian civilians who were flying white flags during the war in the Gaza Strip in January. Expressing disappointment with Israel's response so far to a range of allegations of war crimes made by international bodies, the New York-based lobby group said governments should press for prosecutions under international law if the Jewish state and its enemies in Gaza's Islamist authorities did not act themselves. In the latest report from various organizations to catalog accusations of possible war crimes by both sides in three weeks of fighting, Human Rights Watch said it had statements and other evidence indicating 11 unarmed people including five women and four children were shot dead while in groups waving white flags. ""These casualties comprise a small fraction of the Palestinian civilians wounded and killed,"" Human Rights Watch said. ""But they stand out because, in each case, the victims were standing, walking or in slowly moving vehicles with other unarmed civilians, and were trying to convey their non-combatant status by waving a white flag."" ""All available evidence indicates that Israeli forces were in control of the areas in question, no fighting was taking place there at the time, and no Palestinian forces were hiding among the civilians or using them as human shields."" A Gaza observer group put civilian deaths at more than 900 out of more than 1,400 Palestinians it said were killed, while Israel said just under 300 civilians and some 900 fighters were killed. Thirteen Israelis, 10 soldiers and three civilians, died. Israel has rejected international criticism of an offensive it said was launched to curb rocket attacks on its towns by Hamas in Gaza. It says it is investigating allegations but has not yet found cause to prosecute any of its soldiers. Human Rights Watch, which said it had received no reply to detailed questions it sent the army, gave an account of an allegation that on January 7 a soldier shot dead two children. ""Two women and three children ... were standing in front of their home after an Israeli soldier ordered them outside -- at least three of them holding pieces of white cloth -- when a soldier near a tank opened fire, killing two girls, ages 2 and 7, and wounding the third girl and their grandmother,"" it s"

Half a million people in coastal Fujian province were moved to safer parts ahead of the typhoon's arrival, along with a similar number in neighbouring Zhejiang, Xinhua reported. Up the coast, Shanghai was on ""high alert"" and dozens of cargo ships in the area delayed or cancelled voyages. China's National Meteorological Centre said ""violent rainstorms"" could strike swathes of eastern China on Sunday and into Monday. Winds of up to 120 kph (75 mph) destroyed five houses in Wenzhou, a manufacturing hub on the coast of Zhejiang, the official news agency said. ""Four adults and a four-year-old boy were buried in debris and the child died during the afternoon after emergency treatment failed,"" Xinhua said, citing city officials. The typhoon had swept across Taiwan, the self-ruled island off the Chinese coast, killing three people, and 27 were missing, Taiwanese disaster response officials said on Sunday. A hotel in Taiwan collapsed into a swollen river after guests and staff had been evacuated. The winds were set to weaken as the typhoon crossed the Chinese mainland but business, fishing and shipping across the export-driven eastern region was likely to be badly disrupted. Many flights across the region were cancelled. At least one cargo ship was beached by the winds and waves.

""The room shook for around 20 to 30 seconds, it was quite strong,"" said Reuters correspondent Sanjit Kumar Roy in Port Blair, capital of the islands. He said that in the northern part of Andaman Island, people ran out of their houses in panic. Police said there had been no reports so far of any damage. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake, initially reported as a magnitude 7.7, struck at 1:55 a.m. (1955 GMT on Monday). It was shallow, at a depth of 20.6 miles, and was centered 160 miles north of Port Blair. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami watch for the region. ""Earthquakes of this size have the potential to generate a destructive local tsunami and sometimes a destructive regional tsunami along coasts located usually no more than a thousand kilometers (about 600 miles) from the earthquake epicenter,"" the tsunami center said in its bulletin. However, an official at the Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services said a tsunami warning had not been issued by his department. ""We have not issued a tsunami alert and are monitoring the water level changes in the region at the moment,"" Ajay Kumar told Reuters by phone. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a chain of small islands hundreds of miles east of India in the Indian Ocean. A 7.6 magnitude quake is classified by the USGS as a major earthquake and is capable of widespread, heavy damage. An even bigger quake in the Indian Ocean in 2004 caused a tsunami that killed some 228,000 people. In Indonesia, a meteorology agency official said his agency was monitoring the Aceh area on the tip of Sumatra. So far there had been no reports of a tsunami in Indonesia but it could take two hours for one to reach the coastline"

en.15.139.120.2009.8.10,"Venezuela, Colombia tensions high ahead of summit","CARACAS, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Sunday raised tensions with Colombia over a US troop plan, accusing his neighbor of sending an army patrol over their Orinoco River border and ending a Colombian gasoline subsidy. Chavez made his remarks on the eve of a regional summit in Ecuador, where the persistent Washington critic will try to fuel opposition to a Colombian plan to allow US troops more access to seven of its military bases. Colombia denied Chavez's charge of a military incursion after the defense ministry consulted with commanders in the border area. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, a staunch US ally, says the troop plan is necessary to fight drug traffickers. But Chavez claims a greater US presence in the region is a direct threat to him and risks sparking war in South America. His comments may be aimed at increasing pressure on Uribe ahead of the Quito meeting and came just hours after Colombian forces captured 11 Ecuadorean troops who had crossed over another border but were quickly sent back. Chavez, a former paratrooper, often claims the United States wants to provoke war between Colombia and Venezuela to win access to the OPEC nation's huge oil reserves. Speaking on his weekly television show, Chavez said he had been informed Colombian soldiers crossed the Orinoco River border in a small boat although he said the vessel had gone by the time Venezuelan troops arrived to check. ""This is a provocation by the government of Uribe, that's the Yankees there, the Yankees have started to command Colombian military forces,"" said Chavez, who often uses incendiary words against Colombia but then backs down. Earlier on Sunday, Colombian soldiers handed over an Ecuadorean army patrol, which had crossed 300 yards (meters) into the Putumayo region, which borders Ecuador. The leftist governments of Venezuela and Ecuador often have thorny relations with Colombia, especially since a Colombian bombing raid on a guerrilla camp in Ecuador last year. Leaders from across Latin America meet in Ecuador on Monday for the inauguration of President Rafael Correa's second term followed by a summit to discuss regional integration where the base plan is expected to top the agenda along with complaints of a flawed U.S. response to a recent coup in Honduras. Conservative Uribe is not attending, but he toured the region to drum up support for the planned increase in U.S. troops. Brazil, Chile and Peru say it is a sovereign matter, but Colombia's socialist Andean neighbors are furious. GAS SMUGGLERS Chavez has already taken measures against Colombia's state oil company and car exporters, and on Sunday ordered the end of a deal to sell subsidized gasoline in border regions. ""Stop the supply of (subsidized) fuel to Colombia right now, let them buy it at its real price. How can we favor the government of Uribe like this?"" He also urged companies to buy less from a trade partner with which the oil producer last year shared $7 billion of commerce. Venezuela exports oil and chemical products to Colombia in exchange for food and textiles. Under a 2008 agreement, Venezuela sells between 50,000 and 120,000 barrels of subsidized gasoline each month to Colombia to combat rampant fuel smuggling. Venezuela has some of the world's cheapest gasoline, which costs just a few US cents to fill a large tank and makes contraband sales to more costly Colombia big business. Chavez withdrew his ambassador from Bogota for about a week in the diplomatic spat but late on Friday ordered him back. Colombia, the world's No. 1 cocaine producer, has received more than $5 billion in mostly military aid from Washington to fight drug traffickers and FARC rebels. The base deal is an extension of an existing military cooperation accord. US President Barack Obama on Friday denied the United States is planning to set up military bases in Colombia as part of the upgraded security agreement and said he has no intention of sending large numbers of additional troops. The United States is in talks with Uribe's government about relocating US drug interdiction flight operations to Colombia after being kicked out of neighboring Ecuador. The plan is expected to increase the number of US troops in Colombia above the current total of less than 300 but not above 800, the maximum permitted under the existing military pact, officials s"
en.15.139.372.2009.8.10,Israel summons US envoy over settlement dispute,"JERUSALEM, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel summoned one of its diplomats from the United States on Sunday after he circulated a memorandum accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government of doing ""strategic damage"" to ties with Washington. Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said a disciplinary measure was being taken with the Israeli consul in Boston, Nadav Tamir, after publication last week of his ""very regrettable"" memorandum. Tamir's criticism appeared in a brief intended for internal circulation and was leaked in a Thursday newscast by Israel's Channel 10 television, which quoted him as saying differences with Washington over Jewish settlements had hurt relations. The settlement issue has opened a rift between Israel and its main ally, with Netanyahu resisting President Barack Obama's calls to freeze the expansion of enclaves Israel has built in territory it captured in a 1967 war. Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said that peace negotiations, stalled since December, cannot resume until settlement activity ceases in the occupied West Bank. Tamir wrote that Israel's handling of the dispute was ""doing strategic damage"" to its ties with Washington and had given Israel a negative opinion rating in the United States, similar to those of Iran and North Korea. Ayalon said any friction with Washington had declined in the past several months, with frequent contacts between Obama's Middle East envoy George Mitchell, who has been holding talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders to resume negotiations. Taking the rare step of dressing down a diplomat publicly, Ayalon told Army Radio no decision had been made as to whether Tamir should be dismissed. Ayalon said Tamir's document was ""not the work of a professional,"" contained more opinion than data. He called Boston, a liberal bastion, a ""bubble,"" unrepresentative of other U.S. regions where Ayalon insisted support for Israel had grown. NETANYAHU: WE WON'T REPEAT GAZA ERROR Netanyahu, who has said he wouldn't build additional settlements but wants to continue construction in existing enclaves to accommodate what he calls natural growth, said Sunday he would not remove any settlements before a peace deal. Remarking on the fourth anniversary since a Gaza pullout when Israel removed some 9,000 Jewish settlers and soldiers from the Gaza Strip and northern West Bank, Netanyahu told cabinet ministers ""we will not repeat this mistake."" Netanyahu said Israel's withdrawal from coastal Gaza had not brought about peace and led ultimately to Iranian-backed Hamas Islamists who reject Israel's existence, to seize control. Israel has kept up an economic blockade of the coastal territory since shortly after the withdrawal, following Hamas' rise to power after a 2006 election. Palestinians say the policy creates hardship for many of the 1.5 million who live in Gaza. Some 500,000 Israelis live in the settlements built in occupied territory that is home to some 3 million Palestinians. The World Court has ruled that the settlements are illegal. Israel disputes t"
en.15.139.143.2009.8.14,Pakistan allows politics in militant-infested areas,"ISLAMABAD, Aug 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani President Asif Zardari lifted on Friday a ban on political activity in the ethnic Pashtun tribal belt on the Afghan border in an apparent move to loosen the grip of militants on the lawless area. Pakistan's seven tribal regions, known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), are semi-autonomous and have never been fully integrated into the country's administrative and political system. The FATA is a major sanctuary for al Qaeda and the Taliban plotting violence in Pakistan, Afghanistan and beyond and analysts have long argued for it to be fully integrated with the rest of Pakistan and brought under government writ. Zardari, speaking at a ceremony to mark the anniversary of Pakistan's independence from Britain in 1947, said Pashtun tribesmen deserved to be treated the same as other Pakistanis. ""We have allowed political activities in FATA from today,"" Zardari said. The FATA is governed under a system inherited from British colonialists with a government-appointed political agent ruling through the tribes, which observe their centuries-old codes, not Pakistani laws. Political parties have not been allowed to operate in the FATA which analysts say helped to create a vacuum for hardline Muslim clerics to exploit. ""We don't think they should have a different identity. We think whoever has Pakistani citizenship, all Pakistani laws should apply,"" Zardari said. Nuclear-armed Pakistan's efforts to suppress militants on its side of the border are vital for a US-led bid to stabilise Afghanistan, where Taliban have threatened to disrupt an Aug. 20 presidential election. Zardari said a ""handful of terrorists"" had tried to impose their writ on Pakistan but the military had foiled their designs. The military has in recent weeks driven militants from the Swat valley, in North West Frontier Province, and has been attacking Taliban in several parts of FATA including South Waziristan. In a major blow to the militants, Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of Pakistani Taliban and an al Qaeda cohort, was believed to have been killed in a missile strike by a CIA-operated drone in South Waziristan last week. Pakistani and US officials are almost certain that Mehsud, blamed for a wave of bomb attacks across Pakistan, including one that killed Zardari's wife, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007, has been killed though his aides insist he is alive. The US special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, said this week there were signs of disarray within the Pakistani Taliban following the apparent death of Meh"

At a dialogue on budget implementation, Muhith also said three major investment plans for energy, water-resources and ICT were high on the government's agenda. Touching on the major concerns of the government, he said uncertainty of power and energy ""topped the list"". Muhith was addressing a discussion on 'Implementation Challenges of the National Budget FY 2009-10', organised by private research body, Centre for Policy Dialogue, at the city's CIRDAP auditorium. He said the greatest task if implementing the budget was inspiring people in the administration, and tuning up administrative capability. ""We are a little handicapped also when it comes to local government issues."" He said other issues to address included the proportion of investment in the budget's newly introduced PPP (public-private partnership) initiatives. CPD fellow Debapriya Bhattacharya, in a presentation, said bottlenecks, like energy constraints, administrative barriers, land acquisition issue, law and order situation and effects of the global recession, would put pressure on implementing the budget. ""To overcome these, steps should be taken to increase investment in the country."" Former finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said the budget's 6 percent growth target and implementation of a massive Tk 30,500 crore ADP would be ""impossible"" to achieve. He also came down hard on bureaucrats, saying: ""Either they say what you want to hear or shift responsibilities to others."" On the critical issue of land acquisition for public projects, Mirza Aziz said there was lack of advance preparation from the ministries on the matter. ""This should be considered prior to preparing a project not after finalising it."" He also said that 'recession funds' allocated for the budget's stimulus package under would be misused unless the government clarifies the objectives of the funds. CPD chairman Rehman Sobhan, in his concluding note, emphasizsd the role of media in implementing various projects of the government. ""The media should do investigative reports on the development of various projects."" He called on the media to obtain a list of development projects from the finance ministry and report on them on a regular basis. This would create a way for public accountability, said Sobhan."

Pakistan, who lost the Test series 2-0 and the one-day series 3-2, dominated the match with skipper Shahid Afridi guiding his team to a competitive 172 for five in 20 overs. Sri Lanka, cheered on by capacity crowd, stayed in contention until skipper Kumar Sangakkara was bowled by off spinner Saeed Ajmal for 38 from 31 balls. The fall of Sangakkara triggered a middle-order collapse as the run rate rocketed, the hosts losing four wickets for 15 runs before being bowled out for 120 in 18.1 overs. Ajmal was the pick of the Pakistan bowlers, claiming three for 18 from his four overs. Fast bowler Naved ul Hasan also shone for the world Twenty20 champions, taking three for 19 from his 3.1 overs.

Karpal Singh, chairman of the Democratic Action Party (DAP), is being tried for comments he made in February, where he said the Sultan of northern Perak state could be taken to court over endorsing the government takeover of an opposition-ruled state. The trial comes as Prime Minister Najib Razak's newfound popularity is under threat following recent action against opposition members and bloggers under colonial era sedition laws in this Southeast Asian country of 27 million people. Najib has pledged to open up the economy, but harsh measures have been taken against protesters and 600 people were arrested in a recent anti-government rally while the government hurriedly shelved plans for an Internet filter. Karpal, an MP, faces a fine and up to three years in prison if convicted. He told reporters he had ""no doubt"" the case against him was politically motivated. ""A lot of statements from BN (National Front coalition) leaders including the prime minister who has said action should be taken against bloggers who put up seditious material ... I think that appears to be the trend,"" said Karpal. Malaysia's police chief on Wednesday was reported by the Berita Harian Malay language newspaper as saying that two other DAP MPs are to be investigated for sedition. The state government of Perak will also pursue action against two bloggers who it says made comments that insulted the royal family of Perak, which the Perak chief minister said amounted to ""sedition and probably treason"", the New Straits Times reported on Wednesday. Jeffrey Miles from the International Association of Lawyers, one of four observers representing various international legal bodies, said sedition laws have been ""very rarely"" applied in other Commonwealth countries.

The 10,000-strong US Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) in Helmand is the biggest element of a wave of reinforcements sent this year by President Barack Obama in an effort to turn the tide in an eight-year-old war commanders have described as stalemated. The 400 Marines, accompanied by 100 Afghan soldiers, staged Operation Eastern Resolve II in Nawzad, a district in the north-eastern part of the province, the MEB said in a statement. Operations on that scale take place in Afghanistan regularly. ""Our mission is to support the Independent Election Commission and Afghan national security forces. They are the ones in charge of these elections. Our job is to make sure they have the security to do their job,"" MEB commander Brigadier General Larry Nicholson said. The statement gave no details about casualties. Taliban militants have vowed to disrupt the Aug 20 election with attacks on polling stations and threats against voters. The United Nations says intimidation and violence, especially in areas like Helmand, has already disrupted preparations for the vote and campaigning, and could prevent many Afghans from reaching the polls. Helmand has been the focus of US and NATO effort since US and British forces launched the biggest operations of the eight-year-old war last month. By far Afghanistan's most violent province, it produces the bulk of the world's opium poppy crop. US commanders say about half of the province was in the grip of the Taliban until the Marines arrived, with 4,000 of them advancing into the southern part of the province in operation Strike of the Sword, last month. Thousands of British troops, who occupy other parts of Helmand province, launched their own operation Panther's Claw north of the provincial capital Lashkar Gah, facing the heaviest British ground combat casualties in a generation. The period since the beginning of July has been by far the deadliest of the war for US, British and allied troops. More than 100 have now died since the beginning of July. More Western troops have died since the start of March in Afghanistan than in the entire period from 2001-2"

""Based on parliament's investigations, detainees have not been raped or sexually abused in Iran's Kahrizak and Evin prisons. Such claims are totally baseless,"" Iran's state television quoted Ali Larijani as saying. Defeated moderate candidate Mehdi Karoubi said Sunday some protesters, both men and women, had been raped in prison. Many of the post-election detainees were held in south Tehran's Kahrizak prison, built to house people breaching vice laws. At least three people died in custody there and widespread anger erupted as reports of abuse in jail spread. Last month Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the closure of the ""sub-standard"" detention center at Kahrizak. Iranian authorities have acknowledged some protesters were tortured at Kahrizak and said its director had been jailed. Karoubi said he had written 10 days earlier to Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who heads a powerful arbitration body, asking for an inquiry, but had received no response. A committee set up by Karoubi and another defeated candidate Mirhossein Mousavi to pursue the issue submitted a list of 69 people killed in protests to parliament Monday.

With Nadal leading 4-3 in the opening set and having just broken his opponent for the second time, Ferrer calmly walked over to the chair umpire and said he could not continue after aggravating a left knee injury. Ferrer had shown no signs of distress and in fact had dominated stretches of the match. ""I had problems with my knee, I cannot play,"" Ferrer told reporters. ""I've had the problem since before Wimbledon and I want to take some treatment. ""I don't think (the injury is serious), I think next week I will play."" Sidelined for more than two months with tendonitis in both knees, Nadal was playing his first competitive singles match since being knocked out in the fourth round of the French Open in May. Ferrer's retirement puts Nadal into the third round, where he will face Philipp Petzschner of Germany."

Services were expected to be restored by 6pm, said Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company's managing director Monwar Hossain. Hossain told bdnews24.com that the submarine cable link was cut at around 2.45am between Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. ""Repair work is going on. We are expecting the link to be fully restored with the next one and a half to two hours,"" Hossain said at 3.30pm. He said roadworks on the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar highway had caused the accidental cut in the optical fibre link. Bangladesh had already been experiencing slow internet speeds over the past few days, after Typhoon Morakot damaged submarine cables in East Asia earlier in the week, a senior telecoms official said on Thursday. Taiwan, Hong Kong, Philippines and Singapore were facing trouble because of the damage to the Asia Pacific Cable Network-2 (APCN-2), BTCL managing director Khabiruzzaman told bdnews24.com. Reuters also reported that up to 90 percent of all voice call and Internet services from parts of East Asia were disrupted after the typhoon damaged the undersea cables. Khabiruzzaman had said APCN-2 was being repaired in East Asia and net speeds would be restored by Friday. But Bangladesh subsequently experienced the further disruption with the break in its own optical fibre link connecting to the SE-ME-WE-4 submarine cable."

Brazilian midfielder Matuzalem opened the scoring against the run of play in the 61st minute and Inter had barely recovered from the shock before Lazio skipper Tommaso Rocchi chipped keeper Julio Cesar to double the lead. Inter piled on the pressure and new signing Samuel Eto'o cut the deficit with 15 minutes to go but Lazio held on to win the traditional pre-season contest for the third time. ""Getting such an important result against an important team like Inter of course makes me very happy,"" said new Lazio manager Davide Ballardini. ""Inter are probably better than us but we won the match and we deserved it. To beat Inter you have to be good and a bit lucky ... I think we deserved it because we really wanted to win."" Inter manager Jose Mourinho disagreed. ""I am completely satisfied with the way my team played even though I'm disappointed with the result,"" said Mourinho. ""I don't remember Inter playing such good football ... Even after we went 2-0 down, we were still fantastic. ""Only a hypocrite would say Lazio deserved the result,"" he added. FOUR SIGNINGS Mourinho started all four of his new signings, pairing Eto'o and Diego Milito up front with Thiago Motta anchoring midfield and Lucio in central defence. Eto'o and Milito looked lively in attack but it was Brazilian Lucio who came closest to scoring for Inter in the first half with a low close-range header from Esteban Cambiasso's corner palmed away by Fernando Muslera 10 minutes before halftime. Dejan Stankovic, Muntari, Eto'o and Milito all had early chances as Inter looked to take control after the break but it was Lazio who made the breakthrough. Matuzalem found himself free in the area after a 61st-minute Rocchi free kick spun off the wall and he forced the ball into the net with his chin when his first attempt was blocked by Cesar. The celebrations had barely ended when skipper Rocchi doubled the lead with a sublime chip that left Cesar with no chance two minutes later. Inter rallied and camped inside the Lazio half, finally allowing Eto'o space to score his first goal for his new club, the Cameroon international lashing the ball into the roof of the net in the 75th minute after a defensive error. Argentine Milito thought he had equalised 10 minutes later but the referee called him back for offside and, with Muslera outstanding in the Lazio goal, the Cup winners held out for a morale-boosting victory.

Arif Hassan's lawyer, Aminul Goni Tito, said it was the first bail to be granted to any of the accused in the Aug 21 grenade attack cases. Speedy trial tribunal judge Md Masder Hossain granted them bail on Wednesday and ordered the two to appear before their respective jails in their hometowns within one week. Arif Hassan is shown arrested in five other cases, his lawyer said. ""Of the seven cases, he has secured bail in four cases so far,"" said Aminul. Mofizur Rahman's lawyer, Lutfor Rahman Sheikh, told bdnews24.com that there were also other cases against his client. At least 23 people were killed and scores of people were injured, including the then opposition leader Sheikh Hasina, in the deadly grenade attack on an AL rally on Bangabandhu Avenue. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including BNP leader Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu, his brother, also the alleged grenade supplier, Maolana Tajuddin, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkatul Jihad. Of them, 13 accused including Pintu and Hannan are now behind bars while the remaining accused are on the run. The court on Aug 3 asked ordered further investigation into the 2004 grenade attack on a petition by state prosecutors.

en.15.139.490.2009.8.11,Secrets of Churchill and his War Cabinet to be revealed in London exhibition,"By Syed Nahas Pasha London, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)An exhibition marking the 70th anniversary of the start of the Second World War opens at the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms in central London at the end of this month. ""Undercover: Life in Churchill's Bunker"" will showcase the stories of those who worked underground in secret alongside Churchill and his War Cabinet, drawing on new personal accounts to build a picture of daily life beneath the London streets, where events of the war were being shaped and world-changing decisions made. The exhibition, running for a year from August 27, will present historic images, previously unseen personal objects and the voices of War Room veterans, combining to create the tense but often humorous atmosphere in the series of underground rooms selected as the secret war headquarters for Churchill and his War Cabinet. The Cabinet War Rooms were created in 1938, as the underground storage areas of the Office of Works Building in Whitehall were converted to house the central core of government and to become a military information centre, serving the Prime Minister and the Chiefs of Staff of the air, naval and land forces. Intended as a temporary site, the rooms became operational on 27 August 1939, a week before the German invasion of Poland and Britain's declaration of war. This 'temporary' but timely measure served as the central shelter for government and military strategists for the next six years. Undercover begins with the days before the outbreak of war when the Cabinet was looking for a site for the War rooms, stretching forward to the 1980s when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher approved the plan to open the Rooms to the public and offering an insight into what it is like to work there today. It examines the safety and security of the Rooms and their ability to withstand a bomb blast, showing how Churchill operated, how people worked with him, and revealing how everybody coped with a daily underground existence. It also explores the emotions experienced by the group of workers once war was won and the bunker closed. Among the objects on display are a previously unseen letter registering Churchill's complaint that the War Rooms were not 'bomb proof' and that he felt that the War Cabinet had 'sold him a pup'; previously unseen wooden door signs, including one for Churchill's bedroom; staff passes demonstrating the levels of security in place; an original sun lamp box, used to give underground workers compulsory sun treatment; a spoof memo from a secretary urgently requesting stockings and other 'essential supplies'; the text of one of Churchill's major speeches made from the War Rooms, illustrating his famous and very deliberately spelt out oratory technique; never before displayed War Cabinet meeting notes kept by Assistant Secretary Lawrence Burgis against all rules; pencil doodles by Alanbrooke of colleagues during the overseas conferences attended by Cabinet War Rooms staff; and a fascinating, never before displayed letter revealing that the rooms were reused during the Suez Crisis. While the personality of Churchill looms large throughout, many uncelebrated characters are also brought to the fore, many of them secretaries or typists leading seemingly ordinary lives but involved in an extraordinary event. Muriel Cooper, who worked in the Key Points Intelligence Branch in the War Rooms from 1939-1944 recalls that ""Churchill would say 'Don't take anything seriously, it's nothing personal'. There would be huge tension in his presence, but he always apologised for being brisk. I was so proud of the fact that I was able to serve even as a minor secretary to such a great man."" Wendy Wallace: ""You felt safedidn't even know the raid was on but one bomb would have knocked us to smithereens"" Typist Myra Cooper: ""We hated war, all of us did, but it made us grow up, it was our university."" Cyril Rider, a despatch rider who delivered messages from the Cabinet war Rooms to Chequers: ""It was important that no one go their hands on (the messages), they'd got to be delivered directly. I came to respect Churchill and the other blokes there."" Elizabeth Norman of the Intelligence Section remembers: ""After the first few weeks I always slept in my own bed and let fate take control. Somehow under very bad conditions we remained remarkably healthy on very little and very poor food, living and working deep underground by artificial light and no chance of real exercise."" Ray Smith, a clerk for the Joint Planning Committee, remembers sleeping  but only when he had to  in the Dock: ""It was filled with lots of iron beds, no air circulation at that level at all, very claustrophobic and not very conducive to a good night's sleep. One would wake up with a mouth like the bottom of a bird cage, and very few people chose to sleep there because it was so claustrophobic and unpleasant."" Phil Reed, Director of the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, said ""We are particularly pleased to be able to present the memories of the people who spent years of their life in the War Rooms."" ""The juxtaposition of often very ordinary preoccupations in the midst of utmost tension is striking."" ""The camaraderie of co-workers is clear, not to mention the unshakeable importance of glamour among the secretaries and typists."" The subjects of the exhibition are a direct link to Churchill and enjoyed a significant and particular relationship with him, said R"
en.15.139.369.2009.8.13,Iran cleric says obeying Ahmadinejad like obeying God,"TEHRAN, Aug 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A senior Iranian cleric seen as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's spiritual mentor said obeying the head of government was like obeying God, the moderate Etemad-e Melli newspaper said on Thursday. Firebrand cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi believes the authority of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei comes from God, not from the people. Khamenei presides over a complex political and clerical system as vali-ye faqih, or religious jurisprudent, with the president running the day-today governing of the country. ""When a president is endorsed by the vali-ye faqih, obeying the president is like obeying God,"" the daily quoted Mesbah-Yazdi as saying. Khamenei swiftly endorsed Ahmadinejad's re-election after the June 12 presidential vote which was followed by the biggest anti-government protests since the 1979 Islamic revolution. The losing candidates say the poll was rigged, a charge denied by Iran's authorities, including Khamenei, who has accused Western powers of fomenting the vote unrest. Moderates say 69 protesters were killed in the demonstrations, contradicting the official report of 26 deaths. Mesbah-Yazdi has long held that democracy and elections are incompatible with Islam. Ahmadinejad's allies deny the president takes orders from the cleric, who is a defender of the supreme leader's absolute power. ""When a president is ... endorsed by the supreme leader and becomes an agent of the leader, the leader's light is also shed on the president,"" Mesbah-Yazdi said. Mesbah-Yazdi is a member of a popularly elected conservative-dominated panel of 86 Shi'ite Muslim clergymen with the power to elect and dismiss the supreme leader. But despite its powerful mandate, the Assembly of Experts has never sought to oust a leader in the 30 years of the Islamic Republic. Mesbah-Yazdi's followers have great sway among Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards and the Basij volunteer paramilitary force. The Guards political chief Yadollah Javani has called for defeated candidates Mehdi Karoubi and Mirhossein Mousavi as well as moderate former President Mohammad Khatami to be put on trial for inciting election unrest. LEGITIMACY Iran's police and security forces quelled the protests and the judiciary has now begun mass trials of than 100 moderates, despite the damage it might inflict on the government's legitimacy and relations with the West. At least 200 people still remain in jail, including senior moderate politicians, activists, lawyers and journalists. Defeated candidate Karoubi said on Sunday some protesters, both men and women, were raped in prison. The abuse allegations, were rejected by authorities, including by parliament speaker and Tehran's police chief. Many of the detainees were held in south Tehran's Kahrizak prison and at least three people died in custody there and widespread anger erupted as reports of abuse in jail spread. Last month Khamenei ordered the closure of the ""sub-standard"" detention centre at Kahrizak. Iranian authorities have acknowledged some protesters were tortured at Kahrizak and said its director had been jailed. Such allegations have created a rift among hardline politicians, many of whom backed Ahmadinejad's election win. An association of hundreds of former parliamentarians wrote a letter to the Assembly of Experts, urging its head Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to investigate the post election events. Rafsanjani, a former president, is an ally of the defeated moderate candidates. The United States, its European allies and Iranian moderates have denounced the mass trials as a ""sham"". Among those being tried are French teaching assistant Clotilde Reiss and two employees of French and British embassies in Tehran, accused of espionage and taking part in a Western plot, charges France and Britain say are baseless. The father of Reiss said on Thursday he hoped his daughter would leave prison later in the day, after France agreed to provide bail for her conditional release. Iran's display of intolerance of internal opposition has alarmed the West, which had hoped for new talks on what it suspects is an Iranian nuclear arms quest. Tehran denies t"

The United States wanted to try Bout, dubbed the ""Merchant of Death,"" for conspiracy to sell millions of dollars of weapons to rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which it said could be used to kill Americans.

Plain clothes police will also be operating in the city during the event, said Haque, who added that security would be coordinated with the intelligence agencies. He said important sites in the city are being kept under surveillance, and law enforcers had begun checking residential hotels, slum areas and transit hubs for anything out of the ordinary. Police patrols have also been upped and suspicious cars are being stopped and searched, he said. A Dhaka Metropolitan Police statement requested members of the public intending to visit the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhanmandi not to arouse any suspicions by carrying anything unusual.

en.15.139.394.2009.8.10,Remitters seen as 'unsung heroes',"Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh's overseas workers, who remitted a record $9.6 billion or 12 percent of the country's total earnings in the last fiscal year, were termed ""heroes"" on Monday, while the government was urged to properly evaluate the contribution of remittance earners to the economy. ""These valuable remitters and our garments workers are the 'unsung heroes' of the economy,"" Dhaka University economics professor Wahiduddin Mahmud said, speaking as chief guest at the Remittance Utshob and Shonar Manush Shommanona 2009. But, Mahmud said, the lack of detailed data regarding their work abroad, their situation when they return home, utilisation of their remittance and poor regulation signaled that the government still regarded the valuable foreign currency earning sector as an 'informal' one. ""The government only records how many people went abroad for work and the amount of remittance sent back in a year."" He said, ""Proper training and bank facilities should be provided before one leaves for work overseas, and rehabilitation and security for those who return being cheated or because of job loss."" Mahmud also said the remittances, which reached $890 million in July this year alone, should be invested in the country's productive sectors, specifically in agriculture. He asked the families and relatives of the remitters not to spend the money only in buying land and gold ornaments, but also to invest in agriculture and small industries. Mahmud also lauded the performance of banks in increasing remittance transfers in recent years by encouraging overseas workers to send back more earnings. Deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank Ziaul Hassan Siddiqui said, ""The central bank is working to further ease money transfers and has approved joint ventures between small banks and NGOs to deliver remittance to the beneficiaries' door steps."" He also asked BAIRA (Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies) to reduce fees for sending people abroad, as a recent World Bank report criticised the rates as ""too high"". Siddiqui also warned the banks not to engage in competition among themselves in fixing exchange rates, which benefits exchanges abroad but not the remitters or beneficiaries. The Remittance Utshob, or Festival, and Shonar Manush Shommanona (Golden People Awards), was organised by the Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit, at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. Some 13 banks were participating with BAIRA, BMET (Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training) and RMMRU also setting up stalls to deliver remittance related information to visitors. President of RMMRU Dr Tasneem Siddiui in her welcome speech urged the government to properly evaluate remittance earners' contribution to the economy. Top officials of the participating banks also gave speeches and recommendations. A ceremony in the evening will distribute awards in categories for best remitter, remittance utilising family, grassroots bankers, migrant rights protection committees and recruiting agencies. The finance minister, expatriates welfare minister and the Bangladesh Bank governor are expected to attend the awards."

The court sentenced her to three years in prison but that was immediately reduced to 18 months on the orders of the military government, which said she could serve the time in her Yangon home. A guilty verdict had been widely expected in a case critics say was fabricated by the military regime to keep Suu Kyi out of circulation ahead of a general election scheduled for next year.

en.15.139.403.2009.8.10,UN says violence threatens Afghan poll,"KABUL, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Insurgent violence and threats have hurt preparation for Afghanistan's Aug. 20 election and could prevent large numbers of terrified Afghans from voting, the United Nations said on Sunday. ""Insecurity poses a threat to the ability of a significant number of Afghan to exercise their right to vote,"" a UN report, issued less than two weeks before the poll. ""It is not surprising that the fear as well as the covert and overt intimidation that characterises the insurgency, creates an underlying reticence to stand for office and to campaign or to vote,"" the report said. Taliban militants say they plan to disrupt the poll, which US President Barack Obama has identified as the most important test of Afghanistan's political progress this year. Obama has rushed thousands of extra troops to the country to help secure the vote. President Hamid Karzai, who has lined up the backing of many of Afghanistan's powerful regional chiefs, is seen as likely to win re-election against a fractured opposition. But diplomats worry that sustained violence on polling day, threats that sharply reduce turnout or allegations of large-scale fraud could make it hard to present any result as legitimate, and therefore worsen the instability in the country. Violence in Afghanistan has reached its highest levels since the Taliban were driven from power in 2001, especially in the south and east of the country. In the most violent areas, far fewer people are attending political rallies than in the past, for fear of attack, the U.N. report said. In some provinces -- such as Ghazni in the south -- candidates are not campaigning at all, only sending posters. ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS The report identified nine people killed in suspected election-related attacks, including four staff for Karzai's campaign, as well as numerous failed assassination attempts. Insurgents had broadcast threats by radio in two provinces and had distributed pamphlets with threats in two others. It drew particular attention to the risks faced by female candidates and voters. The Taliban and other groups violently oppose women's participation in politics. Female candidates make up 10 percent of those registered to stand for provincial council seats across the country, but some have been subjected to death threats. The house of one was fired on after letters were plastered on buildings warning her to stop campaigning, the report said. In some areas, men may cast votes on women's behalf -- a practice the report said is seen as culturally acceptable in conservative parts of Afghanistan, despite being illegal. Suspiciously large numbers of women's registration cards have been issued in some areas. In one case, the report said, a local official was accused of stealing 9,000 voter registration cards intended for women, ""and to have gone to seven local political allies with the intention of using the cards fraudulently."" The incident, it said, is under investigat"

In her first tournament since April 2007 the Belgian -- who does not even have a world ranking -- dispatched French Open champion and world number six Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-4, 2-6, 6-4. Were that not noteworthy enough, she immediately set her sights on a bigger trophy: world number one Dinara Safina. ""It's going to be tough,"" the 26-year-old mother of one said, smiling at the understatement. ""I mean, she's had very consistent results."" World number six Kuznetsova went the same way as 13th-ranked former Wimbledon runner-up Marion Bartoli and world number 20 Patty Schnyder as Clijsters maintained her outstanding form to reach the quarter-finals. Friday's match with Safina will be another step up, but Clijsters said she felt in the kind of form and shape that will allow her to perform well against the world's top-ranked player. GREAT PLAYER ""I have to say I feel really good,"" Clijsters said after outslugging Kuznetsova in a match where her athleticism and stamina helped her survive the deciding set. ""I don't feel tired or drained or anything. Just a few little aches and pains from getting back into playing matches. Your body adjusts. It's aches and pains but nothing's holding me back from playing well and doing what I want to do. ""There are patches where my level is really good and also there are a few dips. I'm not saying I didn't have that in the past, but that's something ... I would definitely try to stay a little more consistent out there."" Safina said Clijsters seemed to be playing as well as she had been before quitting two years back. ""She's a great player. I think for sure she plays exactly how she did,"" the Russian said. ""You cannot lose your talent. You cannot lose anything. ""If you are a great player, it doesn't matter. Give (Pete) Sampras a racket now and he will play exactly the same. Maybe she will be a little bit slower, but she's still young."" Clijsters won her sole Grand Slam title at the US Open in 2005.

The survivors from four villages made it to higher ground before walls of mud and rock submerged their homes, said Hu Jui-chou, an army official involved in the rescue effort. Among them are about 200 people from Hsiao Lin, a village in Kaohsiung county that was obliterated by a landslide, Hu said. ""They had already left the main village and gone to another one,"" he said, adding that they used satellite phones to locate the villagers. ""We don't need to rescue them. We can just send in food."" Others from the villages of Sanmin, Namahsia and Chinghe were also found safe. But many are still missing, Hu said. Up to 600 were feared buried in the Hsiao Lin mudslide on Monday morning following heavy rains from Typhoon Morakot over the weekend. On Monday and Tuesday, as hundreds of anxious relatives waited at a makeshift search and rescue base, helicopters brought survivors, many injured, back from the villages as slides had blocked the roads. Rescue work will continue on Wednesday. The death toll since Morakot and tropical storm Etau cut a swathe through Asia has climbed to more than 100, including 63 in Taiwan."

A report by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay lambasted the ""nearly total impunity"" for the violations. The already critical human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) deteriorated further during the war, she said in the report, the first of a series of periodic reports ordered by the UN Human Rights Council in January during Israel's ""Operation Cast Lead"". The 34-page report is one of two -- together with a forthcoming one by South African jurist Richard Goldstone who has been conducting hearings in Gaza -- that will be presented to the council next month. ""...significant prima facie evidence indicates that serious violations of international humanitarian law as well as gross human rights violations occurred during the military operations of 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009, which were compounded by the blockade that the population of Gaza endured in the months prior to Operation Cast Lead and which continues,"" Pillay said. Pillay said rights violations included arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment, extrajudicial execution, forced eviction and home demolition, settlement expansion and related violence and restrictions on freedom of movement and expression. ""While these violations are of deep concern in their own right, the nearly total impunity that persists for such violations (regardless of the responsible duty bearer) is of grave concern, and constitutes a root cause for their persistence,"" the former South African high court judge said. Pillay's recommendations included the following: -- Israel should lift the blockade of Gaza and restrictions on movement in and out of the West Bank, which amount to illegal collective punishment. -- Allegations of violations of humanitarian law and human rights during the Gaza war should be investigated by independent bodies, and victims should have the right to reparations. -- Israel should tackle impunity for violations, and curb its use of the military justice system, which does not meet international standards. -- Israel should end the illegal expansion of settlements in the occupied territory, halt evictions and demolitions of Palestinian homes, and end settler violence. Unlike rulings of the UN Security Council, the findings and recommendations of the Human Rights Council are not binding. Islamic and African countries, backed by Russia, China, Cuba and Nicaragua, currently have a majority on the 47-member council, which has spent more time on Israel/Palestine than on any other issue since being set up three years"
en.15.139.397.2009.8.11,Bangabandhu trial not resuming before Aug 15,"Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)Anisul Haq, the chief prosecution counsel, has said the hearing on the appeal by convicts against the High Court judgment in the murder trial of independence hero Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is not taking place before Aug 15. Haq broke the news to the media at a press briefing in his chamber on Tuesday, just two days after law minister Shafique Ahmed had said the appeal hearing was likely to begin before Aug 15, the National Mourning Day. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam had also said last week that documents would be placed with the Appellate Division within a week for resumption of appeal hearings in the Bangabandhu murder trial. Prosecutor Anisul Haq, who is also an additional attorney general, echoed Alam. He said on Tuesday, ""Very soon, in not more than seven working days, the brief of the appeal will be submitted for hearing."" The brief report has highlighted the reasons why the appeal of the defendant should be dismissed. ""It has been prepared. Now research is going on because it is a historic case,"" said Haq. Before the press briefing, he told bdnews24.com that the brief of the appeal would be submitted at the court as soon as Wednesday. Asked whether the hearing will start from Aug 28 before the the Supreme Court goes into vacation, he said the application will be submitted to the court of the chamber judge, meaning it will be filed during vacation. The chief justice will also be urged to form a bench and once that is constituted and the date will be set for hearing. Questioned about the delay since the defendants had submitted the brief of their appeal long ago, Haq said during the hearing of the leave to appeal one of the defendants, AKM Mohiuddin, was deported from the United States to Bangladesh. After more than 2,000 days of the appeal, Mohiuddin appealed for pardon for the delay and added that he did not know that he had been convicted in the case. He came to know about it after he was taken to the jail on arrest at the Zia International Airport, Haque further quoted Mohiuddin as stating in the appeal. ""But on the internet I came to know that Mohiuddin said at the US immigration court that he is a convict in Bangabandhu murder case. The noose is hanging above his head. He was involved in this murder,"" said Haque. ""The court asked for the certified copies from that US court after I said those. I could not present the copy at that time. Recently I have managed to collect the papers from US. ""These have been included in the brief. because of this reason the submission of the brief has been delayed,"" Haq explained. He said an additional paper book has been prepared along with the one for the appeal and it will also be submitted 'soon'. Sheikh Mujib was killed with much of his family by some disgruntled military officers on Aug 15, 1975 and the case was filed 21 years after the assassination that shook the nation to the core and changed the political landscape forever. No-one was allowed to file a case. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the military putsch passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for that trial. Then the president, Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam on October 2, 1996 filed a case with Dhanmondi Police Station against 20 persons. On Nov 8, 1998 Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentence to 15 of the 20 accused persons. Four jailed accused major (retd) Bazlul Huda, lt col (sacked) Syed Faruk Rahman, lt col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and lt col (red) Mohiuddin Ahmed appealed in the High Court against the trial court verdict. On Dec 14, 2000 the High Court gave a split verdict in the case: Justice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentence of 10 accused but Justice ABM Khairul Haque retained death sentence of 15 accused. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentence of 12 accused and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four jailed accused submitted leave to appeal in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Col Majed are absconding. Absconding accused Aziz Pasha died in Zimbabwe. President Zillur Rahman's appointed four new judges to the Appellate Division on July 14 this year, raising the total number of judges to an unprecedented 11 in the highest appeals court that has long been hamstrung by the shortage, and cleared the way for the Bangabandhu murder trial among other to see a conclusion. bdne"
en.15.139.133.2009.8.11,Optimism may do women's hearts good,"NEW YORK, Aug 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters Health) - Women with an optimistic outlook may live longer and be less likely to develop heart disease than women who take a dimmer view of life, according to a study published Monday. Researchers found that among more than 97,000 US women between the ages of 50 and 79, those with generally optimistic dispositions were 14 percent less likely to die over eight years than their pessimistic counterparts. They were also 9 percent less likely to develop coronary heart disease, and 30 percent less likely to die of heart complications. That meant that the one-quarter of women who scored highest in optimism had lower rates of developing heart disease than the one-quarter with the lowest scores (deemed ""pessimists""): 43 cases per 10,000 women, versus 60 cases. They also had fewer deaths over the eight years: 46 per 10,000 women, versus 63 among pessimists. The findings, published in the journal Circulation, add to evidence that personality traits may affect people's long-term health. A number of studies have suggested that people with hostile, angry dispositions face higher risks of heart disease and other health problems. And in this study, women who scored high on a measure of ""cynical hostility"" had higher risks of dying from any cause over eight years. But the apparent effects of optimism and hostility were independent of each other. It's possible that optimism has direct effects that help ward off disease, explained Dr. Hilary A. Tindle, the lead researcher on the study and an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. Personality traits may, for instance, influence the nervous, immune or hormonal systems in ways that affect the risks of a range of health problems. On the other hand, optimists may also lead healthier lifestyles. Tindle and her colleagues found that the most optimistic women were in fact less likely to smoke or to be obese or sedentary; they also had lower rates of high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. When the researchers accounted for those factors, optimism itself was still linked to a lower risk of heart disease or death. However, making such statistical adjustments may underestimate the importance of optimism, Tindle said. ""The optimistic attitude itself may be what's driving some of those lower rates of risk factors,"" she explained. The findings are based on questionnaires given to 97,253 US women taking part in a large government study called the Women's Health Initiative. Optimism was gauged by asking participants whether they agreed with statements such as, ""In unclear times, I usually expect the best,"" and ""If something can go wrong for me, it will."" The measure of cynical hostility included statements such as ""It is safer to trust nobody,"" and ""I have often had to take orders from someone who did not know as much as I did."" So will adopting a sunnier outlook help people live longer? ""This study does not address that,"" Tindle said, noting that they simply observed people, rather than trying to change them from pessimists to optimists to see what would happen. ""But,"" she added, ""logically, we know people can change."" The question then becomes whether this leads to lower disease risks, Tindle said. Studies into that question, she noted, ""are coming down the pi"

India is heavily dependent on the June to September monsoon rains for farm output, to help rural income and to drive economic growth. After the driest June in 83 years, the annual rains have been more than a quarter below below normal this season. ""Monsoon situation is still erratic,"" Mukherjee told reporters. ""One hundred and sixty one districts have been declared drought prone. So far as sowing is concerned, 20 percent would be down,"" he said. India has 604 districts. The rain deficit since June 1 worsened to 28 percent at the weekend, raising fears that the season may turn out to be as bad as 2004 when summer crop output fell 12 percent after a drought. The rains are vital for sugarcane, oilseeds and other crops. Mukherjee said the government was ready to manage a drought and a contingency plan was also in place. ""Of course, always there is a contingency plan,"" the minister said. ""There is no point of pressing the panic button because you will go and start chanting drought, drought, drought and it will have an adverse impact,"" he said. Among measures the government could take to mitigate the situation are to raise imports and curtail exports. It has already stepped up efforts to buy more sugar and has banned wheat exports and restricted rice shipments. ""Fortunately, Punjab and Haryana have extensively used the ground water. Bihar and certain other states, there are shortfalls,"" Mukherjee said. Asked whether the shorfall in rains would affect India's growth, he said he expected the economy to expand more than 6 percent in 2009/10, as predicted by the central bank. Asia's third largest economy expanded 6.7 percent in the last fiscal year, sharply lower than the 9 percent or more it grew in the previous three years, as the global economic crisis took a toll. Mukherjee was also confident that direct tax receipts for the 2009/10 fiscal year would be surpas"
en.15.139.371.2009.8.11,Facebook buys social media start-up FriendFeed,"SAN FRANCISCO Aug 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Facebook, the world's largest social networking site, said it will buy FriendFeed, netting a group of prized ex-Google engineers in the fast-growing Internet business. FriendFeed, an up-and-coming social media startup, lets people share content online in real time across various social networks and blogs. The service is similar to, though less popular than Twitter, the microblogging site that Facebook tried to buy for $500 million in 2008, according to sources familiar with the matter. Terms of the deal were not disclosed on Monday, but Facebook said FriendFeed would operate as it has for the time being as the teams determine long-term plans. Facebook's big gain in the acquisition is the engineering talent at FriendFeed, rather than the actual product, which has won critical praise, but lagged in popularity compared to Twitter, said Forrester Research analyst Jeremiah Owyang. ""These guys now how to build scalable, social applications,"" said Owyang. In a statement, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he admired the FriendFeed team for having created a service he described as simple and elegant. ""As this shows, our culture continues to make Facebook a place where the best engineers come to build things quickly that lots of people will use,"" said Zuckerberg. FriendFeed's four founders are former Google Inc employees who count well known products like Gmail and Google Maps among their accomplishments. Facebook said the founders will hold senior roles on its engineering and product teams. FriendFeed had talked with Facebook ""casually"" for a couple of months, and that it became clear that the teams were ""cut from the same cloths,"" FriendFeed co-founder Bret Taylor told Reuters in an interview. He declined to say whether FriendFeed had been in talks with other companies. One bridge between Facebook and FriendFeed might have been Matt Cohler, Facebook's former management vice president. He joined FriendFeed backer Benchmark Capital last year. Asked what role the connection played in the deal, FriendFeed's Taylor said the decision to be acquired by Facebook was made entirely by the team at FriendFeed. Facebook has more than 250 million registered users. In May, the social networking company announced a $200 million investment from Russian investor Digital Sky Technologies that pegged the value of its preferred shares at $10 billion. Facebook has said its revenue is on track to rise 70 percent this year, and board member Mark Andreessen has said the company will bring in more than $500 million in revenue in 2009. But Forrester's Owyang said that Facebook must make the content generated within the site more accessible to the public instead of only to closed networks of Facebook friends, so that the company can sell more ads. Earlier this year, Facebook announced changes to its privacy controls to allow people to make their status messages and posts viewable to a broader Internet audie"
en.15.139.453.2009.8.10,US targets Afghan drug lords tied to Taliban: report,"WASHINGTON Mon Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States has placed 50 suspected Afghan drug traffickers with ties to the Taliban on a Pentagon target list to be captured or killed, The New York Times reported on Monday, citing a Congressional report to be released this week. Major drugs traffickers with proven links to the Taliban have been given the same target status as insurgent leaders, and can be captured or killed at any time, two US generals serving in Afghanistan said in interviews with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is releasing the report. The New York Times said the generals told Senate staff members that there are about 50 major traffickers who contribute money to the Taliban on the list. The pursuit of Afghan drug lords reflects a major shift in US policy and is likely to raise legal concerns from some NATO countries that have troops in Afghanistan, the newspaper said. US military commanders have told Congress they are convinced that the policy is legal under the military's rules of engagement and international law, the report said. They also said the move is an essential part of a new plan to disrupt the flow of drug money that is helping finance the Taliban insurgency, the Times reported. Several people suspected of ties to drug trafficking have already been captured and others have been killed by the US military since the policy went into effect earlier this year, the Times reported, citing a senior military official with direct knowledge of the matter. Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Patrick Ryder, would not comment on the Senate report nor directly address the existence of the target list, the newspaper said. However Ryder said it was ""important to clarify that we are targeting terrorists with links to the drug trade, rather than targeting drug traffickers with links to terrori"
en.15.139.472.2009.8.12,Aussie selectors dither over Clark for Ashes decider,"SYDNEY, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paceman Stuart Clark is not guaranteed a place in Australia's team for the fifth and deciding Ashes Test against England despite his strong performance at Headingley, chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said on Wednesday. Clark was overlooked for the first three Tests but played a prominent role when he was recalled for last week's fourth match, which Australia won to square the series at 1-1. Australia's selectors were widely criticised for not picking Clark earlier but Hilditch said they were right to choose Mitchell Johnson, Ben Hilfenhaus and Peter Siddle ahead of him. ""Although they've probably taken a bit of time to hit their straps, the reality is all three are now the leading wicket-takers in the Ashes, so I think all those selections have been absolutely spot-on,"" Hilditch told reporters in Australia. ""Stuart Clark got the nod and he did a good job but the other three bowled exceptionally well as well and took more wickets. ""So I think we go into the final Test with those three fast bowlers as our leading bowlers at the moment."" With Johnson, Hilfenhaus and Siddle seemingly assured of their places for the last Test at The Oval, the biggest issue facing Australia's selectors is whether to stick with Clark or recall spinner Nathan Hauritz. Fast bowler Brett Lee will also be available after recovering from injury but The Oval's reputation as a wicket that suits spin bowlers could give Hauritz the advantage. ""I've got to say from a selection point of view I've been thrilled with the Ashes, I think it's gone particularly well,"" Hilditch said. ""The Oval will be a tough Test, we're going to have tough selections."""

DJ Trahan ended up in the right fairway with the opening shot at the par-four first before being followed by fellow Americans Keith Dicciani and Briny Baird. World number one Woods, fresh from victory in his last two starts on the PGA Tour, was scheduled to start from the 10th hole at 0835 local time (2:45 pm British time). Woods, hunting his 15th major title but first this year, has been grouped with holder Padraig Harrington and 2002 champion Rich Beem for the first two rounds. Harrington clinched last year's PGA Championship by two shots at Oakland Hills in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan where Woods was a notable absentee while recovering from knee surgery. It was the Irishman's third major victory in six starts, following earlier successes at the British Open in 2007 and 2008. Masters champion Angel Cabrera of Argentina was set to tee off from the first at 1335 (7:35 pm British time) with US Open winner Lucas Glover and British Open champion Stewart Cink. In other high-profile groups, twice champion Vijay Singh has been drawn with former winners Davis Love III and Steve Elkington while Phil Mickelson, the 2005 champion at Baltusrol, will play with fellow Americans David Toms and Paul Azinger.

en.15.139.29.2009.8.13,"Chaotic growth, collapsing amenities the 'perfect equation' for water-logging","Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)Chaotic urban growth and collapsing civic amenities have combined to create the perfect equation for the city's chronic water-logging problem, a roundtable was told on Wednesday. ""Twenty-three natural canals that drain rain water into the Buriganga River remain heavily clogged with waste material, this is due to utterly unplanned urban development,"" Sardar Amin, president of Bangladesh Development and Information Forum, told the roundtable at Mukti Bhaban. Amin called on activists to build a 'common platform' to campaign for an end to the miseries caused by the long-standing problem. The city's inability to cope was sharply highlighted on July 28, when record breaking overnight rains brought Dhaka to a standstill. The capital's crumbling amenities and drainage system collapsed under the weight of the water, leaving low-lying areas inundated under knee-to-waist high water, streets impassable and thousands of people stranded in homes. Concrete pipes used to drain some areas in the city are of low-quality and lack the diameter to efficiently transfer water to the main drainage system, said Amin. He said WASA, as the responsible body for dealing with water-logging in the city, had failed to install sufficient pumping stations. ""The storm-water drainage system is also far too small,"" said Amin, who added that the public were partially to blame for polluting drains and canals in the city. Kazi Md Shish, a former chief engineer of WASA, accused the utility provider of chronic mismanagement and of misleading government ministries regarding water-logging. Shish said poor coordination between government agencies such as the Water Development Board, WASA, Dhaka City Corporation and RAJUK led to chaos and corruption in the construction and maintenance of civic infrastructure. He suggested that service providers should be brought under a single authority to ensure efficiency and accountability. President of the Communist Party of Bangladesh, Manjurul Ahsan Khan, presided at the discussion and suggested a single umbrella organisation could effectively coordinate activism on the critical issue. Khan said public awareness of environmental issues was essential to finding a long-term solution to the problem. The discussion was titled 'Urban Water Logging Problem: Citizens' Thoughts', organised by Nagorik Songhoti and Bangladesh Development and Information Forum"
en.15.139.212.2009.8.12,Mumbai attack justice high priority for Obama: diplomat,"NEW DELHI, Aug 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ensuring justice in last November's Mumbai attack is a ""high priority"" for President Obama and the United States will keep pressing Pakistan for action against its planners, a top US diplomat said on Wednesday. The comments by Timothy Roemer, the new US ambassador to India, are the strongest remark from the United States in recent months as India complains of slow progress by Pakistan in punishing those behind the attack. India blames Pakistan-based militants for the raid that killed 166 people and renewed tensions between the nuclear-armed South Asian rivals. New Delhi said it was halting a 2004 peace process until Pakistan closed down ""terrorist networks"" on its soil. ""The al-Qaeda, the Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba ... we have a common enemy with India. And we are pressing Pakistan hard on the Mumbai suspects,"" said Roemer, who served on the commission to investigate the September 11 attacks on the United States. ""So this is a high priority for the president (Obama) and a high priority for the government to work with India on these efforts and to bring the perpetrators of this brutal attack, this blood-thirsty attack on Mumbai to justice."" India and Pakistan have shown signs of moving forward, opening an official level dialogue, partly pushed by Washington which wants the two countries to reduce tensions so that Islamabad can concentrate on fighting Islamist militants on its Afghan border. But their formal peace process remains suspended. Pakistan says it is committed to fighting terrorism and has arrested five people India blamed for the attack. The list does not, however, include Hafiz Saeed, the founder of the militant group India has said was behind the attack, with Pakistan saying the evidence given by India failed to build a case for the arrest of Saeed. Saeed was detained in the wake of the November attacks after a UN Security Council resolution put him on a list of people and organizations supporting al Qaeda. But in June, a Pakistani court released him on grounds of insufficient evidence, prompting the Pakistan government to lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court for his re-arrest. The Supreme Court has adjourned the hearing without fixing a new date. Asked if India's evidence against Saeed was credible, Roemer said he had told his government about the need to bring all the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack to justice. ""Wherever they are I have communicated to my government several times ... that the people held in Pakistan for Mumbai attacks need to be brought to justice and that includes everybody that you mentioned,"" he said to a question about the evidence on Sa"

""This is not a doping offence,"" Mohammed Moosajee, the team's manager and doctor, told Reuters after the Indian Premier League (IPL) contacted Steyn about a test carried out while the world's number one test bowler was playing in the league. ""This is not a failed drugs test, this is an adverse analytical finding, which is a different matter.

Disney has tried before with other Miyazaki films in the United States and Canada, but has found little success. In 2003, his ""Spirited Away"" earned a best animated film Oscar, but only $10 million at US and Canadian box offices. In 2005, his ""Howl's Moving Castle"" made only $4.7 million in ticket sales. Elsewhere around the world, ""Spirited Away"" hauled in $265 million and ""Howl's Moving Castle"" drew $230 million. For ""Ponyo,"" Disney went Hollywood with a Miyazaki film by enlisting stars Tina Fey, Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett to provide the voices in a bid to bolster the movie's appeal. Moreover, the studio's chief creative office and Pixar whiz, John Lasseter, who is considered a master of computer animation having directed ""Toy Story,"" ""Cars"" and other movies, signed up to produce an English-language version. ""I've wanted Disney to distribute all of his films,"" Lasseter told Reuters. ""I want everybody to see all his films, because they're so inventive and fantastic."" Miyazaki, 68, has been called ""the Walt Disney of Japan,"" but he told Reuters through a translator that the tag is unwarranted because the late Walt Disney was a ""business person"" and he himself is ""just a director."" And he was little worried about the U.S. box office success for ""Ponyo,"" which already has made more than $160 million in Japan. ""Since John (Lasseter) is right beside me, it's hard for me to say this, but I'm not that concerned whether it's going to be a success or not,"" Miyazaki said. ""I came here to show that I am responsible for what I made."" BOY MEETS FISH In ""Ponyo,"" which was produced by Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli, a fish named Ponyo wants to become a little girl, and she befriends a boy named Sosuke in a Japanese coastal town. Boy and fish fall in love, but when Ponyo magically becomes a human girl, her transformation triggers powerful forces that threaten to upset the world's natural balance. In the English version, Frankie Jonas, the younger brother of pop music trio the Jonas Brothers, provided the voice for Sosuke, while Noah Cyrus, younger sister of ""Hannah Montana"" star Miley Cyrus, lent her voice to Ponyo. ""Ponyo"" is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Little Mermaid."" Disney's 1989 version of that tale was a huge hit. Miyazaki updated the 19th century story with images of environmental degradation and renewal. Miyazaki uses old-style, hand-drawn animation instead of the computer-generated cartoons that for a decade have dominated big-time Hollywood animated movies from the likes of Disney/Pixar and DreamWorks Animation. In large part, owing to his years at Pixar and now Disney, Lasseter is responsible for the shift toward using computers to draw cartoons instead of people. Still, he calls Miyazaki's work ""mind-blowing."" ""I've never, ever agreed that audiences are tired of watching hand-drawn animation, that they only want to watch computer animation,"" he said. ""Because it's not the medium that makes a movie entertaining, it's what you do with"

""The names of 69 people who were killed in post-election unrest ... were submitted to parliament for investigation. The report also included the names of about 220 detainees,"" said Alireza Hosseini Beheshti. Iranian authorities have said some 26 people were killed in the unrest after the vote, which opposition leaders say was rigged to secure the re-election of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He was officially sworn in on Wednesday. Judiciary spokesman Alireza Jamshidi said on Tuesday over 4,000 protesters had been arrested nationwide since the vote. ""But 3,700 of them were released in the first week after their arrest,"" Jamshidi told a news conference. Among those still in prison are senior pro-reform politicians, journalists, activists and lawyers. Parliament speaker Ali Larijani said parliament would carefully review cases of the detainees and those killed in the post-election unrest, the Etemad-e melli newspaper reported on Tuesday. Defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karoubi on Sunday said on his website that some protesters, both male and female, had been raped while in detention and that he had written to the head of a powerful arbitration body calling for an investigation. ""Such claims (of rape and abuse of detainees) will be investigated by parliament,"" Larijani said. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered a prison's closure in July, citing a ""lack of necessary standards"" to preserve prisoners' rights, and police chief Esmail Ahmadi-Moghaddam said some of the protesters held at the Kahrizak detention center had been tortured. Many of the post-election detainees were held in Kahrizak in southern Tehran, which was built to house people who broke the country's vice laws.

A Los Angeles Police Department spokesman said detectives requested the autopsy, which includes toxicology tests, remain sealed until their investigation was finished. He could not say when it would be completed and declined to offer more details. Some media outlets reported that the ""Thriller"" singer's body has now been buried at the Forest Lawn cemetery in Los Angeles, but that could not immediately be confirmed through a family spokesman. A cemetery spokesman declined to comment. Police are looking into why the 50-year-old singer died suddenly of cardiac arrest on June 25. Numerous media reports have said officials are focused on Jackson's use of a powerful anesthetic called propofol to sleep. Police and federal agents have raided several offices of Jackson's doctors as part of their probe. Meanwhile, the judge overseeing the singer's will said he had approved several business deals, including a $60 million agreement with Columbia Pictures to make a movie from video of the King of Pop's rehearsals for a series of concerts that had been set to take place in London this past July. Those shows were dubbed ""This Is It"" by Jackson, and the movie will be similarly titled. Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp's Sony Pictures Entertainment, said the film, due to be in theaters on Oct. 30, will have performances and behind-the-scenes video of Jackson preparing for the concerts. Some of it will be shown in movie theaters in 3-D. The judge also agreed to the re-issuance of the singer's autobiography, ""Moonwalk,"" currently planned for October. Lawyers spent much of Monday in court wrangling over merchandising deals still being planned and a traveling exhibition of Jackson memorabilia that concert promoter AEG Live, which had backed the London concerts, wants to mount. RESURGENT POPULARITY Attorneys for Jackson's mother, Katherine, said they had concerns about the involvement of AEG in deals struck with the executors of the pop star's estate. Judge Mitchell Beckloff said he could not approve the deals for the traveling exhibition and merchandising rights until he appoints an attorney to represent the interests of Jackson's three minor children, who along with Katherine Jackson are beneficiaries of the estate. As a result, he put off his decision on whether to approve the two deals until Aug. 17. An attorney for AEG Live, which spent as much as $30 million preparing for the comeback concerts, had argued that to help recoup its investment it needed to move quickly to take advantage of the resurgence in the singer's popularity. Several of the ""Thriller"" singer's albums, for instance, have returned to the top of the music charts in recent weeks, whereas before his death his CD sales had languished. ""The longer we wait, the more time passes, frankly the less interest there will be on the part of the public to come see the exhibit,"" said Kathy Jorrie, an attorney for AEG Live. Jackson's ""Number Ones"" CD, originally released in 1993, is the second-best selling album of 2009 in the United States, with sales this year of 1.4 million copies, according to tracking firm Nielsen SoundScan. Only Taylor Swift's 2008 release ""Fearless,"" with 1.5 million copies sold so far this year, stands in the way. Jackson was said to be as much as $500 million in debt when he died, but the value of his estate was reported to be as high as $1 billion given his part ownership in a music catalog and his control of his own songs. Jorrie told the judge that attorneys for his mother have demanded AEG Live give the estate its rehearsal video, something that AEG is not willing to do. AEG is owned by reclusive Denver billionaire Philip Ansch"
en.15.139.237.2009.8.10,Edinburgh Fringe ticket sales defy recession,"EDINBURGH, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - The theatres, outdoor stages and pubs are crammed every night and ticket purchases are defying the recession at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. ""In the current economic climate people are looking to the arts to cheer them up,"" Fringe chief executive Kath Mainland told Reuters. ""Visitor numbers this August have the potential to be very positive as people choose to holiday closer to home."" Advance box office sales for the 2009 Fringe in the Scottish capital were up 20 percent compared to the same period in 2007, when final sales hit a record 1.69 million. Bob Hotsby, a 64-year-old retired potato merchant from northern England, came to Edinburgh with his family for the Fringe as well as the international book, art, jazz festivals and the military tattoo. ""The general atmosphere is electric because everyone is enjoying themselves,"" he said. Despite the credit crunch, the Fringe -- the world's largest open access arts festival -- has expanded to 34,265 performances of 2,098 shows in 265 venues compared with 31,320 performances of 2,088 shows in 247 venues in 2008. Performers have registered shows originating in 60 different countries. Dance, theater and exhibitions are on offer alongside the wacky and wonderful comedy that has made the Fringe a launch pad for performers, writers and directors. Street performers such as Herbie Treehead, a Fringe veteran of 21 years, come from all over the world. The pickings can be rich if your act is good enough to persuade members of the public to part with five to 10 pounds at the end of a show. ""If I get a good show like I did last night, I'll get 700-800 people,"" said Treehead, whose act combines jokes, slapstick and a pantomime horse. The three-week Fringe has compared its 2009 sales to 2007 because of a box office technology glitch in 2008, when final ticket sales were 1.5 million. It generates around 75 million pounds ($126 million) for the Edinburgh and Scottish economy. Mainland said the weakness of the British pound against the euro was a double gift for Edinburgh, making visits more affordable for European tourists while Britons enjoy so-called ""staycations"" rather than going abroad. ""There is already anecdotal evidence coming in about people from the rest of the UK choosing Edinburgh as a destination this year instead of going abroad,"" he said"

Merchant, who died in 2005 aged 68, was best known for his collaboration with US director James Ivory, and they made a string of critically acclaimed movies including ""A Room With a View"", ""Howards End"" and ""The Remains of the Day"". The auction will include works of art from Merchant's properties in London, Paris and upstate New York, as well as a small selection from his New York apartment. Estimates range from 500-100,000 pounds ($830-166,000) and the sale overall is expected to raise around 500,000 pounds. Among the highlights is a large painting showing a group of Indian Thugges by Hungarian artist August Schoefft which is expected to fetch 70-100,000 pounds. The auction will also include a small group of film memorabilia including props from Merchant Ivory pictures. Merchant was born in Mumbai in 1936 and became a film producer after moving to New York. He met Ivory and, together with screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, they formed Merchant Ivory Productions in the early 1960s. They made over 40 films which picked up six Academy Awards and helped launched the movie careers of actors including Hugh Grant and Helena Bonham Car"
en.15.139.138.2009.8.13,American of Bangladeshi descent convicted in US terror case,"Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)A US federal jury has found Ehsanul Islam Sadequee, an American of Bangladeshi descent, guilty on terrorism charges, after a trial that lasted seven days. Sadequee, 23, arrested in Bangladesh by the FBI in 2006, faces up to 60 years in federal prison, a statement of the US State Department said on Thursday. He was convicted of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists, including Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LET). Sentencing is scheduled on Oct. 15. According to the evidence presented during the trial, which began on August 3, 2009, Sadequee was born in Fairfax, Virginia, in 1986. He attended school in the United States, Canada, and Bangladesh. In December 2001, while living in Bangladesh, he sent an email seeking to join the Taliban, to help them in their fight against United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan, said trial documents. In late 2004 and early 2005, Sadequee, having returned to the United States to his family home in Roswell, Georgia, entered an illegal agreement - a conspiracy - with others to provide material support to terrorists engaged in ""violent jihad"", said prosecutors. ""The evidence indicated that the material support consisted of Sadequee's co-defendant, Syed Haris Ahmed, who was convicted after a bench trial in June 2009; and other individuals who intended to provide themselves as personnel to engage in violent jihad abroad and in the United States,"" said the prosecutors' statement. The evidence also included short videos of symbolic and infrastructure targets for potential terrorist attacks in the Washington DC area, including the US Capitol and the World Bankall of which were taken by Sadequee and Syed Haris Ahmed to be sent to ""the jihadi brothers"" abroad. At trial the government presented evidence that Sadequee and his co-conspirators used the internet to develop relationships and maintain contact with each other and with other supporters of violent jihad in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, Bosnia and elsewhere. ""In March 2005, Sadequee and his co-conspirators planned to travel to Pakistan in an effort to attend a paramilitary training camp operated by terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Tayeba (LET), as preparation for engaging in violent jihad abroad or in the United States,"" prosecutors said. The government also presented evidence at trial that in 2005, Sadequee departed Atlanta for Bangladesh, carrying with him, hidden in the lining of his suitcase, an encrypted CD, a map of Washington DC, that included all of the targets he and Syed Haris Ahmed had cased. Once in Bangladesh, Sadequee began to conspire more closely with Younis Tsouli and Mirsad Bektasevic, a Swedish national of Serbian origins. Specifically, Tsouli, Bektasevic, Sadequee and others formed a violent jihadist organization known as ""Al Qaeda in Northern Europe."" The group was to be based in Sweden and focus on terrorist attacks in Europe. The evidence at trial showed that in October 2005, Sadequee sought a visa that would allow him to relocate from Bangladesh to Sweden. Bektasevic has since been convicted of terrorism offenses in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is imprisoned there. Meanwhile, Syed Haris Ahmed remained in contact with Sadequee, and in March 2006, Ahmed was approached by FBI agents. Efforts by the FBI to obtain Ahmed's cooperation in the ongoing international terrorism investigation ended after the FBI discovered that Ahmed was surreptitiously contacting Sadequee, who was still in Bangladesh, to advise him of the FBI investigation and warn him not to return to the United States. Sadequee was eventually arrested on April 20, 2006, in Bangladesh, on charges arising out of false statements he made in an August 2005 interview with the FBI at JFK Airport in the Eastern District of New York. Sadequee was indicted in the district on July 19, 2006, and transferred to Atlanta in August of that year. The case was investigated by agents and officers of the Atlanta Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), led by the FBI's Atlanta Division, with assistance from law enforcement agencies in several other countries. The jury deliberated for approximately five hours before reaching the guilty verdict in the trial presided over by US district judge William S Duffey, Jr. Sadequee elected to represent himself, with stand-by counsel present to assist him as requested"
en.15.139.271.2009.8.14,"Medvedev, Merkel talk economy, human rights","SOCHI, Russia, Aug 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany and Russia should work closer together to beat the downturn, Russia's president told his German counterpart on Friday at the start of talks which will focus on the economy but also touch on human rights. President Dmitry Medvedev welcomed German Chancellor Angela Merkel to his official vacation residence at the Black Sea resort of Sochi for their third meeting this year, in a gesture that showed close ties between Berlin and Moscow. ""We shall think how by strengthening our bilateral economic strategic ties we could help our economies and people overcome the consequences of this heavy crisis and come out of it even stronger,"" Medvedev told Merkel. A senior Russian official told reporters ahead of the talks that the leaders would discuss a bid by Canadian carmaker Magna and Russia's Sberbank to buy a stake in Opel, the European unit of General Motors, and a number of other investment projects. Trade between Russia and Germany, Russia's biggest trading partner in Europe, reached a record $67.2 billion in 2008. That figure has been cut by more than half in the first five months of 2009, the official said, without giving a precise number. Merkel has backed the Magna-Sberbank bid over a competing offer from Belgian private equity firm RHJ International and Russia hopes she will reiterate that support during the talks, a senior official in the Russian delegation said. On Thursday, a senior Magna executive said agreement in principle had been reached with General Motors to buy the stake. But a GM official later said the race was not over. ""We view (the Magna-Sberbank bid's) chances highly, they have become much stronger, he said. Medvedev and Merkel will also discuss finding Russian investors for struggling firms like Dresden chipmaker Qimonda and Germany's fifth biggest shipbuilder, Wadan, he said. Kommersant daily reported on Friday that Russian services conglomerate Sistema was seeking to take a stake in Infineon, which holds a 77.5 percent in insolvent Qimonda. Wadan is owned by Russian investor Andrey Burlakov, who is looking for ways to save the insolvent shipyard. ""Given proper social and economic reasons and commercial guarantees, such projects can become springboards for strategic alliances between Russian and German hi-tech companies in car making, shipbuilding and electronics,"" the Kremlin official said. ""This will complement the existing and emerging alliances in the energy sector,"" he added referring to Nord Stream, an ambitious project to deliver Siberian gas under the Baltic Sea to Europe. Russia wants to boost German support for the project in the face of the concerns of some European states that it could harm the Baltic Sea and strengthen Russia's grip on the continent's energy supplies. Germany regularly voices concern over human rights in Russia, an issue which returned to the limelight after the killing of several rights activists in Russia this year and Merkel said she would raise the issue with Medvedev. ""I do believe that the subject lies close to his heart. But actions must also follow,"" she said on Thursday. Merkel said she would specifically raise the killing of a children's charity head Zarema Sadulayeva and her husband in Chechnya earlier this week. ""It is absolutely unacceptable,"" she s"

""He (Pietersen) was seen by a wound care specialist yesterday and will receive a course of antibiotics in order to exclude infection,"" an ECB statement read. ""Medical advice is that a complication can occur post surgery and in this case resulted despite Kevin closely following specialist advice on management of the wound."" The 29-year-old right-hander was ruled out of the remainder of the Ashes series following surgery after the second Test against Australia. ""He will be reassessed by the specialist later this week and will return to his planned programme of rehabilitation once the wound has fully healed,"" the statement added. His absence in England's Ashes side has coincided with some poor batting performances and the series is now tied at 1-1 with one match remaining at the Oval starting on August 20. The South African-born Pietersen, who averages 49.96 from 54 Tests, has scored 4,647 runs including 16 centuries since making his debut against Australia in 2005. Once the Test series is over, England play Australia in a one-off Twenty20 international on September 1 followed by a seven-match one-day international series starting on September 4.

Golf is vying with rugby, squash, karate, roller sports, baseball and softball and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will announce a shortlist of two sports on Thursday. In two months' time a final vote will decide whether those two sports will be part of the Games programme. ""If I'm not retired by then, yeah,"" Woods, 33, told reporters with a broad grin while preparing for this week's US PGA Championship at Hazeltine National. Again asked if he would compete at the Olympics in 2016 when he would be 40, the American world number one replied: ""Yep."" Woods, a 14-time major winner and arguably the greatest player of all time, has been actively involved in golf's push for a return to the Olympics. In April, he wrote personally to the IOC member for the United States in support of the International Golf Federation's bid. ""Golf is a truly global sport and it should have been in the Olympics a while ago,"" Woods said. ""If it does get in, I think it would be great for golf, and especially (for) some of the other smaller countries that are now emerging in golf. GOLFING EXPOSURE ""It's a great way for them to compete and play and get the exposure that some of these countries aren't getting."" Three-time major winner Padraig Harrington, the defending champion at Hazeltine this week, also expressed enthusiasm for golf's Olympic bid. ""I'd love to be an Olympian,"" the Irishman said. ""Doesn't that sound good? Imagine us being Olympic athletes. I think it would be fantastic for golf."" Harrington felt golf's renowned etiquette and innate sense of fair play made it a natural choice as an Olympic sport. ""As a golfer, I would think we have all the credentials to be Olympians,"" he said. ""Most of the time, we don't have referees out there. We are playing away on our own. ""It seems like golf was always destined to be an Olympic sport. I'm sure there are a lot of athletes out there who would never put golf (down) as a sport, but try to explain that to somebody who doesn't play golf. ""They will never understand what goes into golf.

At least 22 rebels and 23 soldiers were killed in a military assault on Wednesday on a base of Abu Sayyaf rebels in the interior of the southern island of Basilan, Brigadier-General Rustico Guerrero told reporters. ""We launched a decisive law enforcement operation targeting the Abu Sayyaf's main training base on Basilan, but we were met by heavy resistance,"" Guerrero said. Other officials said the battle died down after eight hours, as the guerrillas fled into the heavily wooded interior of the island. Rear Admiral Alexander Pama, a commander on Basilan, said an estimated 40 rebels were killed, but only 22 bodies had been recovered at the scene of the conflict. ""It was close quarter combat, the two sides almost came into hand-to-hand battle,"" Pama told Reuters, adding the proximity meant the military could not call in air strikes. ""What's more important for us was we've disrupted their crude bomb factory and training base."" The Abu Sayyaf, the smallest but the most deadly of several Muslim groups fighting for independence from Manila in the south of the Roman Catholic state, is estimated to have about 350 hard-core followers based mostly on Basilan and the nearby island of Jolo. It has links with Jemaah Islamiah, a pan-Asian radical Muslim group blamed for attacks in Indonesia, including the 2002 Bali bombings and the bomb attacks on two hotels in Jakarta last month. Abu Sayyaf is blamed for the worst militant attack in the Philippines, the sinking of a ferry in Manila Bay in 2004 in which 100 people were killed. It has also been in the spotlight for high-profile kidnappings, most recently of three Red Cross officials on Jolo who were later freed.

""Anti-liberation forces committed an ill act to destroy the tradition, culture, and progress of the Bangla nation through the killing,"" the prime minister said in her message to the nation on the eve of Aug 15 National Mourning Day. Mujib and members of his family were killed in their home by army officers on Aug 15 1975. Hasina and her younger sister Rehana, in West Germany at the time, were the only survivors of the immediate family. ""Bangabandhu was killed as he was engaged in making a war-torn country into his dream of a Golden Bengladesh by uniting all,"" said Hasina in her statement. She reminisced about those killed on the day and wished peace for all of their souls. Hasina said the killers, anti liberation forces, were rewarded instead of brought to justice for the killings. She also said they introduced the politics of murders, coups and conspiracies to the newly-born nation, toppling the constitutional government of Bangladesh.

At a seminar titled 'Micro credit: interest rates and transparency' organised by Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation, Muhith said efforts should be on to find the root causes or any strategic faults associated with such failure. ""In the past few years, Bangladesh has progressed considerably as regards human resource development, but our advancement in poverty reduction hasn't been up to the mark,"" said the finance minister. ""It's really hard to foretell how long we'll have to fight poverty. It may very well be a 10 or even 20 years' war. ""Microcredit is a major combat weapon used in our battle against poverty. The NGOs claim that 30 million Bangladeshis have access to microcredit today. ""Since we have over 70 million poor people fighting to come out of the poverty cycle, we need to review the overall microcredit situation and determine why the poor in greater numbers are not being able to access the poverty alleviation opportunities."" On the varying and rather high interest rates, he said, ""Many raise questions about the interest rates slapped by the microcredit organisations. Grameen Bank has reduced its lending interest rates."" ""The more the NGOs will be expanding their credit programmes, the lower their lending interest rates should be.

Many web users in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Philippines experienced slow Internet connections this week as undersea landslides damaged cables connecting them to websites hosted in the United States. Full repair work on the damaged cables will only be completed in about two months, and Chunghwa is working with other affected telecommunications companies in the region to use alternative routes to restore connectivity. Chunghwa Telecom, a former state-owned monopoly and Taiwan's largest telecoms company, shares the undersea cables with other operators in East Asia.

Clinton arrived in the capital Kinshasa from neighboring Angola for a two-day visit that will include a trip to Goma, capital of the violent North Kivu province. Congo's government and the U.N.'s biggest peacekeeping force are struggling to stabilize the east of the vast central African country after decades of dictatorship and the 1998-2003 war. ""I will be pressing very hard not just for assistance to help those being abused and mistreated ... particularly the women who are being turned into weapons of war through the rape they experience ... but also for ways to try to end this conflict,"" Clinton told reporters. ""I am going to Goma to speak out against the unspeakable violence against women and girls in eastern Congo,"" Clinton earlier said. ""It is the worst example of man's inhumanity to women, and women are being used in conflicts."" Clinton said she wanted to address the root causes of the conflict, including the trade in minerals such cassiterite and coltan, which are dug in eastern Congo for use in consumer electronics and whose sale funds armed groups there. ""There is a lot of money being made in eastern Congo because of the mineral trade,"" she said. The United Nations has accused all sides of human rights abuses in mineral-rich Congo, including mass killings, rape and lootings. In Goma, tens of thousands of displaced people are packed into camps and are particularly vulnerable to attacks. While in Goma, Clinton is also expected to meet President Joseph Kabila. ""We are going to press on working for ways to create broader political legitimacy and credibility by his government across the country,"" she said. Elections in 2006 were seen as an important step toward the return of law and order after nearly 15 years of violence, during which Congolese rebel groups and foreign armies fought two wars, committed abuses and looted the nation's minerals. Rights groups say over 600 civilians have been killed and thousands of women and girls raped by both government and rebel forces in a new spike in violence since the start of UN-backed military operations by Congolese forces in January. ""The UN-backed offensive that was supposed to make life better for the people of eastern Congo is instead becoming a human tragedy,"" said Marcel Stoessel of Oxfam. ""Secretary Clinton needs to make it very clear that U.S. support for the UN's efforts in Congo is not a blank cheque and that civilians should be protected."" Following the theme of her 11-day Africa trip, Clinton will also urge the government to make greater efforts to fight corruption and better manage the country's resources for development purposes. She delivered the same anti-corruption message in Angola on Sunday and Monday when she met the country's leaders and will repeat it during her visit later this week to Nigeria."

""We have enormous respect and great appreciation for the Turkish efforts. But they have not succeeded -- not because of the Turks,"" Deputy Israeli Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon told Reuters in an interview. ""It's because of Syrian intransigence,"" he added, saying there would be no new recourse to Turkish mediation. Netanyahu's centrist predecessor Ehud Olmert engaged Damascus through Ankara last year, with all sides reporting some progress. A political scandal that forced Olmert from office, and Israel's January war in Gaza, put those contacts on hold. In power since March, Netanyahu has offered direct talks without preconditions -- a reference to the Syrian demand that Israel commit itself in advance to returning the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in a 1967 war. Israel also insists Syria distance itself from Iran and from Islamist guerrillas arrayed against the Jewish state in Lebanon and Gaza. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been dismissive of that demand and predicted no breakthroughs with Netanyahu. Asked if the Netanyahu government was ruling out a return to the mediated talks, which both Turkey and Syria have proposed reviving, Ayalon said: ""Correct."" ""We have just benefited from the experience that shows that proximity talks did not work,"" he said, speaking in English. ""If they (Syria) are really serious on peace, and not just a peace process which may serve them to extricate them from international isolation, if they are really serious, they will come and sit with us."" US DIPLOMACY The overtures to Olmert helped Assad's relations with the West, long frayed over Syrian involvement in neighbouring Lebanon and Iraq, alleged pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, and sponsorship of Palestinian militants. US President Barack Obama, who is trying to advance Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking as well as stabilise Iraq, has sent envoys to coax Syria into the circle of diplomacy. Like Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, Ayalon is from the far-right Yisrael Beitenu party, junior partner to Netanyahu's conservative Likud in the coalition government. Lieberman keeps a low media profile and has largely ceded public diplomacy to Ayalon, a former Israeli ambassador to Washingt"

The former world number one, who gave birth to her first child in February of last year, outplayed the former Wimbledon runner-up in one hour, 22 minutes. ""To have won my first match feels really good,"" Clijsters said in a courtside interview. I surprised myself a little with the way I started and then I kept fighting and trying to stay focused. I felt good out there."" Bartoli had won her previous tournament in Stanford, California, but was shocked by Clijsters' early onslaught. The Belgian dropped just five points as she charged to a 4-0 lead and though Bartoli hit back to level at 4-4, Clijsters broke two games later to take the opening set. After saving two break points in the third game of the second set, Clijsters broke to lead 3-1 and held her nerve to set up a meeting with Patty Schnyder of Switzerland. Earlier, Ana Ivanovic and Victoria Azarenka fended off tough opposition to reach the second round. Former French Open champion Ivanovic recovered from a poor start to beat American teenager Melanie Oudin 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 while ninth seed Azarenka saw off Kaia Kanepi of Estonia 6-3, 7-6. Azarenka, who has won three tournaments this year, has been tipped as a future world number one but the 20-year-old said she did not want to get carried away. ""It's nice that people talk about me maybe being number one at some time but I'm not really focused on that,"" she said. ""I'm focused on improving my game and taking it step by step."" Former world number one Ivanovic looked in danger of a shock defeat when 17-year-old Oudin, ranked 68th, ripped though the first set of their match. The Serb had trouble with her ball toss early on but recovered her composure to storm back in the next two sets. ""I didn't start so well and I had lots of unforced errors and lots of double faults,"" said Ivanovic, who now plays Melinda Czink of Hungary. ""But after the first set I just tried to talk to myself and just try to convince myself I have to be aggressive and play the way I should play and not wait for mistakes.""

""Nothing can slow the development and potential of a country with 7,500,000 overseas workers,"" said finance minister AMA Muhith at the Shonar Manush Shommanona 2009 awards ceremony. He said expatriates are ""agents of change"" playing an important role in rural development through investment in farming and livestock ventures, small-and-medium businesses and local hospitals and educational institutions in their home areas. Muhith pledged to take all necessary steps to solve expatriate workers' problems, saying ""we will not neglect them"". ""Stay patient and be confident. We are trying to solve your problems,"" Muhith assured them. Also attending the event, labour and expatriates welfare minister Khandker Musharraf Hossain said sustained high remittances were a key factor in the nation's economic development. ""We will become a mid-level income country by 2021 if remittances continue to rise,"" said Hossain. He said the government would also take measures to prevent unnecessary harassment at airports for returning overseas workers. Atiur Rahman, the Bangladesh Bank governor, termed the expatriates ""national heroes"", saying the impact of the global recession had been mitigated by remittances flowing into the country. 'Unsung heroes' Bangladesh's overseas workers, who remitted a record $9.6 billion or 12 percent of the country's total earnings in the last fiscal year, were also termed ""heroes"" at a Remittance Utshob, or Festival, earlier in the day, while the government was urged to properly evaluate the contribution of remittance earners to the economy. ""These valuable remitters and our garments workers are the 'unsung heroes' of the economy,"" Dhaka University economics professor Wahiduddin Mahmud said, speaking as chief guest at the Utshob. But, Mahmud said, the lack of detailed data regarding their work abroad, their situation when they return home, utilisation of their remittance and poor regulation signaled that the government still regarded the valuable foreign currency earning sector as an 'informal' one. ""The government only records how many people went abroad for work and the amount of remittance sent back in a year."" He said, ""Proper training and bank facilities should be provided before one leaves for work overseas, and rehabilitation and security for those who return being cheated or because of job loss."" Mahmud also lauded the performance of banks in increasing remittance transfers in recent years by encouraging overseas workers to send back more earnings. Deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank Ziaul Hassan Siddiqui said, ""The central bank is working to further ease money transfers and has approved joint ventures between small banks and NGOs to deliver remittance to the beneficiaries' door steps."" He also asked BAIRA (Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies) to reduce fees for sending people abroad, as a recent World Bank report criticised the rates as ""too high"". Awards The Shonar Manush honours are organised by the Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit, at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. The awards are given in categories for highest remittance, best remittance utilising family, grassroots bankers, migrant rights protection committees and recruiting agencies. This year's 'Highest Remittance' award winners were Abdul Halim Chowdhury from Comilla and Ruhul Amin from Keraniganj. Suraiya Yeasmin from Kalihati, Sobhan Mollah from Keraniganj and Mozaffar Alam from Chittagong received the 'Best Remittance Utilising Family' award. Three recruiting agencies, 11 bankers and three private organisations were also recognised for their significant performance in providing remittance services. The Remittance Utshob earlier in the day was also organised by RMMRU. Some 13 banks participated in the festival with BAIRA, BMET (Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training) and RMMRU also setting up stalls to deliver remittance related information to visitors. President of RMMRU Dr Tasneem Siddiui in her welcome speech urged the government to properly evaluate remittance earners' contribution to the economy. bdnews"
en.15.139.58.2009.8.12,Congo arrests Rwandan genocide suspect,"KINSHASA, Aug 12,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities in Democratic Republic of Congo have arrested a man accused of planning the massacre of at least 2,000 Rwandan Tutsis during the 1994 genocide, a government official said on Wednesday. Gregoire Ndahimana was arrested by Congolese soldiers on Sunday during UN-backed operations to stamp out Hutu rebel group the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) in violence ravaged eastern border province North Kivu. ""He was discovered by our units operating in North Kivu ... He was hiding among the FDLR,"" Congolese Information Minister Lambert Mende said. Ndahimana was a local administrator in the Rwandan town of Kivumu during Rwanda's genocide, in which around 800,000 Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed during 100 days in 1994. According to his indictment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), he is responsible for the deaths of at least 2,000 Tutsis, most of whom were killed when Hutus bulldozed the church where they were being held. By July 1994, ICTR prosecutors believe almost all of Kivumu's 6,000 Tutsi residents had been killed. The tribunal, based in the Tanzanian city of Arusha, was seeking Ndahimana's arrest for genocide or complicity in genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, and crimes against humanity for extermination. Twelve other ICTR indictees remain at large. ""(Ndahimana) is now in the hands of the military's operational authorities awaiting his transfer to Arusha,"" Mende said. Most of the former Rwandan military and Interahamwe militia members responsible for the genocide fled the country after Tutsi rebels led by Rwanda's current president, Paul Kagame, swept through the central African nation ending the killing. Their presence in eastern Congo, Rwanda's giant western neighbour, served as a pretext for two Rwandan interventions, which sparked a 1998-2003 war and humanitarian catastrophe that has claimed 5.4 million lives over the past 10 years. Earlier this year, the Congolese army, with the backing of the world's largest UN peacekeeping mission, launched military operations against the FDLR, whose ranks include some of the orchestrators of the genocide. During her visit to Congo, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Tuesday called upon the Congolese government and the United Nations to better protect civilians in the east, who have been targeted for reprisal attacks by reb"
en.15.139.465.2009.8.11,"Iraq bombs kill 42, fears of sectarian strife grow","MOSUL, Iraq, Aug 11(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bombs killed 42 people across Iraq on Monday, ripping through mostly Shi'ite areas and raising fears of a resurgence in sectarian violence just as politicians hope to reach out to old foes for January polls. The blasts are the latest of several major attacks targeting Shi'ites since US troops withdrew from urban centres in June, boosting doubts about whether Iraq's security forces, rebuilt from scratch after the 2003 US-led invasion, can cope alone. Two truck bombs shattered the dawn calm when they exploded within minutes of each other in the mostly Shi'ite village of al-Khazna, 20 km (12 miles) east of Mosul in Iraq's north, killing 30 people and wounding 155. The blasts destroyed some 40 houses in the village, home to the small Shabak community, a sect of Kurdish origin. Distraught people stood around a massive crater left by one of the blasts as firemen picked through the debris searching for bodies. ""What have we done for terrorists to kill innocents in their sleep?"" cried Umm Qasim, 35, her face covered in blood. She was sat in a truck and was holding her wounded son. The bodies of four relatives, including her husband and sister, lay nearby. Speaking at a televised conference, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said violence may increase ahead of January polls. ""The coming election will witness increasing attempts to damage and violate security. They will try, in any way they can, to show that the political process is not stable,"" he said. KURD-ARAB, SUNNI-SHI'ITE DISPUTES Bombs and shootings are reported almost daily in and around Mosul, capital of Nineveh province, where insurgents in Iraq have exploited disputes between Arabs and Kurds to remain strong even as their influence has waned elsewhere. A row between the Arab-led government in Baghdad and the largely autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq's north over land and oil has come dangerously close to all out war. Some analysts say insurgents want to trigger such a conflict to tear apart Iraq's fragile political process just as some politicians struggle to form alliances with other sectarian and ethnic groups ahead of January's parliamentary polls. ""The aim is to stall the political process and to bring it back to the era of sectarian conflict before the coming election,"" said analyst and professor Hameed Fadhel. Insurgents hide in remote, mountainous areas around Mosul, and there are fears they may gain support by styling themselves as an Arab bulwark against perceived Kurdish encroachment. There are also fears the targeting of Shi'ites may re-ignite sectarian slaughter in Iraq, which has only abated in the last 18 months, during which time Sunni, Shi'ite, Kurd and Christian politicians have tried to hammer out election alliances. Last week, a string of bombings targeting Shi'ites across Iraq killed 44 people. Sunni Islamist militants such as al Qaeda, who consider Shi'ites heretics, are often blamed. ELECTION THUNDERBOLT Maliki and his allies won major gains in provincial polls earlier this year, when they campaigned on a platform of increased security. A spike in violence ahead of national elections in January could derail his election plans. In Baghdad, a car bomb and a roadside bomb targeting laborers queuing for work killed seven people in mostly Shi'ite areas of the capital's southwest, a hospital source said. A later car bomb in the same area killed another two people. In other Baghdad attacks, roadside bombs and a bomb stuck to a bus killed three people and wounded 34. Monday's attacks come barely a week after the government said it would remove blast walls from Baghdad's main streets. The national elections will be a key test for Iraq's fledgling democracy and its security forces. Maliki is keen to assert Iraqi sovereignty after years of occupation. ""The vote will be a thunderbolt for those who do not want anything but dictatorship, sectarianism and bloodshed,"" he said. While violence has fallen sharply in the past 18 months, insurgents still manage to launch attacks in the face of largely untested Iraqi forces, who lack equipment and experience. US forces are due to leave Iraq by 2012 in accordance with a bilateral security pact between Washington and Bag"

""We are intensifying screening at land ports in the wake of the deaths in India as many people travel between the two countries,"" Prof Mahmudur Rahman, president of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, told bdnews24.com. He said more officials stationed at land ports between India and Bangladesh are receiving training in a bid to check the pandemic. ""The health authorities are also meeting twice a day to discuss the overall situation,"" said Prof Rahman. Indian media have reported sixth deaths to date from the H1N1 virus in India, and over six hundred infected, since the first fatality in the country was confirmed on Aug 4. Meanwhile, Bangladesh's Directorate General of Health Service has said it will ask the Uttara Modern Medical College Hospital to explain why they included the words 'Swine Flu' in a patient's death certificate on Saturday, Prof Rahman said. Both the IEDCR and the health ministry have said the deceased, one Sanwar Hossain, who returned from the Maldives on Saturday feeling unwell, had not died from swine flu as his case history did not match those of the virus. On Sunday, Prof Rahman said the patient had been suffering from a fever and respiratory problems, which can also be symptoms of swine flu. Sanwar was admitted to the hospital on Saturday afternoon and died at around 9pm. Director of Uttara Modern Medical College Hospital, Shahjahan Biswash, told bdnews24.com on Sunday that it had been a mistake to include the words 'Swine Flu' in the death certificate. The IEDCR has managed to confirm just 32 cases of swine flu in Bangladesh so far, almost all completely recovered. According to the World Health Organisation's latest figures, over 160,000 cases of swine flu have been detected in 161 countries worldwide, with recorded fatalities jumping to 1,154. WHO declared a global swine flu pandemic on June 11, while the health ministry confirmed the first case in Bangladesh on June 19. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. IEDCR advises schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu. It also advises people to refrain from spitting and to wash their hands regularly to curb the spread of the swine flu virus. bdne"

With a two-day gap before the third match the cricketers took this opportunity to recuperate, reports TigerCricket.com. ""There was swimming, recovery and massage today. The boys stayed at the hotel and rested. They have been playing non-stop so this was a welcome break. Some of the boys have slight niggles and they had treatment,"" said team operations manager Shafique-ul Haque Heera. The Tigers return to training Thursday afternoon to prepare for the game on Friday which could very well be the series clinching one. Captain Shakib Al Hasan scored a dazzling 64-ball 104, the fastest century by a Bangladeshi and the eighth quickest in ODI history, and took two wickets to star in the Bangladesh victory and the world's number one all-rounder was determined to maintain the momentum. ""I believe we have been successful so far because we could keep our concentration going for the entire match. Also, we never allowed pressure to get to us. The boys are playing according to the gameplan and I attribute the results to team effort. The series is still open and that's why we just need to keep our focus and do our job in the middle,"" said Shakib. Bangladesh have now won seven ODIs on the trot with Shakib himself on a five-match unbeaten streak as captain. Regarding his own eye-catching form the 22-year-old felt attitude was the key.

en.15.139.474.2009.8.10,World's first wireless pacemaker gives patient new freedom,"NEW YORK, Mon Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After relying on a pacemaker for 20 years, Carol Kasyjanski has become the world's first recipient of a wireless pacemaker that allows her doctor to monitor her health from afar -- over the Internet. When Kasyjanski heads to St. Francis Hospital in Rosyln, New York, for a routine check-up, about 90 percent of the work has already been done because her doctor logged into his computer and learned most of what he needed to know about his patient. Three weeks ago Kasyjanski, 61, became the first person in the world to be implanted with a pacemaker with a wireless home monitoring system that transmits critical information to her doctor via the Internet. Kasyjanski, who has suffered from a severe heart condition for more than 20 years, says the device has given her renewed confidence and a new lease of life, because if her pacemaker were to malfunction or stop working, only immediate action would save her life. ""Years ago the problem was with my lead, it was nicked, and until I collapsed no one knew what the problem was, no tests would show what the problem was until I passed out,"" she told Reuters Television. Dr. Steven Greenberg, the director of St. Francis' Arrhythmia and Pacemaker Center, said the new technology helps him better treat his patients and will likely become the new standard in pacemakers. He said the server and the remote monitor communicate at least once a day to download all the relevant information and alert the doctor and patient if there is anything unusual. ""If there is anything abnormal, and we have a very intricate system set up, it will literally call the physician responsible at two in the morning if need be,"" he said. The wireless pacemaker, made by St. Jude Medical Inc., received FDA approval in July. ""It is a tremendous convenience for the patient from even interacting with a telephone to call the doctor,"" he said. ""On a larger scale it enhances our ability to pick up and evaluate any problems with their pacemaker and certain other rhythm disorders that could be potentially dangerous or life threatening in ways we really could do before."" Kasyjanski, an account clerk, said it was frightening initially to be the first person to be implanted with the device but her fears have slowly been replaced by a sense of relief, knowing that her heart is under constant surveillance. ""Deep down I feel like I have gotten another chance,"" she said. ""Right now I feel like this is a new lease on life and I am here for my two children and my grandchildren and, God willing, I will be here for many more years to come."" There are more than 3 million people internationally with pacemakers and 600,000 more are implanted each year. Greenburg said wireless technology was likely to become far more common in patient care, and give physicians time to focus more on their patients as opposed to routine tests. ""In the future, these pacemakers may be placed not just for people with slow heartbeats. We may be monitoring high blood pressure, we may be measuring glucose, we may be monitoring heart failure,"" he said, ""There are literally dozens of physiological parameters that now, with this wireless technology, we can leverage for the future of monitoring. So it is not just a rhythm monitor but a disease monit"

en.15.139.121.2009.8.13,Consistency the key to Liverpool's title hopes,"LIVERPOOL, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool have cashed in on midfielder Xabi Alonso and their lack of financial muscle means they have been unable to compete for stellar signings like Valencia striker David Villa. However, manager Rafa Benitez remains convinced he can end a three-season trophy drought at Anfield and deliver the prize the fans crave the most. Next May will represent the 20th anniversary since the Merseyside club last won the league title, far too long for a team of Liverpool's traditions. They lost only two league games last season yet were still forced to settle for runners-up spot. ""We are strong enough to beat anyone but we need to be consistent,"" said Benitez as he prepared for his sixth season in charge at Anfield. ""We got 86 points last season, a record for the club in the Premier League, but we still need to improve. We have a lot of confidence."" Consistency will be the key for Liverpool. Despite losing two fewer games than champions Manchester United, it was too many home draws that did for them last season and Benitez knows they cannot afford a repeat. SHREWD INVESTMENTS Their transfer budget is dwarfed by United, Manchester City and Chelsea but Benitez appears to have made two shrewd investments, full back Glen Johnson from Portsmouth and midfielder Alberto Aquilani from AS Roma. Aquilani, once he has recovered from a damaged ankle, does though face a tough challenge to fill the void left by the 30 million pounds ($49.31 million) sale of Alonso to Real Madrid. Liverpool's title hopes may also rest on Benitez concentrating on his side instead of allowing himself to become distracted by United. The Anfield club's 2008-09 season seemed to suffer after Benitez launched an outspoken attack on Alex Ferguson in January, saying United's manager was above punishment by soccer's governing bodies. That sparked a bitter war of words between the pair and it was Ferguson who enjoyed the last laugh by clinching the title for the third successive season. The fitness of England midfielder Steven Gerrard and Spain striker Fernando Torres is also key to Liverpool's ambitions. Injuries meant the pair started only 14 Premier League matches together last season. If Gerrard and Torres stay fit, Liverpool's long wait for the title could soon be"

A preliminary investigation by a team of nuclear scientists failed to detect any radioactive presence on board the ship carrying a huge sugar consignment, Ashok Chand, a senior police officer in India's Andaman and Nicobar islands, told Reuters. ""There will be more checking today and we will open the hatch to check the entire consignment for any radioactive material,"" Chand said. The MV Mu San dropped anchor off Hut Bay island in the Andaman islands on Wednesday without permission and was detained by the coastguard after a more than six-hour chase. U.N. member states are authorised to inspect North Korean sea, air and land cargo, and seize and destroy any goods transported in violation of a Security Council resolution in June following the North's nuclear tests. ""India is strictly following the rules and has the right to ask ships to be inspected to ensure that they are in compliance with the U.N. resolution,"" said Uday Bhaskar, Director of the National Maritime Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank. North Korean sales of missiles and other weapons materials to tense or unstable parts of the world have long been a major concern of the United States and its allies. Indian officials said they were trying to find whether the MV Mu San was anywhere near Myanmar, which is suspected to be seeking help from North Korea to build a nuclear reactor. A former Indian diplomat said New Delhi was wary of a possible North Korea-Myanmar nuclear cooperation and had therefore stepped up security near the Andaman islands, which is close to Myanmar. ""With increasing reports of North Korea helping Myanmar build a nuclear reactor, any vessel floating in Indian waters without a possible reason will be checked and India is rightly concerned,"" said Naresh Chandra, a former envoy to Washington. A full interrogation of the 39-member crew can only begin after the arrival of a Korean interpreter later on Monday, officials said. North Korea, which has walked out of six-party talks aimed at reining in its nuclear weapons programme, fired a barrage of short-range missiles in launch tests in May and exploded a nuclear device on May 25, resulting in tougher U.N. sanctions that it has ignored. Experts say North Korea are feeling the blows from U.N. sanctions and could face more international pressure. ""North Korea is realising that the eyes of the world are on them and they are feeling the blows from U.N. sanctions,"" said Lee Sang-hyun, director of the security studies programme at the Sejong Institute think tank, located near Seoul. ""They will have to be careful because this incident shows that they are feeling more pressure from countries around the world,"" Sang-hyun added."

Aquilani, 26, was unveiled by Liverpool on Thursday and immediately set his sights on helping his new club win the title for the first time in 20 years. But it is the prospect of appearing with Gerrard that really excites the Italy international midfielder, a 20 million pound buy from Roma. ""Even before I came to Liverpool I thought Steven Gerrard was the strongest midfielder in the world,"" Aquilani told reporters. ""I'm looking forward to playing with him and learning from him."" Liverpool fans will have to wait between one and two months to see the new signing in action because Aquilani is recovering from an ankle injury. Benitez said Aquilani was not a direct replacement for Xabi Alonso, who has joined Real Madrid.

He had come under widespread criticism from the domestic media and former players, who also demanded major changes in the Pakistan Cricket Board's setup and asked the senior team management to take responsibility for the defeats. Younis has instead hit back at those who suggested he should step down. ""I accept the responsibility of defeat, but will not apologise to anyone nor will I resign as captain because it's part of the game to lose and win,"" Younis was quoted as saying by the Pakistan daily Jang. ""I am trying my level best to lead the team and achieve the best results but some people want me to relinquish the captaincy, which I won't. Am I not a good captain or do I lack leadership qualities?"" Pakistan lost the three-Test series 0-2 and surrendered the ODI series with their third consecutive loss in the five-match series before saving face with wins in the last two ODIs. Younis singled out those two wins as proof that Pakistan could do well in Sri Lanka. ""We won the last two one-day matches by huge margins, and it proved that the team had the capacity and the talent to win the Tests and one-day matches,"" he said. ""But due to the batsmen's inconsistency, we failed to finish properly."" Younis, who returned to Pakistan after the ODI series, had earlier blamed a weak domestic setup as the reason for below-par performances in Sri Lanka. Reiterating that 'groupism' within the team had nothing to do with the team's poor showing on tour, Younis defended Pakistan's unity. ""There were no differences in the team. In fact I can say that the team was never as united as it was during the Sri Lanka tour,"" he said. Responding to accusations of match-fixing, Younis said: ""Baseless allegations are affecting the team's performances. No one should doubt my integrity. I can never resort to any wrongdo"
en.15.139.102.2009.8.10,Ancelotti turns his attention to season opener,"LONDON, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti said he was ready for the start of the season after marking his first competitive game in charge with a penalty-shootout victory over Manchester United in the Community Shield on Sunday. ""I think that I'm very happy, it was an important match and a very difficult match,"" the Italian, Chelsea's fifth manager in less than two years, told reporters after his side won 4-1 on spot kicks at the end of a 2-2 draw at Wembley. ""They had a very strong start to the game and we found it very difficult to play in the first half. But we played better after that and we deserved to win. ""It's an important start to the season because we have changed the way the team plays a bit. I'm very happy not only for this month but also for this past month. ""I now know the players, I like their mental attitude and I like the organisation of the club. We're ready to start a very important season for us and we are ready to do our best."" Ancelotti's attempt to wrestle the Premier League title away from United begins on Saturday when they host Hull City. The Italian, who had great success as a player and coach with AC Milan, winning two Champions Leagues and a Serie A title during his eight years in charge at the San Siro, said beating United was always important, whatever the occasion. ""The match was balanced,"" he said. ""Maybe they were a little bit better in the first half and Chelsea were a little bit better in the second half. ""Manchester are our most important opponents in the Premiership because they are a great team, they have great experience. So this gives us a bit more trust. ""But now the game is finished we have to think of the season and the next matches."" Ancelotti played down the controversy over Chelsea's second goal, scored by Frank Lampard when United defender Patrice Evra had been flattened by a crude bodycheck by Michael Ballack. With referee Chris Foy waving play on, United's players expected Chelsea to kick the ball into touch but instead Didier Drogba surged towards goal before picking out Lampard to put Chelsea 2-1 ahead with 20 minutes remaining. ""The referee can stop the play and also the players can put the ball out,"" Ancelotti said. ""But they didn't see Evra on the pitch so they continued ... for sure if they had seen him on the pitch they would have put the ball"

More than 50 people have died in tropical storms striking the Phillipines, Taiwan, China and Japan. The death toll so far in Taiwan stood at 15, with 55 missing and 32 hurt, since Typhoon Morakot struck the island on Friday and remained in the area through the weekend before battering China's populous east coast. Rescue squads aboard helicopters had saved only 45 people from Hsiao Lin, a village of 1,000 in southern Taiwan. Rains washed out roads and bridges in Kaohsiung County, severing all land vehicle traffic. ""No small number of single-storey houses have been covered in mudslides,"" said Richard Hu, an army major-general. ""We don't know how many people are there, but homes have definitely been buried."" Local officials said they had lost contact with up to 600 villagers, with inclement weather reducing even helicopter access. The storm caused floods in Taiwan's densely-populated south and farm-related losses on the island were estimated at T$4.2 billion ($128 million). Morakot killed 22 people in the Philippines. In China, it damaged more than 1,800 houses in the province of Zhejiang and killed at least one child, the official Xinhua news agency said. One million people were evacuated in China before the storm made landfall and losses were estimated at 2.2 billion yuan ($322 million. ETAU HEADS FOR JAPAN In Japan, tropical storm Etau was fast approaching and more than 47,000 residents of western regions were told to leave their homes, national broadcaster NHK reported. At least 12 people were killed in Hyogo, western Japan, a police official said, while providing no further details. A 68-year-old woman was killed when a mudslide hit a house in Okayama, western Japan. ""The water flashed by in just in a moment,"" a man told NHK. ""I was holding on to the power pole and waiting for an hour and a half."" Domestic flights and train services were cancelled and some highways partially closed, NHK said. The Japan Meteorological Agency said on its Website (www.jma.go.jp) that the storm could hit central Japan on Tuesday. Rain, floods, mudslides, heavy seas and winds gusting to 126 kph (78 mph) were expected in many regions. Tropical storms and typhoons regularly hit Japan, China Taiwan and the Philippines in the second half of the year, gathering strength from the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean before weakening over land."
en.15.139.157.2009.8.13,Warning of 'preludes' to disaster as Indian Ocean shaken again,"Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  As the Indian Ocean shook for a second time this week, the head of the Earth Observatory at Dhaka University warned on Thursday that Bangladesh could be teetering on the verge of an earthquake disaster with two abutting tectonic plates heading for a clash, and a high risk too of being inundated by a tidal wave. The warning came as three quakes had shaken the region within 72 hours. A major 7.6 quake off the Andamans in the Indian Ocean triggered a tsunami alert on Tuesday and a medium 5.6 tremor jolted northern districts in Bangladesh on Wednesday. ""Bangladesh is an earthquake prone area due to her geological and tectonic structures, especially Sylhet, Chittagong and Chittagong Hill Tract areas,"" geology professor Syed Humayun Akhter, also in charge of the Earth Observatory at Dhaka University, told bdnews24.com on Thursday. As he was speaking, the Indian Ocean shook again near the Andaman and Nicobar islands. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department told bdnews24.com that a moderate quake of magnitude 5.6 registered at 4:21:83pm local time, with its epicentre 979 km south-southeast of Dhaka in the Indian Ocean. There was no tsunami alert this time, he added. The northern region of Bangladesh lies above the seam of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates and the eastern part is above the joint of the Burmese and Indian plates. The Indian plate is edging north-east while the Burmese plate is moving north-west, say experts. Besides, the country is perched on three faults and a seismic gap. If an earthquake of more than 8 on the Richter scale occurs in Bangladesh or in India's Meghalaya, Assam, Manipur, Mizoram states or in Myanmar, the trail of damage will be colossal, said Akhter. The most at-risk areas in Bangladesh are over the Tangail-Modhupur fault, Sylhet's Dauki fault, Sitakundu-Teknaf fault Another major concern is the north-Andaman-Teknaf subduction zone, or seismic gap. Tsunami risk ""A seismic gap of 600 kilometres in the Bay of Bengal from north Andaman to Teknaf contains enough energy to cause an earthquake measuring over 7.5 in the Richter scale,"" said Prof Akhter. The Indian Ocean quake on Tuesday, Aug 11, occurred in the Andaman-Teknaf subduction zone. ""It shows the subduction zone is active and could generate a devastating tsunami in the near future,"" said Akhter. On Dec 26, 2004, a massive underwater quake measuring 9.3 caused a huge tidal wave or tsunami in the western Bay of Bengal. It was the second biggest earthquake recorded in the region and was caused by friction between the Indian and Burmese plates. Bangladesh was safe during the 2004 tsunami because the direction of the friction was north-south giving rise to a east-west moving wave. But the fracture of the Teknaf-Andaman seismic gap is along a north-east to south-west direction. If a tsunami is generated in the Bay of Bengal from this subduction zone, it will directly assail the coastal areas including Barisal, Patuakhali, Noakhali, Cox's Bazar and Snadwip and India's Orissa, West Bengal, said Akhter. ""Our coast is only 750 km away from Teknaf-Andaman seismic gap. A tsunami generated there will take only one hour to reach the coast and the impact will be colossal because of the low plain lands of Bangladesh,"" he said. 'Preludes to serious quake' A few hundred minor earthquakes in different parts of the country in recent years can also be seen as preludes to a serious one, said Akhter. The earthquake on December 20, 2000, near capital Dhaka indicated that a major earthquake is on its way, he said, adding that unplanned urbanisation in Dhaka and other cities would lead to catastrophic loss of life. ""Around a dozen quakes recorded at the Modhupur fault in September last year are also deemed as foreshocks of a major quake,"" said Akhter. ""The devastating earthquakes in Pakistan and Sumatra over the last few years are a warning bell for us too,"" said Akhter. Besides mountainous areas, there are many faults in plain lands too, he said. ""Most areas of the country consist of low plain lands and soft silt. If a major earthquake occurs the disaster will be a calamitous liquefaction,"" he said. Roger Bilham, geology professor at the Colorado University of USA, has also confirmed seismic gaps in a number of places at the foot of the Himalayas and predicted several earthquakes measuring 7 and 8 Richter scale in the region in the near future. Clashes have been more frequent in recent times between the Indian and Eurasian plates and the Burmese and Indian plates. The Indian plate lies under Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh is located at a joint of a part of the Indian plate and three other plates in the north-east. The first earthquake to be properly recorded in Bangladesh was in 1548. A major quake struck the Chittagong-Burma coast in 1762 that caused a number of islands to sink into the Bay of Bengal and sprouted two mud-volcanoes at Sitakundu Hill and Teknaf that rose 1.5 to 2 metres above the sea level. ""Probably, the 1762 earthquake was the first recorded underwater quake in this region giving rise to a tsunami,"" said Akhter. Bangladesh has seen six earthquakes measuring 7 or more on the Richter scale since records began, in Sylhet, Srimangal, Manikganj and Chittagong. Generally an earthquake below 5 in magnitude occurs every one and a half years. A major earthquake occurs after 100 years. ""An earthquake is hard to forecast like any other natural disasters. But we can minimise the impact by increasing awareness,"" he said. The overall preparation of the earthquake can be divided into three parts  pre-quake preparation, preparation during the quake and post-quake preparation. Akhter suggested preparing seismotectonic maps to earmark earthquake prone areas, collecting data on regular tremors and upgrading the national building code. Training on earthquake preparedness in schools and rehearsals on self-defence will also be useful, he said. bdnew"
en.15.139.353.2009.8.10,Marico IPO closes hugely oversubscribed,"Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com business correspondent Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)The initial public offering of Marico Bangladesh Limited, well known for its market leader Parachute Coconut Oil, closed on Monday, with subscription of more than six times the issue target. MBL, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mumbai-based Marico Limited India, is looking to raise around Tk 27 crore from the local capital market through the floatation of almost 3,000,000 shares. ""According to our figures, in Dhaka and Chittagong alone Tk 180 crore worth of the subscriptions were submitted till yesterday (Aug 9),"" Iqbal Chowdhury, the secretary of MBL, told bdnews24.com on Monday. The Securities and Exchange Commission last month cleared Marico to issue 1,492,100 ordinary shares, as the company sought initially to raise Tk 13.42 crore to repay outstanding loans of with several local commercial banks. The offer price of each share was fixed at Tk 90, with a face-value of Tk 10 and premium of Tk 80 created massive demand from investors when the subscription opened on Aug 2. On Aug 5, the market regulator agreed to double the size of the IPO, and extended its subscription deadline under a 'green shoe option', legally known as an over-allotment option, in which underwriters seek to stabilise the IPO. The scheme allows a company to float more shares than stated in the prospectus if oversubscribed, SEC executive director Anwarul Kabir Bhuiyan told bdnews24.com last week. ""They sought permission to increase their IPO against the backdrop of investors' appetite for the issue,"" said Bhuiyan. MBL began operating in 2000, with an authorised and paid-up capital of Tk 1 crore. Its flagship brand Parachute Coconut Oil now holds over 70 percent of the market share of branded coconut oils in Bangladesh. Over the last 8 years, the company has developed an annual growth rate of 37 percent in turnover. In the 2008 FY, MBL's turnover reached almost Tk 265 crore, from Tk 20 crore in the 2001 FY. In 2005, MBL expanded its foothold in the household soap sector, when it acquired the intellectual rights to well-known local brands, Camelia and Aromatic. It re-launched Aromatic under the name 'Aromatic Gold', but failed to gain traction against the major players, presently taking about 4 percent of the market. Parent company Marico Limited India is a global concern with business interests in manufacturing and retailing personal consumer products as well as providing services in the beauty industry.

en.15.139.174.2009.8.11,Netanyahu warns Lebanon over Hezbollah power-share,"JERUSALEM, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel will hold Lebanon responsible for any future Hezbollah attack should the Iranian- and Syrian-backed militia be brought into Beirut's incoming government, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday. Though US-backed Lebanese Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri bested Hezbollah in a June ballot, he is holding talks on a new coalition expected to include the Shi'ite group and its allies. Hezbollah has a minister in the outgoing cabinet. Israel fought Hezbollah in its southern Lebanese bastions in a 2006 war but has accused the guerrillas of rearming under the noses of UN peacekeepers and plotting attacks on Israelis to avenge the assassination of a top militia leader last year. Some analysts believe that Israel, which has hinted it could attack arch-foe Iran's nuclear facilities, also wants to blunt Hezbollah's ability to serve as a retaliatory arm of Tehran. ""If Hezbollah joins the Lebanese government as an official entity, let it be clear that the Lebanese government, as far as we are concerned, is responsible for any attack -- any attack -- from its area on the state of Israel,"" Netanyahu told reporters. ""It cannot hide and say: 'It's Hezbollah, we don't control them.'"" Triggered by Hezbollah's capture of two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid, the 2006 summer war exacted a heavy toll on Lebanese infrastructure. Some 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 158 Israelis, mostly soldiers, were killed. BORDERLINE CALM Israel credits the offensive with keeping the border largely quiet since, but Hezbollah has said it is ready to fight again and is determined to hit back for the February 12, 2008 killing of its military mastermind, Imad Moughniyeh, in a Damascus car-bombing. Israel denied involvement in that slaying, and has warned that Hezbollah and Lebanon would bear the consequences for any reprisals against Israelis abroad. Netanyahu's threat followed similar comments by the Israeli defense minister and deputy foreign minister in recent days. The spiraling rhetoric has stirred speculation on both sides of the frontier that a fresh conflict could be in the making. Senior Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hashim Safieddin said on Sunday that if Israel attacked Lebanon again, the group's response would make the 2006 war seem like ""a joke,"" Lebanese media reported. Underlining the point Monday, deputy Hezbollah leader Sheikh Naim Kassem said Israel would face a ""heavy"" price if it attacked. ""They know that we now are in a better position (than before) and in an excellent state of readiness,"" he told the group's al-Manar television station. Asked about Netanyahu's remarks, Deputy Israeli Prime Minister Dan Meridor said they were intended to preserve the quiet through deterrence. But he also made clear that Israel regards its neighbor as a potential Iranian proxy. ""Hezbollah is a terror organization that has become a semi-army. Basically, it is a branch of Iran on our northern border, with Syria's consent and with Lebanon's consent. This is not a healthy phenomenon,"" Meridor told Israel Radio. Assumed to have the Middle East's only atomic arsenal, Israel has questioned the efficacy of US-led efforts to curb Iran's nuclear program through diplomacy. Iran denies seeking the bomb but has stoked regional jitters with virulently anti-Israel statements and support for Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamist militants similarly arrayed against the Jewish s"

en.15.139.335.2009.8.12,Costa Rican president has swine flu,"SAN JOSE, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Costa Rican President Oscar Arias is suffering from the H1N1 virus, making him the first head of state known to have contracted swine flu. Nobel Peace Prize winner Arias, 68, has a mild case of the virus which he tested positive for on on Tuesday after feeling unwell at the weekend, the government said. Arias is at home and plans to do some work from there. ""Apart from the fever and a soar throat, I feel well and in good shape to carry out my work by telecommuting. I expect to return to all my duties on Monday,"" he said in a statement. The H1N1 flu outbreak, declared a pandemic on June 11, has spread around the world since emerging in April and could eventually affect 2 billion people, according to estimates by the U.N. World Health Organization. More than 20 people have died of swine flu in Costa Rica. Arias suffers from asthma. While the vast majority of swine flu cases have not been serious, infected people who have other medical conditions are most susceptible to complications. ""The tests ... show that there is no other complication,"" Information Minister Mayi Antillon said. Some of the president's duties have been given to Cabinet ministers for the moment. Last month, Arias brokered talks to try to end a political crisis in Honduras after President Manuel Zelaya was ousted in a coup on June 28. Negotiations broke down two weeks ago over whether Zelaya can return to power and Arias' illness is unlikely to affect the situation in Honduras. Arias won the Nobel prize in 1987 for a peace plan to end Central American civil wars and guerrilla conflicts. He first served as president from 1986-90 and was re-elected in 2006 on a promise to end corruption and take the small country into a Central American free trade pact with the United States. Arias broke Costa Rica's decades-old diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 2007 to establish ties with rival Beijing, saying his country could no longer ignore China's growing power in the world. Doctors ordered Arias last year to stop talking for a month due to a vocal chord ailment. He communicated by writing and typing."

England manager Fabio Capello has already said the Los Angeles Galaxy player must return to a top European championship to have any hope making his squad for South Africa, prompting the winger to seek another stint in Serie A. Originally overlooked by Capello, the 34-year-old won back his England place during a successful loan period at Milan in the second half of last term.

The quake, which struck around 3am Bangladesh time, triggered the tsunami alert by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre for India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia and Thailand. On-duty official Abdur Rahman of Meteorology Department told bdnews24.com that the tsunami alert was withdrawn around 7am. No tsunami was reported from the coastal areas, but people close to the coastal belt were asked to move with caution until 8:30am. Rahman had earlier told bdnews24.com that the quake, which was felt at 2:55:42am Bangladesh time, had its epicentre 980 kilometres south-southeast of the Dhaka Met Office. Many in capital Dhaka, Chittagong and other places were shaken out of their sleep in the wee hours by tremors. Banker Reisuddin Ahmed, a resident of Uttara told bdnews24.com he felt two tremor,s at 2:55 am for a few seconds and 3am for another few seconds. ""The furniture shook both times,"" he said. Lalmatia resident Khairul Alam told bdnews24.com he was jolted out of his sleep at around 3am after his bed shook. ""Many people in my building went out onto the streets in panic."" At least 3 people were reported injured in Moheshkhali, Cox's Bazar, as a wall collapsed on them. Nearer the epicentre, Reuters correspondent Sanjit Kumar Roy in Port Blair, capital of the Andaman Islands, said that in the northern part of the island, people ran out of their houses in panic. ""[My] room shook for around 20 to 30 seconds, it was quite strong."" The US Geological Survey said the quake, initially reported as a magnitude 7.7, struck off the Andamans at 1:55 am local time (1955 GMT on Monday). It was shallow, at a depth of 20.6 miles, and was centered 160 miles north of Port Blair. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center immediately issued a tsunami watch for the region. ""Earthquakes of this size have the potential to generate a destructive local tsunami and sometimes a destructive regional tsunami along coasts located usually no more than a thousand kilometers (about 600 miles) from the earthquake epicenter,"" the tsunami center said in its bulletin. However, an official at the Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services said a tsunami warning had not been issued by his department. ""We have not issued a tsunami alert and are monitoring the water level changes in the region at the moment,"" Ajay Kumar told Reuters by phone. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a chain of small islands hundreds of miles east of India in the Indian Ocean.

Of all the tournaments staged since ATP rankings began in 1973, Montreal marks the first that the world's top eight have fought their way to the quarter-finals of the same event. Friday's high quality line-up will include players from eight different countries, four past champions and four Grand Slam winners. Among them, only American world number five Andy Roddick has not claimed multiple titles this season. ""It's actually a little bit easier here because the top eight had a bye, but at the same time it's not just the top eight seeds it's the top eight ranked players in the world,"" Federer told reporters. ""It's definitely a special occasion. ""It just shows the top guys now are really consistent and they're showing up at the big events,"" the Swiss world number one added. ""It's nice it finally happened."" Joining Federer and Roddick are world number two Rafael Nadal of Spain, Briton Andy Murray (3), Serbia's Novak Djokovic (4), Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro (6), Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France (7) and Russian Nikolai Davydenko (8). JOINING THE PARTY Federer, playing in his first event since clinching a record 15th Grand Slam title at Wimbledon last month, was last to join the party, but his attendance was never seriously threatened by Wawrinka, his partner for doubles gold at the 2008 Beijing Games. After surrendering the first set, the Swiss number two fluffed a chance to break Federer in the second, and betrayed his frustration by blasting a ball out of the stadium. Big-hitting Tsonga stands in the way of a semi-final berth for Federer, the Frenchman advancing with a 6-3, 6-3 win over compatriot Giles Simon. Defending champion Nadal gave his knees a proper work-out in an energetic 6-3, 6-2 win over Germany's Philipp Petzschner, and showed his delight with a buoyant post-game dance around Centre Court amid wild applause from fans. ""A little better, the movement was a little better,"" said Nadal, who had been sidelined for two months with tendonitis in both knees prior to Montreal. ""I am happy because I am in the quarter-finals and it is more than I expected when I came here."" Nadal can expect a much sterner test against Del Potro, who is in superb hard-court form after winning the Washington Classic last week. The Argentine did it tough in his third-round match with Victor Hanescu of Romania, however, coming back from a set down to win 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. Murray's hardcourt campaign moved into top gear with a 6-1, 6-3 win over resurgent Juan Carlos Ferrero, denying the Spaniard revenge for his quarter-final defeat at Wimbledon. Playing his first event since falling to Roddick in the Wimbledon semi-finals, Murray knocked the last bit of rust off his game to blast past Ferrero in just 77 minutes. Murray next meets Davydenko, a 7-6, 7-5 winner over Chile's Fernando Gonzalez. Unlike Murray, who barely broke sweat under a blazing Canadian sun, 2003 champion Roddick was left drained after his two hour and 36 minute defeat of feisty Spaniard Fernando Verdasco 7-6, 4-6, 7-6. The win set the American up for quarter-final showdown with 2007 winner Djokovic, who beat Russian Mikhail Youzhny 6-3,"

Castro, the leader of Cuba's 1959 revolution that brought communism to the Caribbean island, has remained out of public view for the last three years and in 2008 handed over the presidency to younger brother Raul Castro for health reasons. But while he leaves day-to-day running of the government to Raul Castro, he remains influential behind the scenes and writes regular commentaries for state-run media. In a column published in the Communist Party newspaper Granma on Thursday, Fidel Castro expressed skepticism about perceptions in the United States and in Europe that the world recession may be easing. ""The tendency among American politicians is to believe that as soon as the banks make available enough money to grease the machinery of the productive apparatus, everything will be on track toward an idyllic world beyond our dreams,"" he wrote. ""Some say that the economic crisis is the end of imperialism ... Maybe it must be wondered if it does not mean something worse for our species,"" he said in the commentary. Closing his column on a more upbeat note, he said, ""In my judgment, it will always be best to have a just cause to defend and the hope to carry on."" Although he has handed over the reins to Raul Castro, who is 78, Fidel Castro has stayed defiant against what he portrays as continuing U.S. efforts to end the socialist system in Cuba he led and defended for nearly half a century. He has said Cuba will not surrender, playing down cautious steps taken this year by U.S. President Barack Obama to improve ties with Havana. Obama has said he will keep the 47-year-old U.S. trade embargo on the island to press the Cuban leadership to improve human rights and grant political freedoms. Although the two governments have agreed to talk on migration and other issues, Fidel and Raul Castro have made clear that Washington should not expect concessions from Havana, and that they will not shift Cuba to capitalism. PHOTOS SHOW FIDEL CASTRO IN GOOD HEALTH Cuba is facing its worst economic crisis since the 1990s as the global economic crisis squeezes its centralized economy, with drops in revenues from foreign currency earners such as tourism and nickel mining. In response, Raul Castro has tweaked the state-run economy with limited reforms to try to increase productivity. No major special events were held on Thursday to commemorate Fidel Castro's birthday. On Wednesday, an exhibit of 83 photographs of the former Cuban leader opened at the Hotel Nacional in Havana. The latest, said to have been taken about two weeks ago by his son Alex Castro, showed him wearing a blue baseball cap and appearing heal"

Former opening batsman Dyson played 30 Tests for Australia between 1977-84, scoring 1,359 runs at an average of 26.64. He became coach of Sri Lanka in 2003, spending almost two years there before taking the reins at West Indies in 2007. Dyson suffered embarrassment this March when West Indies miscalculated the Duckworth-Lewis target at the end of the opening one-dayer against England in Guyana. The home team, chasing a 50-over target of 270 for seven, were offered the chance to go off due to rain and bad light and Dyson beckoned the batsmen off the field. However, West Indies were one run short of the Duckworth-Lewis target, the method used to calculate results when the full overs are unused, and with no opportunity to return to the field England were declared winners with West Indies on 244 for seven from 46.2 overs. ""I was on the wrong column (on the sheet) ... I thought we were ahead of Duckworth-Lewis but in fact we were behind by one run,"" Dyson said. ""There was a lot of noise going on and it was my responsibility so that was it. I accept responsibility for it and I've apologised to the team and that's all I can do. It was my mist"

Witnesses and officials of the Islamist group Hamas which rules the enclave confirmed the pre-dawn strike. There were no reports of casualties. Gaza's smuggling tunnels, which still number in the hundreds despite air attacks and an Egyptian crackdown in which some have been blown up or flooded, are a frequent target for Israeli retaliation for attacks by Gaza's armed Palestinian groups. Monday's raid was launched in response to recent mortar and rocket attacks, an Israeli military spokeswoman said. It was the first aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip since June 18. The aircraft had targeted a tunnel under the border at Rafah which was suspected of being used to smuggle explosives into Gaza from Egypt, she added. On Sunday, two mortar rounds were fired near Israel's fortified Erez border crossing as a number of medical patients going for treatment in Israel were being ferried out by ambulance. The rounds exploded about 300 meters from the Erez wall in Palestinian territory and no one was hurt. On the day before, a rocket fired from Gaza exploded in open ground on the Israeli side of the border. Some smaller Gaza militant groups say Hamas has been trying to stop them firing rockets and mortars at Israel, which has control of the delivery of fuel and food aid to the 1.5 million Palestinians living in the enclave. Hamas wants Israel to lift its blockade and open the border crossings. Israel says Hamas must first release captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, whom it has held for three years. Israel launched a ground and air offensive in Gaza in December, in which some 1,400 Palestinians were killed. Israel said it was a response to daily rocket fire by Gaza militants directed at southern Israeli towns. Thirteen Israelis were killed in the 22-day conflict. Israel has frequently attacked tunnels it says are used to bring in weapons or materials to build weapons, though such raids have been fewer in the past couple of months. The spokeswoman said some 240 rockets had been fired by Gaza fighters since the end of the offensive on January 18."

Iran's June 12 election, which secured hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election, plunged Iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 Islamic revolution, exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite and set off a wave of protests that left 26 people dead. ""I ask UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to visit Iran,"" Ebadi told reporters in Seoul, where she picked up a local peace prize. ""He must speak to the families whose members have been arrested or killed."" Ebadi contends that more than 100 people have been killed. Ebadi, Iran's most famous human rights lawyer, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 and has called for UN observers to scrutinize a fresh vote in Iran. Her influence in Iran is seen as limited, analysts said. In an attempt to uproot the opposition, Iran began two mass trials of more than 100 people, including prominent figures, a French woman and two Iranians working for the British and French embassies in Tehran. It charged them with spying and assisting a Western plot to overthrow the clerical rule. The United States and its European allies have rejected the trials as a ""show,"" while Ebadi said they were ""ridiculous"" and must be stopped. ""The trials show that the administration is weak. These mass trials are not in line with the laws of Islam,"" she said through a translator. The United Nations has imposed three rounds of sanctions on Iran so far, but there appears to be little appetite for a fourth round. China and Russia, two of Iran's key trading partners, have made clear they will not accept new sanctions at the moment. The 27-nation European Union, meanwhile, is split on the idea of targeting Iran's energy industry.

Challenging the authority of Iran's most powerful figure Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Rafsanjani declared the Islamic republic in crisis during his last Friday prayer sermon in July and demanded an end to arrests of moderates. After Rafsanjani's sermon on July 17, clashes erupted between police and followers of opposition leader Mirhossein Mousavi, who says the June vote was rigged to secure the re-election of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. ""To avoid any possible clashes at Friday prayers, he will not lead the prayers this week,"" the office of Rafsanjani, also the head of the Assembly of Experts, said in a statement, the Etemad daily reported. The June 12 presidential vote plunged Iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 Islamic revolution and exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite. Rights groups say hundreds of people, including senior pro-reform politicians, journalists, activists and lawyers, have been detained by the authorities since the election. Iranian official media have said at least 26 people died in violence after the poll. Rafsanjani, an architect of the Islamic revolution, has warned the post-election power struggle would harm the establishment. Reformist former president Mohammad Khatami, defeated candidates Mehdi Karoubi and Mousavi have denounced Ahmadinejad's new government as ""illegitimate"". Ahmadinejad was officially sworn in on Wednesday. In an attempt to uproot the opposition and to end street protests, Iran held two mass trials of moderates, including several prominent figures, charged with offences that included acting against national security by fomenting unrest. An Iranian Revolutionary Court on Saturday charged a French woman, two Iranians working for the British and French embassies in Tehran and dozens of others with spying and aiding a Western plot to overthrow the clerical rule. Espionage and acting against national security are punishable by death under Iran's Islamic law. Rafsanjani is one of the four rotating Friday prayer leaders in Teh"
en.15.139.245.2009.8.14,Bolt seeks new sort of yam power for world title bid,"BERLIN, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Usain Bolt's love affair with the yam will literally step up a level on Saturday when the Jamaican starts his World Championship campaign in newly-designed glitzy orange spikes named after the humble root vegetable. After Bolt's triple gold and world record success at last year's Olympics his father said that the locally-grown yams had been a staple for his son, and Bolt junior said on Thursday that he still had a soft spot for them. In recognition of the fact, his shoe sponsor, Puma, have shod their prize asset in yam orange as he goes for another hat-trick of golds. Even the venue for the launch was called the YAAM club, though it turned out to have nothing to do with Bolt's favourite tuber and stood instead for Young African Art Market. Less impressive than the spikes were the giant foam arms shaped to mimic Bolt's trademark celebratory pose with which he lumbered on to the stage for Thursday's news conference. ""I'm ready and I've got some new stuff,"" said the Jamaican, proudly holding up his footwear and, as ever, seeming completely relaxed two days before starting his 100 metres campaign. ""I don't really enjoy all this stuff but I know it comes with being a champion so I try to be cool with it,"" he said. ""I just want to run, I'm just itching to. I've been training hard, I've put the work in and I'm fully fit. I'm confident, but not too confident."" After his astonishing performances in Beijing, Bolt knows that everyone who lines up against him, even double defending sprint champion Tyson Gay, will have half an eye on his yellow vest. NO WORRIES For his part, Bolt said he would continue to stay loose and enjoy the crowd interaction that has helped propel him to superstardom in the sport. ""I know what I'm out there for, the time to get focussed is when the starter says 'get set',"" he said. ""The crowd is fun and it's also fun to see some of the guys at the line. They are really tense but there are no worries for me, I've done it hundreds of times."" Gay, who has the world's best times over 100 and 200 metres this season, will be sure to keep Bolt honest but the Jamaican said that there had been no talk of world records. ""I've set a standard to myself and want to live up to it but you never know what will be good enough to win -- the last worlds was won 9.85 (by Gay in Osaka in 2007),"" he said. ""I'm just focussed on getting the championship. Maybe next season when there is no championship we can focus on times."" Bolt said recent problems in the Jamaican camp, such as the missed training session that led to a threat to expel former 100 metres world record holder Asafa Powell and the positive drugs tests of five team members, would not affect their chances of adding the sprint relay world title to the Olympic gold. ""We have a good team, everybody is here,"" he said. ""We are looking good in practice and I'm not worr"
en.15.139.452.2009.8.11,"""Three amigos"" talk trade, H1N1 in Mexico","GUADALAJARA, Mexico, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leaders of the United States, Mexico and Canada vowed on Monday to fight the spread of the H1N1 swine flu and combat climate change but differed on trade disputes at their ""three amigos"" summit. US President Barack Obama, Mexican President Felipe Calderon and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper met against a backdrop of an economic downturn in each country with a US rebound key to a regional improvement. Obama and Harper said their governments would share information as each faces the possibility of a predicted upsurge in the H1N1 virus this autumn. ""H1N1, as we know, will be back this winter,"" Calderon said at a joint news conference. ""We are getting prepared, all three countries, to face in a responsible manner this contingency and abate its impacts for our people."" All three leaders vowed to respect the North American Free Trade Agreement that unites their countries in trade, but differed on some issues. Harper raised with Obama Canada's concerns about the ""Buy American"" provisions in the $787 billion U.S. economic stimulus plan that the Canadians fear could shut out Canadian companies. Canada is the United States' largest trading partner. Obama said it was important to keep in perspective the fact that no sweeping protectionist measures have been imposed and that the ""Buy American"" provisions were limited to the stimulus and have ""in no way endangered the billions of dollars in trade between our two countries."" Calderon, who is trying to persuade Obama to resolve a cross-border trucking dispute to allow Mexican trucks to transit into the United States, said all three leaders believe it is essential to abide by NAFTA and to ""resolve the pending topics"" impeding greater regional competitiveness. Obama had made clear to Calderon that he was working with the US Congress to resolve what he considers to be legitimate safety concerns with Mexican trucks. He said the United States, Mexico and Canada should take steps to avoid protectionism, saying ""we need to expand that trade, not restrict it."" The three leaders issued a statement on joint efforts to combat climate change with an eye toward a global summit on the topic in Copenhagen in November.

en.15.139.489.2009.8.12,New-look City begin challenge to join the elite,"LONDON, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If newly rich Manchester City wanted to rile Manchester United during the close-season they certainly went about it the right way -- and not just by spending over 100 million pounds on new players. The arrivals of Carlos Tevez from United, Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Toure from Arsenal, Roque Santa Cruz from Blackburn and Gareth Barry from Aston Villa should certainly see City improve in the new Premier League season starting this weekend. However, it is not the signings themselves that have got under the skin of Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson, who is plotting a title defence without world player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo, sold to Real Madrid, as well as Tevez. What really rankles at Old Trafford is City's assertion that they are about to challenge for a place in the top four, and ultimately United's position as the biggest club in England. City tweaked United's nose when a huge banner was erected in the city centre showing Tevez in a City shirt with the slogan ""Welcome to Manchester"" underneath his photograph -- a cheeky reference to the fact that United's home of Old Trafford is actually situated in Salford, outside Manchester city limits. ""They are a small club with a small mentality,"" responded Ferguson. ""All they can talk about is Manchester United."" He continued: ""It will not be easy for City this season, and for me they don't even come into the top four equation. For all the buying they have done, Mark Hughes still has to find the right balance, and what's he got -- 1O strikers?"" Since Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan took control of City last year, manager Hughes has spent over 220 million pounds on new players, including the British record 32.5 million he paid for Brazilian Robinho at the start of last season. Anything other than a top four finish will be regarded as a failure at City, who last mounted a realistic title bid in 1976-77 when they finished as runners-up to Liverpool. They have not won a major trophy since the League Cup in 1976 and since returning to the Premier League in 2002, their best finishing position was eighth in 2005. Hughes, a former United hero under Ferguson in the 1980s and 1990s, is under no illusions about what is expected of him. He told reporters recently: ""I remember the pressure Alex Ferguson was under when I was a United player and he went four years before winning the FA Cup. The first trophy is the hardest. Then success becomes a natural thing because you have experienced how to achieve it. ""I know the pressure I am under. The owners want to take this club into the top four and Champions League very quickly."" SCORING TOUCH To do that City will have to dislodge either United, Chelsea, Liverpool or Arsenal and only one team -- Everton in 2004-05 -- have managed to do that in the last six seasons. Despite the loss of Tevez to City and Ronaldo to Real, for a world record fee of 80 million pounds, United can be confident they have some outstanding young players coming through. If free signing Michael Owen rediscovers his old scoring touch alongside Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov, the effect of Ronaldo's absence and his goal contribution will be diluted. United are bidding for a fourth successive title -- never before achieved in English soccer -- and will also be targeting a third successive Champions League final. Chelsea, under new coach Carlo Ancelotti, were given a huge boost when skipper John Terry spurned City's advances and pledged his future to the club in the summer. Although Chelsea's position as England's richest club has now been assumed by City, Ancelotti has inherited an experienced side desperate to build on last season's FA Cup success and win the league for the first time since 2006. Liverpool, runners-up last season, strengthened the squad by signing England defender Glenn Johnson and coach Rafa Benitez has replaced Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso, sold to Real Madrid, with the Italian Alberto Aquilani. Arsenal have been quiet in the transfer market with Thomas Vermaelen from Ajax Amsterdam their only major arrival so far. Arsene Wenger allowed Adebayor and Toure to leave for City for a reported total of 41 million pounds and he could yet add to his squad, still one of the most powerful in the division. The challenge for Europa League places should involve City -- at the very least -- and the usual ""second tier"" clubs like Everton, Aston Villa, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United. Burnley, back in the top flight for the first time since 1976, dream of re-establishing themselves as one of country's top clubs but more realistically they will be among those hoping to avoid relegation come next May. Hull City, Stoke City, Portsmouth and promoted Birmingham City and Wolverhampton Wanderers are likely to be in the same"

However, the parliamentary standing committee on communications ministry stopped short of making final recommendations on the Indian route for the hook-up to the 141,000 kilometres of standardised roadways crisscrossing 32 Asian countries with linkages to Europe. Nazrul Islam Manju, the lone member of the main opposition BNP, did not oppose the suggestions of the standing committee dominated by ruling Awami League MPs. The BNP says the Asian Highway must enter Bangladesh from India and then connect China via Myanmar and other Southeast Asian countries. The party says the government was planning to give India transit facilitiesa politically sensitive issue in Bangladeshto help the neighbour to reach its economically backward northeastern states. ""India surrounds us from three sides. So, we have to get connected with the Asian highway through India,"" Sheikh Mujibor Rahman, the standing committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after the meeting at parliament building on Tuesday. ""The highway through India will benefit us very much as we have had huge trade with India,"" said the chairman. He said his committee had suggested accepting any of the two routes of the Asian highway namely Benapole-Dhaka-Sylhet and Banglabandha-Dhaka-Sylhet. ""The ruling party MPs have suggested the government on the routes of the highway. But we have not made recommendations on it,"" Manju, the BNP MP, told bdnews24.com after the meeting. ""I have just read it as my party has been observing the development on the issue,"" he said. He said the government must first decide the routes of the highway. ""Then we will make final recommendation on it."" According to the first route, the highway will enter from the West Bengal of India through Benapole in Bangladesh and then re-enter India's northeastern Assam state via Tamabil border in Sylhet. A second proposal says the highway will enter Bangladesh from India through Banglabandha (Panchagarh) and finally meet Indian roads through Tamabil. The BNP says the highway finally must pass through Myanmar via Teknaf border. Golam Moula Roni, a standing committee member, told journalists that the highway should not pass through Teknaf as Bangladesh had small volume of trade with Myanmar. ""In addition, we will not be benefited at all if we go for Taknaf route to get connected with China through Kunming (Yunan province). ""We don't have any business dealings with Kunming and that part of China,"" said Roni. The main opposition BNP after coming to power in 2001 initiated a new foreign policy approach styled ""Look East Policy"" aimed at making closer relations with China. The BNP government did not finalise the routes of the Asian Highway in its five-year term from 2001. It tried to construct a cross-boundary highway through MyanmarBangladesh's only second neighbourto connect China by road through Kunming. The immediate-past military-installed caretaker government signed a deal on the cross-boundary road in 2007. The Asian Highway project was initiated in 1959 to promote the development of international road transport in the region, but progress slowed down when financial assistance was suspended in 1975, according to UNESCAP. A total of US$26 billion has already been invested in the improvement and upgrading of the ambitious network but $18 billion is still needed."

The big Russian, set to retire at the end of the season, fell at the first hurdle for the sixth time in eight events, losing to a player coming off a two-month injury layoff. ""I'm realistic. I know I am not going to win (another title). There is no way,"" the 29-year-old Safin told reporters. ""It's getting tougher and tougher with each tournament. It really gets into you and it's not easy to play. ""Every match is a battle. It's tough not to choke in the important moments. But I want to finish up in a right note. I should enjoy it more. I just want to finish up nice."" There were few signs of enjoyment on the scowling Russian's face as his 13th-seeded opponent raced to a 4-0 lead in the first set. Back after pulling out in the third round at Queens Club with a wrist injury, Monfils wrapped up the opener in 30 minutes. Safin came to life in the second, flashing occasional glimpses of the talent and bludgeoning power that earned him the world number one ranking in 2000 as he fought back to level the match. The former US and Australian Open champion sent a buzz through centre court when he broke the 22-year-old Frenchman to open the third set then held serve to go up 2-0. But Monfils swept through the next six games to seal the victory, leaving Safin to walk off to a smattering of applause. ""It slipped away in the third set. I was just a little too nervous,"" said Safin, who has won 15 career singles titles. ""It slipped away. I don't have a grip on the important moments. I wanted it too much.

Abdul Matin, a joint secretary, Sharif Masud, now an assistant secretary, and commodore R U Ahmed, who was made chairman of the Chittagong Port Authority on contract, are among those facing action. The standing committee unanimously accepted the report of the parliamentary sub-committee that found ""massive irregularities"" by the former adviser and the eight others on the last day of Matin's office on Jan 6 this year.

Chowdhury, on July 30, told a press briefing, that the panel found that Matin had direct role in awarding a container deal to a company in violation of the government guidelines. Chowdhury said the tender was not invited properly in line with the government rules and the CPA did not hold any board meeting before awarding the contract. He said a false certificate was given in favour of Ishaq Brothers, a ""novice"" company, and the tendering process caused financial losses to the public exchequer. Chowdhury also said that acting shipping secretary Masud Elahi and senior assistant shipping secretary Sharif Mohammad Masud involved in the deal had confessed to the panel that Matin forced them to award the contract to Ishaq Brothers in violation of government rules. And the officials of the CPA submitted papers, which proved Matin's direct involvement in awarding the work, he added. Mohammed Shah Alam, who heads the sub-committee, had told bdnews24.com on July 26 that they had enough papers that pointed to Matin's involvement in the corruption and would not summon him to defend himself against the charges. Awami League's Shamsul Haq Chowdhury and the BNP's Mostofa Kamal Pasha are the other members of the probe body. bd"
en.15.139.482.2009.8.13,Nadal's knees pass brief test at Montreal,"MONTREAL, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rafael Nadal survived a battle of creaky knees against David Ferrer on Wednesday, the fellow Spaniard retiring hurt from their second round match at the Montreal Masters to gift the world number two a comeback win. Sidelined for more than two months with tendonitis in both knees, Nadal's tender joints were in the spotlight for his first singles match since his shock loss to Sweden's Robin Soderling in the fourth round of the French Open in May. But it was Ferrer's left knee that became the talking point after he abruptly retired when trailing 4-3 in the opening set. Having betrayed little sign of discomfort, and having dominated play at times against his Davis Cup team mate, Ferrer's withdrawal prompted gasps and groans from the centre court crowd. The 27-year-old world number 19 said he had aggravated a knee injury that had troubled him before Wimbledon. ""I had problems with my knee, I cannot play,"" Ferrer told reporters. ""I've had the problem since before Wimbledon and I want to take some treatment,"" he said. Ferrer's retirement whisked Nadal into a third-round meeting with Philipp Petzschner of Germany, but the brief 37-minute workout answered few questions about the former world number one's own fitness. ""I need more days to have a real test but it was ok,"" Nadal said. ""I tried everything 100 percent but when you come back from injury, it's difficult to move well the first match. ""Everything is positive, every match, every point. Everything is helping me be ready as soon as possible to return to my level. ""I have another chance tomorrow to continue to improve."" Ferrer's retirement capped an abbreviated evening session at the Stade Uniprix complex which saw Germany's Tommy Haas also quit against Chilean 11th seed Fernando Gonzalez due to blisters. Tennis fans got better value for money during the day session, when resurgent Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero defeated 13th seed Gael Monfils of France 6-3, 7-6 to move into the third round. Having slipped outside the top 100 three months ago, former world number one Ferrero has struck form to claw his way back to number 29, and his defeat of Monfils sets up an intriguing meeting with third seed Andy Murray of Britain. Ferrer said he had learned from his quarter-final loss to the Briton at Wimbledon. ""I'm here in the third round against Murray, it means I am playing well,"" Ferrero told reporters. ""I know it is going to be very tough but I'm playing the way that I want to play. American fifth seed Andy Roddick, another player enjoying a career revival this season, also advanced with a tidy 6-1, 7-6 win over Russian Igor Andreev. Sixth-seeded Juan Martin Del Porto of Argentina defeated Czech Jan Hernych 6-2, 7-5 while seventh seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France survived a scare to beat over Germany's Rainer Schuettler 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. Spanish 10th seed Fernando Verdasco raced into the third round with a 6-1, 6-1 demolition of Argentina's Leonardo M"
en.15.139.32.2009.8.11,Stronger shrimp sector holds 'big boost for Bangladesh economy',"Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)A stronger shrimp sector with international standard quality and safety procedures could provide a big boost for Bangladesh economy, FAO country representative Ad Spijkers said following recent visits to the southern coastal areas of Khulna, Barisal and Cox's Bazar. Presently about 50,000 Black Tigers Shrimps are produced annually most of which are exported to the EU, USA and Japan. Bangladesh has adopted a millennium action plan to increase earning (expected to earn US$1.5 billion by 2010) from this sector by tripling its present production to introduce a shrimp seed certification system in the form of public-private partnership in the country though joint efforts between the department of fisheries under the ministry of fisheries and livestock and FAO, Spijkers said in a statement on Monday. Brackish water aquaculture especially shrimp aquaculture is the third largest foreign currency earning sector of Bangladesh, after manpower and garments, on which more than a million coastal rural people depend for their livelihood. Black Tiger Shrimp is the main culture species of coastal shrimp farming contribute about 60 percent of the cultivable species. FAO is providing support through a Technical Cooperation Project (TCP)""Developing a National Shrimp Certification System"". The main objective of the assistance is to develop and promote a government and private sector based participatory programme of shrimp brood stock (mother shrimp) management and seed certification facility for the department of fisheries in collaboration with the private sector in Cox's Bazar. An FAO field mission, led by country head Spijkers, visited the on-going activities of the project and the leading hatcheries that are playing very important rile for shrimp seed production. The visit from Aug 8-10, explored the potentials and risks of the sector and its future prospects. Spijkers emphasized on ensuring the quality of the shrimps for the international market and also on Standard Operating Procedures (SoP) that could increase the potentials and yield of approximately 218,000 hectres of coastal tidal lands of Bangladesh that are presently used for shrimp cultivation. His visit was also timed to coincide with the programmes of the just concluded National Fisheries W"

He described the move by the army-ruled Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, as politically motivated to prevent her from taking part in planned elections next year. ""It is further proof that the military regime in Burma is determined to act with total disregard for accepted standards of the rule of law in defiance of international opinion,"" Brown said in a statement.

Heavy rains from Typhoon Morakot triggered the mudslide, wiping out houses in the village in Kaohsiung county. Officials have said about 600 people could not be accounted for and they were feared buried. The government said the confirmed death toll across Taiwan from Typhoon Morakot, which battered the island over the weekend, was 38. Officials had rescued nearly 100 people from the village in Kaohsiung county out of about 1,000 residents, a military officer surnamed Hu, who was involved in the rescue, told Reuters. Another official from the disaster agency said some villagers had been contacted, although he did not have specific figures. ""Some people have been contacted and some are still missing and we're still on the scene checking,"" the official said. Heavy rain had washed out roads and bridges in the area, severing almost all land vehicle traffic. Helicopters were the only way to reach the village. The storm caused floods in Taiwan's densely-populated south and farm-related losses on the island were estimated at T$4.2 billion ($128 million).

Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said on Sunday the Buccaneer was freed after ""exceptional work"" on the part of Somali authorities and the Italian intelligence service. The owners of the Buccaneer, Ravenna-based Micoperi Marine Contractors, said on Sunday the ship was not freed as a result of military action or ransom payment. ""We have taken $4 million ransom and freed the Italian tugboat. It has already gone,"" pirate Aden told Reuters. Andrew Mwangura, coordinator of regional maritime group, East African Seafarers' Assistance Programme, said the pirates received $5 million. ""They were counting the money last evening,"" he told Reuters by telephone. The Buccaneer was hijacked on April 11 in the Gulf of Aden along with two barges. It is now on its way to the port of Djibouti escorted by naval vessels. It was crewed by 10 Italians, five Romanians and a Croatian. A flotilla of foreign naval vessels off Somalia has failed to quell the rampant piracy, which has affected one of the world's busiest shipping lanes that links Europe to Asia."

en.15.139.239.2009.8.12,China formally arrests Rio Tinto employees,"BEIJING, Aug 12,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia said on Wednesday that charges against four staff from Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto appeared to have been downgraded after China formally arrested the men but left aside accusations they stole state secrets. By arresting Australian Stern Hu and three Chinese staff of Rio only on suspicion of illegally obtaining commercial secrets and of bribery, China may have opened the way to easing some tension with Australia during fraught negotiations with Rio and other multinationals over iron ore prices. The accusations of suspected business crimes ""indicate that the case has moved from the 'state secrets' area,"" Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said in an emailed statement. He added that ""the range of possible penalties under these articles is less severe than for state secrets."" In reporting the formal arrests, China's official Xinhua news agency did not raise accusations of stealing state secrets, a sweeping charge raised in earlier reports. The commercial secrets charge can bring jail terms of up to 3 years, or 7 years in ""especially serious"" cases. ""Now that he has been formally arrested we encourage China to provide Mr Hu all the protections available under Chinese law including access to legal representation,"" said Smith. Rio Tinto's chief executive for iron ore, Sam Walsh, said the company also rejected the accusations of business misdeeds. ""Rio Tinto will strongly support its employees in defending these allegations,"" Walsh said in a written statement. ""From all the information available to us, we continue to believe that our employees have acted properly and ethically in their business dealings in China."" Walsh also urged China to let the accused men see lawyers. Experts said China's sidelining, for now at least, of the graver espionage claims may signal an effort to reduce political friction with Australia over the matter. ""That lowers the temperature,"" said Jerome Cohen, an expert on Chinese law at New York University. ""That puts this as a white collar crime, a commercial crime, and not espionage involving state secrets."" BIG STAKES, BAD PR Hu and the three other members of Rio Tinto's Shanghai-based iron ore marketing team -- Liu Caikui, Ge Minqiang and Wang Yong -- were detained on July 5. Hu, a Chinese-born Australian citizen and head of the team, was accused of obtaining the Chinese steel industry's negotiating stance in iron ore price talks, sources have said. Iron ore is used to make steel. The Rio case has cast a shadow over Australia-China trade, worth $53 billion in two-way terms in 2008. China is also deadlocked in negotiations with foreign iron ore suppliers, including Rio, and is seeking a better price than agreed by other Asian steel mills. Australia exported $15 billion worth of iron ore to China in 2008, accounting for 41 percent of China's iron ore imports in that period. ""I think they wanted to get the bad PR behind them as much as they could, but at the same time get a message out to corporations operating in China,"" said Scott Harrison of Pacific Strategies and Assessments, an Asia-focused risk consultancy, referring to the arrests without state secrets accusations. Many observers see little chance the four men will avoid a trial. Fu Ziying, China's vice minister of commerce, hinted as much when he told a news conference in Beijing they would receive a ""fair verdict."" ""I believe this case will not, and should not, affect the healthy and stable development of Chinese-Australian bilateral trade and economic relations,"" Fu said. Under Chinese law the arrests do not amount to a formal decision to go to trial. They allow authorities to continue investigating, with a formal decision coming later on whether to try, said Mo Shaoping, a prominent criminal lawyer in Beijing. Shares in Rio Tinto, the world's second-biggest producer of iron ore, closed up 0.17 percent at A$58.00 on Wednesday, but have fallen 4.2 percent since Friday after a report from China that said the company had been spying for six years. Rival BHP Billiton has been steady over the same period while the benchmark Australian S&P/ASX 200 index has risen about 1 percent. Walsh, the Rio executive, said the case had not upset the company's iron ore supplies to China. ""Rio Tinto is working to resolve this matter and continues its business operations in China, including the maintenance of high levels of iron ore shipments from Australia,"" he said. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, a former diplomat who speaks Chinese, has warned Beijing it had significant interests at stake in detaining Hu, and said the world was watching how it handled a case that has highlighted risks of doing deals in the world's third-largest economy. On Tuesday, the United States echoed that warning. ""China and how it reacts to cases like this will have a bearing on the international business climate and the willingness of individual businesses to invest in China,"" a US State Department spokesman, Philip Crowley, said in Washing"
en.15.139.131.2009.8.14,International connectivity restored after 16 hours,"Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)International connectivity to Bangladesh returned Friday evening after a 16-hour disruption as the country's submarine cable link was restored in Cox's Bazar, a top official said. ""We heard that the link was restored around 6.30pm,"" said managing director of Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Ltd Monwar Hossain. Internet services countrywide were severely disrupted by an overnight break in the link connecting Bangladesh to submarine cable SEA-ME-WE-4. The South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 4 is the submarine cable system linking South East Asia to Europe via the Indian Sub-Continent and Middle East. The cable boosts bandwidth and global connectivity of users along its route between Singapore and France. Hossain told bdnews24.com that Bangladesh's link to the SEA-ME-WE-4 was cut at around 2.45am between Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. He said roadworks on the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar highway had caused the accidental cut in the optical fibre link some 22km from Chittagong at Putiya. Net speeds fell after Typhoon Morakot Bangladesh had already been experiencing slow internet speeds over the past few days, after Typhoon Morakot damaged submarine cables in East Asia earlier in the week, a telecoms official said on Thursday. BTCL managing director Khabiruzzaman told bdnews24.com that the region was facing trouble because of the damage to the Asia Pacific Cable Network-2 (APCN-2). Reuters also reported that up to 90 percent of all voice call and Internet services from parts of East Asia were disrupted after the typhoon damaged undersea cables in the region. Khabiruzzaman had said APCN-2 was being repaired in East Asia and net speeds would be restored by Friday. But Bangladesh subsequently experienced the further disruption with the break in its own optical fibre link connecting to the SEA-ME-WE-4."
en.15.139.317.2009.8.13,Chelsea skipper Terry predicts 'fight to the death',"LONDON, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea captain John Terry is predicting a ""fight to the death"" as his team attempt to end Manchester United's three-year domination of the Premier League. The big-spending Londoners won the title in 2005 and 2006 under former coach Jose Mourinho but since then have been runners-up twice and third last season. Avram Grant, Luiz Felipe Scolari and Guus Hiddink have all failed to emulate Mourinho's double triumph and this time the task of toppling United from top spot falls to former AC Milan supremo Carlo Ancelotti. ""It will be close, as it has been for the last four or five years,"" defender Terry told the club's website (www.chelseafc.com) as his team prepared for Saturday's home league game with Hull City. ""We have been pushing them (United) closely and when we won it, they were pushing us, so it will be a fight to the death. ""I am sure at the same time Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City will be pushing and upsetting a few good teams as well,"" added England skipper Terry who last month turned down a money-spinning move to City. Chelsea ended their pre-season campaign in encouraging style, beating United 4-1 on penalties when the traditional Community Shield curtain-raiser at Wembley ended 2-2 after 90 minutes. One of the chief talking points of that game was Chelsea's new 4-4-2 playing style preferred by Ancelotti. Mourinho's title-winning teams adopted a 4-3-3 strategy and that system was retained by successors Grant, Scolari and Hiddink. Since Nicolas Anelka joined Chelsea in January 2008 it has been rare to find him and fellow striker Didier Drogba paired together in the same starting lineup. MIDFIELD DIAMOND Ancelotti, though, seems keen to employ both goal-getters ahead of a four-man midfield diamond formation. ""He (Ancelotti) wants us to be organised, win the ball back as quickly as we can and play good, attacking football,"" said vice-captain Frank Lampard. ""The manager has settled very quickly and we have picked up his ideas very quickly so the improvements will come. ""He is very easy to work for in terms of his man management,"" added the England midfielder. ""He is a very nice man and a very strong man on the training ground so everyone has reacted to that and now we're looking forward to going into the season."" Chief among the reasons for Ancelotti's recruitment by billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich were his two Champions League triumphs with Milan. Winning Europe's elite club competition for the first time may be Abramovich's top target this season but Lampard left no one in any doubt about his own priority. ""For me it is the Premier League,"" said the former West Ham United player. ""I grew up watching the Premiership and the league before that and it's a lovely feeling to be the best team in your country and I want to get that back. ""The Champions League is definitely something I want to win at least once in my career but for me the Premier League is where we need to get to the consistency levels we had a few years"

Immigration officers at Zia International Airport stopped Sayeedi from boarding a plane to Saudi Arabia on July 24. Sayeedi filed a petition on July 27 challenging the government's actions.

en.15.139.242.2009.8.13,Wenger hoping Rosicky and Eduardo can spur on Arsenal,"LONDON, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After agreeing more big-name departures, Arsene Wenger will hope the return to fitness of Tomas Rosicky and Eduardo da Silva can spur his young Arsenal side to silverware this season. The desire of the fans for manager Wenger to end years of high-profile exits by making expensive close-season signings grew when defender Kolo Toure and striker Emmanuel Adebayor moved to Manchester City. However, the Frenchman's only signing has been Ajax Amsterdam centre back Thomas Vermaelen and he will instead put his faith in Czech Republic midfielder Rosicky and Croatia striker Eduardo, who almost represent new players after injury-ravaged spells. Rosicky has been sidelined by a troublesome hamstring injury while Eduardo is back after a groin problem that followed a horrific broken leg in February 2008. A Champions League semi-final appearance last season was testament to the talent Wenger's teenage army possess but a fourth-placed Premier League finish indicates consistency remains an obstacle. Rosicky's return alongside captain Cesc Fabregas, Samir Nasri and Andrei Arshavin will increase creativity in the midfield and the side will be helped further by having a classy partnership in Eduardo and Robin van Persie up front. ""I don't see why we should be scared ... I see the offensive potential we have,"" Rosicky told the club's website (www.arsenal.com). ""Of course we know we have to do better, we are not blind to that, but we can see it's positive."" INCREDIBLE CAMPAIGN Arsenal's last league title came in 2004 after an incredible unbeaten campaign. However, none of that squad remain at the club. The Londoners have not won anything since the 2005 FA Cup although they have continued to compete well in the Champions League, reaching the 2006 final before losing to Barcelona. A highlight this season is likely to be the emergence of 17-year-old midfielder Jack Wilshere, who has outside hopes of an England World Cup call-up. ""Jack reminds me a bit of (Wayne) Rooney when he started, in his belief and his positive attitude to go forwards,"" said Wenger. The diminutive left-footer is rapidly becoming a fan favourite and will join the ranks of talented youngsters such as Aaron Ramsey, Kieran Gibbs and Carlos Vela in the first team. ""He has benefited a lot from special treatment,"" added Wenger. ""The only problem in England, knowing the impatience of the people, is it will be difficult to keep the right pace in his progress."" Asked what would be an acceptable level of success this season, Wenger said: ""To win the league championship and to win the Champions League, anything else is a disaster according to our f"
en.15.139.483.2009.8.10,"""Three amigos"" summit dominated by swine flu, trade","GUADALAJARA, Mexico, Aug 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leaders of the United States, Mexico and Canada gather on Monday to present a united front to try to limit the spread of the H1N1 swine flu, but there is less unity on simmering trade issues. US President Barack Obama, Mexican President Felipe Calderon and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper enjoyed folk dancing and a mariachi band late Sunday and now are getting down to business at a North American summit. They hold talks with all three feeling the heat from an economic downturn. The leaders, sometimes referred to as ""the three amigos,"" are expected to issue a joint communique stressing their shared commitment to keep a predicted resurgence in the H1N1 virus this autumn as limited as possible. A senior Obama administration official said the goal was to ensure that the people of the three countries are fully informed about steps to mitigate the spread of the virus, which is believed to have originated in Mexico last spring. Obama held 45 minutes of talks with Calderon before they were joined by Harper for a dinner at the sprawling Cabanas Cultural Center. Crowds lined Obama's motorcade route. Calderon wasted little time in raising what Mexico considers a pressing trade issue -- a cross-border trucking dispute. Mexican trucks are supposed to be allowed to cross into the United States under the North American Free Trade Agreement, but US trucking companies say Mexican trucks are not safe. Mexico imposed retaliatory tariffs of $2.4 billion in US goods in March after Obama signed a bill canceling a program allowing Mexican trucks to operate beyond the US border. Obama made clear to Calderon that he was working with the US Congress to resolve what he considers to be legitimate safety concerns. ""I think there's been a clear understanding that this issue was one that is a priority issue and one that everyone would like to see resolved as quickly as possible,"" the senior Obama official said. Canadian officials are expected to raise concerns about ""Buy American"" elements of a $787 billion US economic stimulus program that they fear could shut out Canadian companies. Canada is the United States' largest trading partner. Mexico's ambassador to Canada, Francisco Barrio, said that in talks with Harper Calderon expressed concern about a measure to require Mexicans to have visas to visit Canada. Obama and Calderon also talked about Mexico's warring drug gangs. Washington is worried about the rising body count as Mexican gangs kill rivals in record numbers, despite Calderon's three-year army assault on the drug cartels. Mexico says US equipment and training under a $1.4 billion ""Merida Initiative"" package are taking too long to arrive, partly due to concerns in the US Congress over Mexico's human rights record. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont has blocked what was described as a favorable US State Department report on Mexico's human rights record, delaying the release of $100 million in US aid intended to help Mexico fight narcotics traffickers Mexico's ambassador to the United States, Arturo Sarukhan, told reporters ""there is one senator that is worried about the issue,"" and that ""this is not part of a wide movement inside the Sena"
en.15.139.304.2009.8.14,Sprint showdown the highlight of world champs,"BERLIN, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - When it comes to showdowns, athletics has seen nothing like it since days of Ben Johnson v Carl Lewis more than 20 years ago. Usain Bolt, the triple Olympic champion, against Tyson Gay, the triple world champion. The fastest man ever over 100 and 200 metres against the fastest man of 2009 over both distances. The extravagant crowd-pleaser against the ""boring"" one. However, Sunday's 100 metres final (8:35 pm British time) and the 200 on Thursday represent only a flashing 30 seconds of what should be an entertaining nine days. It all takes place on the iconic blue track of Berlin's Olympic Stadium and officials have not been afraid to ride the exploits of Jesse Owens there at the 1936 Olympics. The United States team will wear kit with the initials JO stitched in while the descendents of Owens and German long jumper Luz Long will present the medals for the men's long jump. In the 1936 Games, Luz famously gave Owens advice on his run-up after the American had fouled his first two jumps. He made his third safely and went on to win the event, along with three golds on the track. Luz took silver and the two men walked from the stadium, arm-in-arm and became lifelong friends despite the political pressures within Germany at the time. The relationship between Bolt and Gay is unlikely to be so enduring. Though there is none of the bristling animosity that marked the Lewis-Johnson rivalry, today's best sprinters rarely get beyond a ""hi, how's it going?"" when they pass. 'EXCITING INDIVIDUAL' ""Usain Bolt is a very exciting individual. He's fun and he has a lot of personality and is exciting. And he backs it up,"" Gay said this week. ""I'm probably what you call boring."" Times of 9.77 for the 100 metres and 19.58 over 200 would not generally be called boring. If Gay's persistent groin problem holds out and he gets good starts the American has the chance of unsettling Bolt in what, with Asafa Powell also hoping to have a say, could be two of the sport's all-time great races. The women's sprints look more open, particularly the 100 where seven competitors have broken 11 seconds this season. Olympic silver medallist Kerron Stewart is the form runner and her 10.75 in Rome was the fastest for nine years. Compatriots Shelly-Ann Fraser, the Olympic champion, and Veronica Campbell-Brown, the world champion, will also be in the mix while the American challenge is spearheaded by Carmelita Jeter, seemingly peaking at the age of 29. Campbell-Brown could have a stronger chance in the 200 metres, where she is the Olympic champion, but the favourite to make it three world titles in a row is American Allyson Felix. As with Bolt and Gay, American 400 metres rivals Jeremy Wariner and LaShawn Merritt have avoided each other all season but they know each other well enough. Merritt finally stepped out of the shadows to beat Wariner in the Olympics last year and is confident he can prevent his compatriot completing a hat-trick of world titles. Yelena Isinbayeva is also seeking a third successive world gold in the pole vault and, until a month ago, looked an unbackable favourite. An early exit at last month's London Grand Prix showed she is human but, with Olympic silver medallist Jennifer Stuczynski pulling out this week with an Achilles injury, even a below-par Isinbayeva looks good enough to win. Kenenisa Bekele already has three world golds to his name over 10,000 metres and is seeking to match compatriot Haile Gebrselassie by making it four in a row. The world record holder's chances were boosted Friday by the injury-withdrawal of compatriot Sileshi Sihine, the man who habitually follows him over the line at major championships. Sihine's wife Tirunesh Dibaba has also pulled out of her defence of the 10,000 metres but could still run over 5"

en.15.139.291.2009.8.13,Tigers aim to wrap up series,"Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will be aiming to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match GrameenPhone Cup when they take on Zimbabwe at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Friday. The match will start at 2:30pm (Bangladesh time) and TEN Sports and Bangladesh Television will telecast the game live. The Tigers are full of confidence after securing victories in the first two games by eight wickets and 49 runs respectively. Another win for Shakib Al Hasan's men will ensure only their fourth overseas ODI series triumph. Earlier, Bangladesh trounced Kenya 3-0 in 2006, outplayed Zimbabwe 3-1 in 2006-07 and last month inflicted a three-nil whitewash on West Indies. A win at Bulawayo will be their eighth in a row, which will be one short of their record best in ODIs. The tourists will be looking towards Shakib Al Hasan again for inspiration. The world's number one all-rounder has certainly justified his credentials since assuming the captaincy from skipper Mashrafe Bin Mortaza who had to fly home from West Indies after injuring himself during the first Test. Shakib, the man-of the-match and series in West Indies, has proved himself a worthy leader and performer in Zimbabwe with ball and bat. He is now on a five-match unbeaten streak as captain. The talented left-hander scored his third ODI ton, (104 off 64 balls) the fastest by any Bangladeshi and the eighth quickest in limited-overs history, helping Bangladesh to win the second ODI against Zimbabwe. Their other key batsmen Mohammad Ashraful, who under-performed in the Caribbean, announced his return to form with a glorious century in the first match while openers Tamim Iqbal, with consecutive fifties, and Junaed Siddique have provided a perfect platform for the side on each occasion. In the absence of three leading bowlers, Mashrafe bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak and Rubel Hossain, Bangladesh's spinners have stepped up admirably in Zimbabwe. Spin accounted for five wickets in each of the first two games, with the host batsmen struggling especially against the slow stuff in the series opener. Two days before the third one-dayer, the Bangladesh cricketers took the opportunity to recuperate, according to TigerCricket.com. ""There was swimming, recovery and massage. The boys stayed at the hotel and rested. They have been playing non-stop so this was a welcome break. Some of the boys have slight niggles and they had treatment,"" team operations manager Shafique-ul Haque Heera was quoted as saying. The Tigers returned to training Thursday afternoon to prepare for the game on Friday. Shakib was determined to maintain the momentum. ""I believe we have been successful so far because we could keep our concentration going for the entire match. Also, we never allowed pressure to get to us. The boys are playing according to the game-plan and I attribute the results to team effort. The series is still open and that's why we just need to keep our focus and do our job in the middle,"" said Shakib. Regarding his own eye-catching form the 22-year-old felt attitude was the key. ""I have seen that you have more chances of succeeding if you go into a game in a positive frame of mind. I have tried to be positive and it has worked for me so far,"" said Shakib. It is unlikely Bangladesh will make any changes.

en.15.139.65.2009.8.14,Iran candidate says prisoners tortured to death,"TEHRAN, Aug 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karoubi said on his website Thursday that some of those arrested after the June presidential election were tortured to death, but other inmates defended their treatment. Authorities were not immediately available for comment, but state television, in a report on a parliamentary committee investigating claims of prison abuse, has shown people testifying that they were treated properly. ""I am not under pressure. I am satisfied with the conditions provided by the jail authorities,"" said a young detainee in Tehran's Evin prison, where many political prisoners are held. Expanding on allegations he made Sunday that some arrested protesters, men and women, had been raped at Tehran's Kahrizak prison, Karoubi said detainees had reported being forced to go naked, with prison guards riding on their backs. Still others were piled on top of each other, also naked. ""We observe that in an Islamic country some young people are beaten to death just for chanting slogans in (the post- election) protests,"" Karoubi's Etemademelli website said. ""Some of the detainees said they were forced to take off their clothes. Then they were made to go on their hands and knees and were ridden (by prison guards),"" Karoubi said. ""Or the prison authorities put them on top of each other while they were naked,"" he added. His allegation about prisoners in Kahrizak prison being raped was rejected by Iranian authorities as ""baseless."" Many of the post-election detainees were held in the south Tehran prison, built to house people breaching vice laws. At least three people died in custody there and widespread anger erupted as reports of abuse in the jail spread. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the closure of the Kahrizak prison last month. The abuse allegations, also rejected by Tehran's police chief, have created a rift among hardline politicians, many of whom backed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election. The disputed election was followed by the worst unrest in Iran since its 1979 Islamic revolution. ""PRESIDENT'S WORD LIKE GOD'S"" A senior Iranian cleric seen as Ahmadinejad's spiritual mentor said obeying the head of government was like obeying God, the moderate Etemad-e Melli newspaper said. Firebrand cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi believes the authority of Khamenei comes from God, not from the people. Khamenei presides over a complex political and clerical system known as vali-ye faqih, or religious jurisprudence, with the president in charge of the day-to-day governing of the country. ""When a president is endorsed by the vali-ye faqih, obeying the president is like obeying God,"" the daily quoted Mesbah-Yazdi as saying. Mesbah-Yazdi's followers have great sway among Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard and the Basij volunteer paramilitary force. The Guard's political chief Yadollah Javani has called for defeated candidates Karoubi and Mirhossein Mousavi as well as moderate former President Mohammad Khatami to be put on trial for inciting election unrest. At least 200 people still remain in jail, including senior moderate politicians, activists, lawyers and journalists. Khamenei swiftly endorsed Ahmadinejad's re-election after the June 12 presidential vote. The losing candidates say the poll was rigged, a charge denied by Iran's authorities, including Khamenei, who has accused Western powers of fomenting the vote unrest. Moderates say 69 protesters were killed in the demonstrations, contradicting the official report of 26 deaths. FRENCHWOMAN'S RELEASE EXPECTED Iran's police and security forces quelled the protests and the judiciary has now begun mass trials of more than 100 moderates, despite the damage it might inflict on the government's legitimacy and relations with the West. The United States, its European allies and Iranian moderates have denounced the mass trials as a ""sham."" Among those being tried are French teaching assistant Clotilde Reiss and two employees of French and British embassies in Tehran, accused of espionage and taking part in a Western plot, charges France and Britain say are baseless. Reiss's father said Thursday he hoped his daughter would leave prison later in the day, after France agreed to provide bail for her conditional release. The fallout from the post-election unrest further clouds prospects of Iran accepting US President Barack Obama's offer of direct talks on Iran's nuclear program. Tehran denies that it has nuclear arms ambiti"
en.15.139.71.2009.8.13,Bayern hope Ribery return marks change of fortune,"BERLIN, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Playmaker Franck Ribery will make his season debut on Saturday against Werder Bremen hoping to steer Bayern Munich to their first Bundesliga victory and put the Real Madrid transfer saga firmly behind him. Ribery had publicly expressed his desire to join the Spanish club during the close season but Bayern, who have him under contract until 2011, refused to budge. A protracted tug-of-war ensued between the three parties before Ribery picked up a knee injury that ruled him out for about a month and forced him to miss last weekend's Bundesliga opener, a lacklustre 1-1 draw against Hoffenheim. ""I am certain that Franck will play on Saturday. The match with France will also have given him extra motivation,"" Bayern manager Uli Hoeness said on the club's website (www.fcbayern.de). Ribery, who returned to full team training last week, played 25 minutes in France's 1-0 win over the Faroe Islands after Bayern grudgingly allowed him to travel with the national team. Striker Miroslav Klose will also return to action after missing the opener due to injury. Klose was on target in Germany's World Cup qualifier, a 2-0 win against hosts Azerbaijan on Wednesday. Ukrainian midfielder Anatoliy Tymoshchuk is also expected to start, replacing injured captain Mark van Bommel. Ribery's high-profile return is not the only highlight of the weekend as striker Lukas Podolski is also expected to make his Bundesliga debut for Cologne after returning following three hapless seasons with Bayern. Celebrated in the German city as 'Prince Poldi', the 24-year-old will have his work cut out when Cologne take on champions and league leaders VfL Wolfsburg who seem to have carried their sparkling form that landed them to their first title over to this se"

A Myanmar court sentenced the 64-year-old Nobel peace laureate to three years in detention on Tuesday for violating an internal security law, a sentence then halved by the military government. The sentence drew condemnation abroad, although criticism from most of Myanmar's fellow members of the 10-country Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) was muted. ""I already sent a letter to ASEAN members, but we need a consensus,"" Thai Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya told reporters by telephone after talks in Malaysia with his ministerial counterpart. Along with Thailand and Myanmar, ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam. Thailand currently chairs ASEAN. The UN Security Council voiced ""serious concern"" about the sentence in a statement watered down to meet misgivings from Russia and from China, which has reasonably friendly ties with Myanmar's military leaders. The charges against Suu Kyi stemmed from US intruder John Yettaw's two-day uninvited stay at her home in May, which the court ruled was in breach of the terms of her house arr"
en.15.139.486.2009.8.14,Trescothick wakes up in cold sweat over possible return,"LONDON, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former England batsman Marcus Trescothick woke up in a cold sweat this week at the thought of a possible recall for the final Ashes Test against Australia at the Oval, he said Thursday. ""There is a nightmare a lot of cricketers experience that they can't get their pads on when they are due in to bat,"" the 33-year-old Somerset player wrote in his column in the Bristol Evening Post. ""My dream was a variation of that. I couldn't get my England kit out of my bag. The other players were waiting for me on the pitch to do a team photo so I was in a right panic. I woke up in a cold sweat."" Trescothick has been touted for a possible recall at the Oval next week, with the series poised at 1-1, but he dismissed the idea. ""There will be no England comeback for me in the final Ashes Test,"" he said. Trescothick helped his country win the 2005 Ashes by racking up 431 runs and he is the top scorer in county cricket this year, with an average of 78.23. After playing 76 Tests and hitting 5,825 runs at an average of 43.79, the left-hander called time on his international career in March 2008 due to health problems. Trescothick had long suffered from a stress-related illness and had to pull out of England's 2006 tours to India and Australia. Another batsman being linked with an England call is Jonathan Trott, who scored 121 for Warwickshire against Nottinghamshire Thursday. Team-mate Ian Bell, recalled when Kevin Pietersen was ruled out of the series after sustaining an injury in the second Test, was 92 not out for Warwicks. Kent's Robert Key, another Oval contender, was out for 15 in the second innings against Northamptonshire while Surrey's in-form Mark Ramprakash hit 24 in a 40-over match against Glamorgan at the Oval Wednesday n"
en.15.139.129.2009.8.10,Iran will strongly resist West vote interference: official,"TEHRAN, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran accused the West on Monday of ""meddling"" in its state affairs for criticizing its mass trial of moderates charged with spying and trying to topple the clerical establishment after the disputed president vote. ""Do we interfere in other countries' state matters? Why should they interfere in ours? Iran will strongly resist such meddling,"" senior official Hassan Qashqavi told a weekly news conference. ""Why don't they (the West) leave us and our people alone?"" The June 12 election, which secured hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election, plunged Iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 Islamic revolution, exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite and set off a wave of protests that left 26 people dead. In an attempt to uproot the opposition, Iran began two mass trials of over 100 people, including prominent figures, a French woman and two Iranians working for the British and French embassies in Tehran. It charged them with spying and assisting a Western plot to overthrow the clerical rule. The United States and its European allies have rejected the trials as a ""show."" Britain and France have denied that those detained were spies. The Swedish EU presidency said actions against one EU country or citizen were considered an act against the entire 27-nation bloc. Espionage and acting against national security are punishable by death under Iran's Islamic law. Moderates say the vote was rigged in favor of Ahmadinejad, backed by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Officials say it was the ""healthiest"" vote in the past 30 years. Leading moderates, including defeated candidates Mirhossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi, have denounced the mass trials as an ""invaluable show,"" saying confessions were made under duress. ""UNLAWFUL COMMENTS"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Qashqavi said comments made by Frenchwoman Clotilde Reiss and two Iranians working for French and British embassies in Tehran proved foreign intervention in Iran's internal affairs. ""Their comments in the court were unlawful, illogical and surprising,"" Qashqavi said. ""This French lady says she was a French language teacher in Isfahan ... then she takes part in protests, takes photographs and film. This has nothing to do with her French teaching."" Qashqavi said the British employee Hossein Rassam's confessions ""were not made under pressure."" Rassam is charged with espionage and was freed on $100,000 bail on July 19. Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards on Sunday urged judiciary to put on trial Mousavi, Karoubi and former president Mohammad Khatami for orchestrating protests after the June poll. Khamenei ordered a prison's closure in July for ""lack of necessary standards"" to preserve prisoners' rights, and the police chief Esmail Ahmadi-Moghaddam said some of those protesters held at Kahrizak detention center had been tortured. Many of the post-election detainees were held in the southern Tehran Kahrizak prison, built to house people breaching the vice laws. At least three people died in custody there and widespread anger erupted as news spread of abuse in the jail. On Sunday Karoubi said on his website that some protesters, both male and female, had been raped while in detention, and that he had written to the head of a powerful arbitration body calling for an investigation. Some 200 protesters remain in prison, including senior pro-reform politicians, journalists, activists and lawyers. Ahmadinejad was sworn into office on Wednesday. He has until August 19 name his new cabinet, which the opposition says will be illegitimate."

Second seed Serena Williams, who holds three of the four grand-slam titles, also advanced to the third round after overpowering Kateryna Bondarenko of Ukraine 6-3, 6-2. Belgian Clijsters, in her first competitive tournament after a two-year break, staged a second-set fightback to win in 70 minutes. ""The main thing I was happy with today was the first-serve percentage was a lot better than the first match,"" the 26 year-old told reporters. ""Although I started making a few little mistakes here and there, I stayed aggressive. If you start doubting yourself you start defending a little bit more. ""I'm glad I stayed focussed and just stuck to my game plan."" Unseeded Clijsters, who gave birth to her first child during her time away from the circuit, took the first set after racing to a 3-0 lead before world number 20 Schnyder could steady. The Swiss raised her game in the second but the Belgian broke in the 12th game to set up a clash with Russian sixth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova, the French Open champion. ""I think any match now is a good test,"" Clijsters said. ""(Marion) Bartoli (the player she beat in round one), Patty, they're good players. AGGRESSIVE TENNIS ""Svetlana is kind of in between.

en.15.139.287.2009.8.13,Kashmir violence raises new security worries for India,"NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR Aug 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A spurt in violence in Kashmir shows militants may have abandoned a strategy of backing peaceful street protests to fight Indian rule, raising fears of sucking in Indian and Pakistani troops to their tense border. Separatists groups hoped that months of street protests last year could galvanise into a massive anti-India movement, but the demonstrations petered out and New Delhi carried out two rounds of peaceful elections in the state, despite boycott calls. ""The militant groups do not want the administration to settle down and are using violent tactics now as people in the region are talking peace and even voted in large numbers,"" Naresh Chandra, a former envoy to Washington, said. ""Pakistan continues to aid militants crossing over from their side and this could raise tension between troops also,"" he said. A rise in tension could be a blow for the United States, which wants India and Pakistan to resume a peace process, paused after November's Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, so that Islamabad can focus its security efforts on its Afghan border. Since July, 30 people have been killed in firefights along a military Line of Control dividing Kashmir between India and Pakistan, and 14 infiltration attempts have been made, double than last year during the same period, Indian officials say. Two-decade-old separatist violence in Kashmir has fallen since India and Pakistan, which claim the disputed Himalayan region in full, began a peace process in 2004. Also, state polls held last year in Kashmir saw a turnout of more than 60 percent, despite a boycott call by separatists. People also came out to vote during the April/May general election held this year, prompting some separatist leaders to talk about a shift of strategy from backing peaceful protests to adopting violent tactics. ""They (Pakistan-based groups) find things have gone far too peaceful ... They don't wish for this prolonged peace and stability,"" Deepak Kapoor, India'a army chief, told reporters this week in New Delhi. ""Hence you see heightened activity, heightened attempts to try to get as many people in before the winters come, snow falls and passes close,"" Kapoor said. Last week, Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani reiterated Pakistan's stance that resolving issues such as Kashmir was important for regional stability, which Indian experts said was a ploy to keep the Kashmir issue alive. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947, two of them over Kashmir. ""Pakistan is trying to convince the western world that Kashmir is raging and these militants are all freedom fighters fighting to free Kashmir from Indian rule,"" Amulya Ganguli, a defence expert, said.

en.15.139.44.2009.8.13,CPA may have to handle CCT after operator's contract expires,"Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)The government is likely to form a joint-body comprising berth operators and officials of the Chittagong Port Authority to handle containers at the Chittagong Container Terminal in case of failure to appoint an operator, the shipping minister said on Thursday. ""The government is considering the option as current CCT operator SaifPowerTech's contract expires on Aug 15,"" Shajahan Khan, the minister, told bdnews24.com. The parliamentary standing committee on the shipping ministry has also recommended cancelling a deal with Esack Brothers, who secured a container deal contract by ""irregular"" means, said Khan. ""We cannot ask SaifPowerTech to continue the work for an uncertain period as the operator will charge Tk 165 more for each container than Esack Brothers did,"" he said. ""The port handles more than 2000 containers daily,"" he said. ""So, SaifPowerTech will cost the public more money than Esack Brothers did,"" Khan said. He said his ministry would honour the parliamentary standing committee's recommendation to the ministry to cancel the contract with Esack Brothers, allegedly a ""novice company"". According to the contract, Esack Brothers would charge Tk 340 per container. ""It would be unfair to allow Esack Brothers to handle the containers,"" the minister said. ""Given the circumstances, we are thinking of forming a joint committee comprising port officials and the berth operators to handle containers as an interim measure,"" Khan said. Khan said a port official would head the committee. ""Of course, I will seek legal advice on the move and if necessary I will also seek prime minister Sheikh Hasina's opinions to solve the problem,"" said Khan. The minister said he had already held preliminary talks with the berth operators, but they had not raised the issue of charges yet. Md Sarwar Hossain Sagor, senior vice-president of Bangladesh Masters Stevedors' Association (BMSA), the berth operators' organisation, told bdnews24.com that they were ready to handle containers if asked to. ""As the berth operators, we used to handle containers prior to the 1/11 changeover,"" said Sagor. ""We are completely ready to handle containers if asked to,"" he said. Sagor said in June this year the association sent a letter to the ministry expressing their readiness to handle the containers. ""The rate would be negotiable."" ""But I can assure you that it will be less than what SaifPowerTech is asking,"" said Sagor. On May 27, the parliamentary standing committee on the shipping ministry formed a four-member probe body to investigate alleged irregularities in awarding container handling operations at Chittagong Port. The probe body concluded that Esack Brothers had no experience in container handling and secured the work through an irregular deal by former shipping adviser MA Matin. The committee therefore asked the ministry to scrap the deal with Esack Brothers. b"

The MV Mu San dropped anchor off Hut Bay island in the Andaman islands last week without permission and was detained by the coastguard after a more than six-hour chase. Officials said they were trying to determine whether the vessel had been anywhere near Myanmar, suspected to be seeking help from North Korea to build a nuclear reactor. Crew members have provided no explanation why the ship had anchored near Hut Bay, a populated island. ""We have not found any nuclear material on board the ship,"" Ashok Chand, a senior police officer, told Reuters from Port Blair, capital of the Andaman and Nicobar islands. ""But we are continuing our investigation to check any discrepancies in statements by crew members."" Indian officials said they were taking no chances in view of North Korean sales of missiles and other weapons materials to tense regions of the world. A Korean interpreter was helping with interrogations of the 39-member crew. ""Once we are fully convinced, then only we will decide what will be the next step,"" Chand said. The ship could now be escorted to Andhra Pradesh, where its consignment of sugar could be checked further, a police officer unauthorised to speak to the media said. India has also tightened security in the Andamans and is looking for foreign ships which had strayed into Indian waters. UN member states are authorised to inspect North Korean sea, air and land cargo, and seize and destroy goods transported in violation of a Security Council resolution in June following the North's nuclear tests.

en.15.139.497.2009.8.12,Hundreds still missing from Taiwan mudslide,"CISHAN, Taiwan, Aug 12,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of people were still missing on Wednesday in remote villages in southern Taiwan and disaster officials said they were uncertain how many might have been killed by mudslides triggered by Typhoon Morakot. Morakot, which ravaged Taiwan over the weekend, has killed about 70 people across the island and caused farm-related losses of more than T$9 billion ($275 million). More than 100 people have been killed in Asia due to Morakot and tropical storm Etau. But several hundred villagers initially listed as missing were found alive in areas where roads were washed out and access was limited to helicopters. The government dispatched special forces with satellite phones to the hardest hit areas. ""We are anxious to do our best to get the trapped people out,"" said Hu Jui-chou, an army official involved in the rescue effort. ""Hopes are getting slimmer as the days go by."" Hu said it was unclear how many people were buried and feared dead in villages in southern Taiwan. More than 200 residents of Hsiao Lin village in Kaohsiung county were found safe. But officials said it was uncertain how many of the 1,000 registered residents were present when the mudslide struck. Hundreds more were found alive in other villages. Survivors said they clambered to higher ground before walls of mud and rock engulfed their homes. ""I have to say I feel pretty good to be alive,"" said Lin Dong-wen, 45, from the village of Namahsia, sitting in front of a pile of medicine after being hoisted away by a rescue helicopter. ""If I had been left there any longer, I wouldn't have made it. I saw the mudslide coming,"" said Lin after arriving in Cishan, hub of rescue efforts. ""It was really huge, and I passed out. When I awoke, there was mud all over and I climbed out of it."" Helicopters dropped food and supplies to survivors who had scrambled up hillsides. Other rescue teams piloted rubber dinghies through raging muddy rivers. Torrential rains from the typhoon had triggered landslides that wiped out villages and sent low-rise buildings crashing down river banks. Roads and bridges were destroyed. Clusters of anxious relatives awaited the arrival of helicopter flights at the makeshift rescue base. Some survivors tried to call relatives on mobile phones. ""Right after the mudslide, we managed to get in touch with our family members through mobile phones and text messages,"" said a 41-year-old teacher awaiting news at the rescue hub. ""But later they switched off their phones to save pow"

World number 46 Vinci served for the match at 5-4 in the second set but her nerve failed her at the crucial time. ""It was a day when nothing was going (right),"" Safina told reporters. ""Everything was going all over the place. ""So I just accepted it. I thought that if I lose I just have to forget this match as soon as possible, because it makes no sense. It's not me, not my normal game."" With Safina spraying the ball everywhere, Vinci took advantage to lead by a set and 3-0. Top seed Safina called for her coach and after a quick consultation, things began to change for her and she got back on level terms at 3-3. Nevertheless, Vinci broke again to lead 5-4 but could not serve out and the Russian snatched the set before recovering from a break down in the decider to clinch victory. ""At 3-0 I called my coach and he said maybe change the racquet,"" Safina said, adding that the humid conditions made the balls fly more than normal. ""Maybe also this helped me. ""Slowly I think she got tight. I don't know what happened to her because I was completely off. I guess she was not ready to beat me. She got afraid and things turned around."" French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova also survived a scare and two rain breaks to beat Czech Lucie Safarova 6-3, 6-7, 7-6 after two hours, 18 minutes. Third seed Venus Williams had no such problems, drilling eight aces as she crushed Olga Govortsova of Belarus 6-2, 6-2 to reach round three. Italian 14th seed Flavia Pennetta picked up where she left off after her title win in Los Angeles last week with a crushing 6-2, 6-3 first round victory over Japan's Ayumi Morita.

en.15.139.202.2009.8.13,Expert warns of 'preludes' to quake disaster,"Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh could be teetering on the verge of an earthquake disaster with two abutting tectonic plates heading for a clash, with high risk too of being inundated by a tidal wave, after a major 7.8 quake off the Andamans in the Indian Ocean triggered a tsunami alert this week and a subsequent medium 5.6 tremor jolted northern districts. ""Bangladesh is an earthquake prone area due to her geological and tectonic structures, especially Sylhet, Chittagong and Chittagong Hill Tract areas,"" geology professor Syed Humayun Akhter told bdnews24.com on Thursday. The northern region of Bangladesh lies above the seam of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates and the eastern part is above the joint of the Burmese and Indian plates. The Indian plate is edging north-east while the Burmese plate is moving north-west, say experts. Besides, the country is perched on three faults and a seismic gap. If an earthquake of more than 8 on the Richter scale occurs in Bangladesh or in India's Meghalaya, Assam, Manipur, Mizoram or in Myanmar the trail of damage will be colossal, said Akhter. The most at-risk areas in Bangladesh are over the Tangail-Modhupur fault, Sylhet's Dauki fault, Sitakundu-Teknaf fault Another major concern is the north-Andaman-Teknaf subduction zone, or seismic gap. Tsunami risk ""A seismic gap of 600 kilometres in the Bay of Bengal from north Andaman to Teknaf contains enough energy to cause an earthquake measuring over 7.5 in the Richter scale,"" said Prof Akhter, also in charge of the Earth Observatory at Dhaka University. The Indian Ocean quake on Tuesday, Aug 11, occurred in the Andaman-Teknaf subduction zone. ""It shows the subduction zone is active and could generate a devastating tsunami in the near future,"" said Akhter. On Dec 26, 2004, a massive underwater quake measuring 9.3 caused a huge tidal wave or tsunami in the western Bay of Bengal. It was the second biggest earthquake recorded in the region and was caused by friction between the Indian and Burmese plates. Bangladesh was safe during the 2004 tsunami because the direction of the friction was north-south giving rise to a east-west moving wave. But the fracture of the Teknaf-Andaman seismic gap is along a north-east to south-west direction. If a tsunami is generated in the Bay of Bengal from this subduction zone, it will directly assail the coastal areas including Barisal, Patuakhali, Noakhali, Cox's Bazar and Snadwip and India's Orissa, West Bengal, said Akhter. ""Our coast is only 750 km away from Teknaf-Andaman seismic gap. A tsunami generated there will take only one hour to reach the coast and the impact will be colossal because of the low plain lands of Bangladesh,"" he said. 'Preludes to serious quake' A few hundred minor earthquakes in different parts of the country in recent years can also be seen as preludes to a serious one, said Akhter. The earthquake on December 20, 2000, near capital Dhaka indicated that a major earthquake is on its way, he said, adding that unplanned urbanisation in Dhaka and other cities would lead to catastrophic loss of life. ""Around a dozen quakes recorded at the Modhupur fault in September last year are also deemed as foreshocks of a major quake,"" said Akhter. ""The devastating earthquakes in Pakistan and Sumatra over the last few years are a warning bell for us too,"" said Akhter. Besides mountainous areas, there are many faults in plain lands too, he said. ""Most areas of the country consist of low plain lands and soft silt. If a major earthquake occurs the disaster will be a calamitous liquefaction,"" he said. Roger Bilham, geology professor at the Colorado University of USA, has also confirmed seismic gaps in a number of places at the foot of the Himalayas and predicted several earthquakes measuring 7 and 8 Richter scale in the region in the near future. Clashes have been more frequent in recent times between the Indian and Eurasian plates and the Burmese and Indian plates. The Indian plate lies under Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh is located at a joint of a part of the Indian plate and three other plates in the north-east. The first earthquake to be properly recorded in Bangladesh was in 1548. A major quake struck the Chittagong-Burma coast in 1762 that caused a number of islands to sink into the Bay of Bengal and sprouted two mud-volcanoes at Sitakundu Hill and Teknaf that rose 1.5 to 2 metres above the sea level. ""Probably, the 1762 earthquake was the first recorded underwater quake in this region giving rise to a tsunami,"" said Akhter. Bangladesh has seen six earthquakes measuring 7 or more on the Richter scale since records began, in Sylhet, Srimangal, Manikganj and Chittagong. Generally an earthquake below 5 in magnitude occurs every one and a half years. A major earthquake occurs after 100 years. ""An earthquake is hard to forecast like any other natural disasters. But we can minimise the impact by increasing awareness,"" he said. The overall preparation of the earthquake can be divided into three parts  pre-quake preparation, preparation during the quake and post-quake preparation. Akhter suggested preparing seismotectonic maps to earmark earthquake prone areas, collecting data on regular tremors and upgrading the national building code. Training on earthquake preparedness in schools and rehearsals on self-defence will also be useful, he said. bdnew"

England were punished for two blunders at the back in the first half as they fell 2-0 behind through opportunist strikes from Dirk Kuyt and Rafael van der Vaart. England improved greatly after the break and speedy substitute Defoe beat the Dutch defence to poke home before sliding in an equaliser with 13 minutes remaining. ""I am not angry about the mistakes we made for the goals -- they were just silly mistakes,"" Capello told reporters after an entertaining match. ""I spoke with the players about it and such mistakes are possible when you are under pressure. ""It is better we made them tonight than during a World Cup qualifier,"" the Italian added. In the 10th minute striker Kuyt intercepted a sloppy backpass from Rio Ferdinand before calmly sidestepping goalkeeper Rob Green to open the scoring. Another poor short pass, this time from Gareth Barry, allowed the Dutch their second in the 37th minute when Van der Vaart shot into an empty net after Green had parried Arjen Robben's shot. England, without the injured Steven Gerrard, began the match with wingers David Beckham and Ashley Young but it was only after the introduction of Shaun Wright-Phillips and James Milner that they started to threaten. ""We faced problems when England played more offensively,"" Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk told reporters. ""Before the break they lacked speed with Beckham and (Emile) Heskey but in the second half we came under pressure and didn't handle that well."""

The H1N1 flu outbreak, declared a pandemic on June 11, has spread around the world since emerging in April and could eventually affect 2 billion people, according to WHO estimates. But is India ready to tackle the outbreak?

en.15.139.2.2009.8.14,"US senator in Myanmar, following Suu Kyi verdict","YANGON, Aug 14,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US senator arrived in Myanmar on Friday and a government source said he would meet the leader of the country's junta, which was condemned by the United States this week for the trial of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Jim Webb, chairman of a Senate subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific affairs, arrived in Naypyidaw, the Southeast Asian country's remote new capital, and would meet leader Than Shwe on Saturday, said the source who declined to be named. Webb is the first member of Congress to travel in an official capacity to Myanmar in more than a decade, and has also been described as the first senior American official ever to meet Than Shwe. It is unclear what he aims to achieve. He arrives the same week that Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate and a symbol of the movement for democracy in Myanmar, was sentenced to another 18 months' house arrest for violating a security law. The US embassy in Myanmar has little knowledge of Webb's plans and says all arrangements were made by his office in Washington. According to some reports, he may press for the release of John Yettaw, the American who swam uninvited to Suu Kyi's lakeside home in May. The authorities said his two-day stay there breached the terms of her house arrest, which led to her trial. Yettaw himself was sentenced to seven years' hard labor in a parallel trial on Tuesday on three charges, including immigration offences and ""swimming in a non-swimming area."" His health is fragile and he spent several days in hospital this month. President Barack Obama said the conviction violated universal principles of human rights and called for her release. In May, Obama extended a ban on US investment in Myanmar first imposed in 1997 because of the authorities' repression of the opposition. He has also renewed sanctions targeting imports from Myanmar. Before Suu Kyi's trial ended, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held out the prospect of better relations with Myanmar but made that conditional on the release of Suu Kyi and other political prisoners. Webb's office said on August 6 he would travel to five countries in Southeast Asia on a two-week mission ""to explore opportunities to advance U.S. interests in Burma (Myanmar) and the region."" He is not expected to be allowed to see Suu Kyi in her Yangon home, but the military government has invited members of political parties, including senior members of her National League for Democracy, to Naypyidaw this weekend. Webb flew to Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from Laos and will also visit Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. He is a former US Navy Secretary and a Vietnam War veteran who speaks Vietnam"
en.15.139.308.2009.8.13,Germany and France exit recession,"BERLIN/PARIS ,Aug 13,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany and France achieved a shock return to economic growth in the second quarter of the year, ending their recessions earlier than many policymakers and economists expected, but failed to drag the euro zone with them. German gross domestic product rose by 0.3 percent in the second quarter, bringing an end to the country's deepest recession since World War Two. French GDP also grew by 0.3 percent in the second quarter. The consensus in a Reuters poll of economists had predicted a 0.3 percent quarterly contraction in both countries. ""The data is very surprising. After four negative quarters France is finally coming out of the red,"" French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde told RTL radio. But in the 16-nation euro zone, GDP slid by 0.1 percent on the quarter, following a 2.5 percent drop in the first quarter. That, though, was well above the 0.5 percent fall forecast before the French and German figures were released. ""Looking forward, we think that the (euro zone) economy will increasingly benefit from the pick up in the global economy and the fact that the most aggressive phase of destocking is now behind us,"" said Nick Kounis at Fortis Bank. ""The big picture will be one of ongoing gradual recovery through 2010."" Germany suffered a calamitous 3.5 percent contraction in the first quarter of this year to cap four quarters of decline while the French economy shrank by 1.3 percent. European shares and the euro climbed while euro zone government bond futures dropped after the figures fueled optimism about the outlook for the single currency bloc. Aside from the euro zone's big two economies, other member nations continue to contract -- Italy's economy dropped by 0.5 percent in the second quarter, Austria and Belgium shrank by 0.4 percent and the Netherlands contracted by 0.9. Greece and Portugal, though, grew by 0.3 percent. RECOVERY AT LAST? Evidence is mounting that the worst of the damage wrought by a global financial crisis, which began with a U.S. housing market meltdown in 2007 and took a turn for the worse last year when U.S. bank Lehman Brothers collapsed, is now over. ""The recession has ended. Not just in Germany. The post-Lehman global confidence shock has receded. Firms are investing again,"" said Joerg Kraemer at Commerzbank. The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday the U.S. economy was showing signs of leveling out two years after the onset of the deepest financial crisis in decades. It was the first time since August 2008 its statement had not characterized the economy as contracting or weakening. The Bank of England struck a slightly more subdued tone in its quarterly inflation report on Wednesday, saying Britain's recession would end early next year. Britain now looks in relatively poor shape, its economy having shrunk by 0.8 percent in the second quarter. In France, the second quarter rise was supported by solid consumer spending, which has been propped up by government stimulus measures ranging from tax breaks to car trade-in schemes, and a surprise turnaround in exports. Year-on-year, German GDP fell by 7.1 percent in the second quarter, following a 6.4 percent drop in Q1. The government expects the economy to contract by some six percent this year but the Economy Ministry had already said the economy probably stabilized in the second quarter. ""The figures should encourage us,"" German Economy Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg said in a statement. ""However, there are no grounds for euphoria, because we're still a long way from seeing the economy back at the level that it was at last year."" REASONS TO BE CAUTIOUS Experts also remain cautious with budget deficits spiraling under the weight of government stimulus packages and unemployment levels set to climb for some time. ""If firms decide to start firing people in the autumn rather than putting them on shorter hours, it's going to have a negative impact on wages and hit consumption (in Germany),"" said Christian Dreger of the DIW economic institute. Banks in many countries also remain in poor shape, reliant on state support and reluctant to lend. ""There are lots of problems we haven't solved,"" said Jens-Oliver Niklasch, analyst at LBBW. ""As long as it's not clear that the banks' capital base is robust, we can't assume that the crisis is over."" But if nothing else, the prospect of a 1930s-style depression appears to have been banished. ""We had contracted so much over the past four quarters that a return to growth is almost mechanical,"" said Marc Touati at Global Equities in Paris. ""Still, it's good to see that we're not in a 1929 or 1930s type situation of total collap"

The United States wants to try Bout, dubbed the ""Merchant of Death,"" on terror charges related to suspected plans to sell arms to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC). The decision means Bout, who was arrested in Bangkok in March last year in a Thai-US sting operation, will remain in prison until the Appeal Court decides whether or not to accept the case. If it decides against, he will be released. ""The court received our intention to appeal today. Now we've got 30 days to formally submit our case,"" Thai prosecutor Sophon Kasempiboonchai told Reuters. The judge ruled on Tuesday that Thailand could not extradite Bout because the charges were not applicable under its laws. He said the case was political and, unlike the United States, Thailand did not recognize the FARC as a terrorist group. The United States expressed disappointment at the ruling and said the charges were relevant and in accordance with an existing extradition treaty with Thailand. Russia said it was satisfied with the decision and hoped Bout would be freed soon. US prosecutors say Bout had been trafficking arms since the 1990s, using a fleet of cargo planes to deliver weapons to fuel conflicts in Africa, South America and the Middle East. According to the US indictment, Bout told undercover agents he could supply them with 700 to 800 surface-to-air missiles, 5,000 AK-47 assault rifles, millions of rounds of ammunition, C-4 explosives, land mines and unmanned aerial dro"

""Russia has invited a Bangladeshi delegation to visit their nuclear power plants,"" said the official, who asked not to be named but was closely involved with the negotiations. A nine-member delegation is slated to visit in October, he said. He said a proposal had been sent to the prime minister for approval regarding the visit, which is likely to be headed by state minister for science and ICT Yafes Osman. Bangladesh and Russian signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) in Dhaka in May this year, on the peaceful use of nuclear power, which was seen as a first-step towards construction of a Bangladeshi nuclear power plant. Chairman of the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, Dr Mosharaf Hossain, and deputy-director general of the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation (Rosatom), NN Spasskiy, signed the deal. The MOU covers the design, licensing, construction, operation and maintenance of nuclear power and research reactors. It also provided guidelines for joint initiatives in exploration and extraction of uranium deposits and radiation waste management. Russia had not specified any financial terms as yet, but they are interested in providing loans rather than grants, which are likely be on favourable terms, said the ministry official. ""The Economic Relation Division will settle the financial terms and conditions once the MoU is signed,"" he said. Bangladesh also has similar MoUs with the USA and China. Bangladesh's one and only initiative to install a nuclear power plant in Rooppur, Pabna, has remained stalled since 1961. Russia built 10 nuclear power plants last year, and in total has constructed 65 plants in Iran, India, China, Armenia, Ukraine, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Bulgaria and Germany.

Soldiers killed at least 30 guerrillas during an assault on Wednesday on a base of Abu Sayyaf rebels in the interior of the southern island of Basilan, Brigadier-General Rustico Guerrero, marine commander, told reporters. ""Based on this one incident alone, it would be premature to make a conclusion on the neutralization of the Abu Sayyaf,"" Mars Buan, an analyst at the Pacific Strategies and Assessments risk consultancy, told Reuters. ""In the past, the Abu Sayyaf has suffered bigger number of casualties, but it has remained as one of the serious threats in the south."" Twenty-three soldiers were killed and 20 were wounded in eight hours of fighting, Guerrero said, describing it as one of the biggest battles since 2007, when 15 soldiers and 40 rebels were killed on Basilan. ""We launched a decisive law enforcement operation targeting the Abu Sayyaf's main training base on Basilan, but we were met by heavy resistance,"" he said. The guerrillas fled into the island's heavily wooded interior, said Rear Admiral Alexander Pama, navy commander on Basilan. Security forces on Thursday resumed pursuit operations against remnants of the 150-man rebel group. ""It was close quarter combat, the two sides almost came into hand-to-hand battle,"" Pama told Reuters. He said the proximity meant the military could not call in air strikes. ""What's more important for us was we've disrupted their crude bomb factory and training base."" UNHOLY ALLIANCE Analysts expected intensified operations against the Abu Sayyaf, but foresaw no decisive development in the conflict. Buan said the Abu Sayyaf's loose structure meant an encounter on Basilan would not affect militants on nearly Jolo island. Rex Robles, a retired navy commodore and a security analyst, said the rebels were both familiar with the territory and enjoyed the support of the local community. ""There are so many armed groups operating there, not just the Abu Sayyaf,"" Robles said. ""I would not be surprised if some rogue members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front come to the aid of the Abu Sayyaf. Some of them are related by blood and marriage."" The Abu Sayyaf is the smallest but most deadly of several Muslim groups fighting for independence in the south of the Roman Catholic state. It is estimated to have about 350 hard-core followers based mostly on Basilan and Jolo. It has links with Jemaah Islamiah, a pan-Asian radical Muslim group blamed for attacks in Indonesia, including the 2002 Bali bombings and the bombings of two hotels in Jakarta last month. Abu Sayyaf is blamed for the worst militant attack in the Philippines, the sinking of a ferry in Manila Bay in 2004 in which 100 people were killed. It has also been in the spotlight for high-profile kidnappings, most recently of three Red Cross officials on Jolo who were later freed.

Developing nations accused the rich of failing to take the lead in making deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and of trying to get poor to take on too much of the burden. China and India want the rich, for instance, to make cuts in greenhouse gases of at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 to avert the worst of climate change such as floods, droughts, heatwaves and rising sea levels. They say they need billions of dollars in aid and clean technology to help cope. ""We still have the same problems that have been hindering us,"" China's climate ambassador Yu Qingtai told Reuters of the rich-poor deadlock. He said that China was keen to see it emissions peak but that fighting poverty had to remain an overriding priority. Many delegates said that a meeting of world leaders at the United Nations in New York and a meeting of leaders of the Group of 20 in Pittsburgh, both in September, could help give guidance and break the deadlock. The European Union also said that offers on the table by developed nations fell far short of a goal of limiting global warming to a maximum of two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. ""When we sum them up we find they are gravely insufficient,"" said Anders Turesson, the chief negotiator of Sweden which holds the EU presidency. ""They would lead us into a three degree world,"" he said. The EU has promised cuts of 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, or 30 percent if other rich nations also make similar cuts. He also said that developing nations had to show ""more engageme"
en.15.139.109.2009.8.13,Govt moves to charge Matin,"Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)The government will move to charge former shipping adviser MA Matin over alleged irregularities in a container handling deal at Chittagong port, shipping minister Shahjahan Khan said on Thursday. Khan told bdnews24.com that his ministry would follow the recommendations by the parliamentary standing committee on shipping and refer the case to the Anticorruption Commission to press charges against Matin over the ""massive irregularities"" in awarding a contract to Esack Brothers on the former adviser's last day in office on Jan 6 this year. Committee chairman Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury told bdnews24.com earlier in the day that they had submitted the recommendations to the shipping ministry on Wednesday. Matin, a retired major general who was a director general of the Bureau of Anti-Corruption, the ACC's predecessor, has maintained all along that he did nothing wrong. Chowdhury's standing committee formed a three-member sub-committee on May 27 to investigate the allegations against Matin, who was also home adviser and chief of the corruption-busting national committee formed by the past military-installed caretaker government. Chowdhury presented the findings of the probe body at a press conference at the parliament building on Thursday. Chowdhury told bdnews24.com before the press conference, ""The committee has recommended the ministry refers the irregularities to the Anticorruption Commission to file a case against former adviser MA Matin, former shipping secretary Sheikh AK Motahar Hossain and six other public servants."" ""The committee has also suggested taking departmental actions against the public servants involved in the dealing."" ""Besides, we have asked the ministry to realise Tk 8 crore from them for causing loss to the public exchequer,"" he said. Chowdhury said the committee also suggested cancelling the contract with Esack Brothers. The allegations Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that the parliamentary probe body had found Matin had a direct role in awarding a container deal to a company in violation of the government guidelines. Chowdhury said the tender was not invited in line with the government rules and the CPA did not hold any board meeting before awarding the contract. He said a false certificate was given in favour of Esack Brothers, a ""novice"" company, and the tendering process caused financial losses to the public exchequer. Chowdhury also said that shipping officials involved in the deal had confessed to the panel that Matin forced them to award the contract in violation of government rules. Mohammed Shah Alam, who heads the sub-committee, told bdnews24.com that they had enough papers that pointed to Matin's involvement in the corruption and had therefore not summoned the former adviser to defend himself against the charges. AL's Shamsul Haq and Nazrul Islam Babu and BNP's Mostofa Kamal Pasha were the other members of the all-party parliamentary probe body. The evidence Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that according to the probe report, the tender evaluation committee chief Jobayer Ahmad had been in Dhaka on leave in early January ""to avoid awarding the contract to Esack Brothers which had no experience in container handling work"". ""The chairman of Chittagong Port Authority sent traffic manager Omar Faruq, who flew to Dhaka by air, to get Jobayer's signature on the tender document."" Chowdhury, quoting a written statement by Jobayer, said, ""On January 5, 2009, the chairman of Chittagong Port Commodore RU Ahmed told Jobayer by telephone that there was pressures from the adviser (Matin) and the secretary (Motahar) for awarding the work before the elected government took office (on Jan 6)."" The standing committee chairman said the adviser cancelled a tender in which Everest Enterprise was the lowest bidder. But the port authority floated a ""re-tender"" at the behest of adviser Matin. ""As per the public procurement rules, 2003, none can change the terms and conditions of the previous tender in case of re-tender. ""Instructed by the adviser, the ministry changed tender papers in 14 sections of the previous tender just to award the contract to Esack Brothers,"" said Chowdhury. The sub-committee's probe found that Matin had allegedly arranged a board meeting of the CPA in the afternoon of Jan 5 to evaluate the tender committee's report. The CPA moved the file to award the contract within 24 hours to Esack Brothers after the meeting and couriered it to Dhaka by air, the sub-committee said. The file was accepted on Jan 6 morning, and the same was sent to the port authority for necessary actions after the adviser had signed it. The file reached Chittagong in the afternoon of Jan 6 and the port authority awarded the work to Esack Brothers at 9am as the new government was being sworn in at Bangabhaban. Chowdhury, however, maintained that the probe body had not found any proof of the adviser taking bribes. Accused officials Besides Matin, the other accused officials are Sheikh AK Motahar Hossain, former shipping secretary (now working as a member of the privatisation commission), Abdul Matin, former joint-secretary to shipping ministry (now posted as joint secretary to industries ministry), Sharif Md Masud, former senior assistant secretary (now posted as senior assistant secretary at agriculture ministry), Commodore R U Ahmed, chairman of Chittagong Port Authority, Md Harun Mia, Chittagong Port Authority Member (finance), Ehsanul Kabir, Chittagong Port Authority director (transport), Golam Sarwar, Chittagong Port Authority's deputy traffic manager (ICD) and K M Moazzem Hossain, Chittagong Port Authority's deputy traffic manager (administration). Matin was the first adviser to the 2007-2008 caretaker government to face corruption charges after the Awami League government took office. Housing and public works adviser Moinul Hosein has since come under parliamentary scrutiny for allegedly awarding public land to his wife and son in violation of government rules."

""I think what I did well was even when my level was a little bit up and down, mentally I stayed focused. That's what I am really happy with."" Bartoli was stunned by the standard of play that Clijsters produced. ""Two years without playing a match -- it's pretty amazing the level she has already right now,"" she said. ""I guess the level of play, yes, it's inside the top 10 already. I can tell you that. ""The way she was moving and hitting and her physical strength after two years without playing a match it's just amazing."" Bartoli's feelings were echoed by three members of the world's top ten. ""I think she will do top 10 for sure,"" French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova told Reuters. ""She seems exactly the same as she was before. I think it's great she comes back and I think tennis needed somebody like this. ""I am really excited. There are not many girls who really had a birth of a child and came back."" MAJOR FORCE Clijsters, whose only Grand-Slam singles title came at the US Open in 2005, topped the world rankings for the first time in 2003 and enjoyed two other spells at the top. Since the retirement fellow Belgian Justine Henin last year, in May of last year, no player has dominated the women's game and Venus Williams believes Clijsters can be a major force. ""I think it's great. I think she's happy to be back and be here and I hope it goes really well for her,"" the American said. ""I think she will do well, definitely. She's a great athlete and a great competitor."" Former world number one Jelena Jankovic said it would be nice to have Clijsters back in the locker-room.

The parliamentary standing committee on communications made the recommendation Tuesday as private operators, mainly in Southern districts, have been observing transport strikes in recent weeks demanding withdrawal of BRTC buses. The committee also entrusted seven MPs to help resolve the problems by holding talks with the private bus owners and the local administration. Private bus operators were most recently observed transport strikes in Khulna, Pirjpur, Jhalakathi and Bagerhat districts demanding withdrawal of the BRTC buses. ""We have recommended restoration of BRTC bus services in the districts troubled by the transport strikes by the private operators,"" Sheikh Mujibor Rahman, the standing committee chairman, told journalists after a meeting at parliament. He said both the private owners and BRTC had the right to operate buses on the same routes. ""The committee has suggested the ministry procure more buses both for the city and district routes,"" said Golam Moula Roni, a member of the committee. Roni told reporters that the previous BNP government signed a deal with private operators to withdraw BTRC buses from the many inter-district routes. In the 7th parliament, several MPs, who were also bus company owners, including a chairman of a parliamentary standing committee, forced the government to strike the deal banning BRTC buses. The former communications minister Nazmul Huda had informed parliament about the agreement with the private bus operators at the time. But the military-installed caretaker government reintroduced BRTC buses on the routes after the promulgation of state of emergency on January 11, 2007. The private owners have been making similar demands again resulting in huge public suffering as intermittent strikes paralyse road communications in many districts."

Rubel is the third senior Bangladeshi bowler to be struck down through injury since the side departed for back-to-back tours in the West Indies and Zimbabwe in June. Skipper Mashrafe Bin Mortaza and left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak have already returned home and were replaced by Nazmul Hossain and Enamul Haque Jr respectively for the Zimbabwe series. Mashrafe fell awkwardly while bowling on the third day of the first Test against West Indies in St. Vincent last month, where he limped off the field and has been sidelined since. The paceman underwent successful arthroscopic surgery on both knees in Melbourne on Monday but will be out of action for at least six more weeks. Razzak was ruled out of Zimbabwe series after picking up a hamstring problem while batting in the third one-day international against the West Indies at St. Kitts. Two days later, Rubel suffered a side strain during the only Twenty20 International of that series. He travelled with the team to Zimbabwe but did not play.

Two truck bombs killed 25 people and wounded 75 near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, police said. Last week, a suicide car bomber killed 38 people as they left a Shi'ite Muslim mosque just outside Mosul, 390 km (240 miles) north of Baghdad. The truck bombs flattened some 30 homes in the predominantly Shia village of Khazna, 20 km (12 miles) north of Mosul. Bombings and shootings are reported almost daily in and around Mosul, capital of Nineveh province, where disputes between Arabs and Kurds threaten to split the region and inflame tensions that could threaten Iraq's long-term stability. In Baghdad, two car bombs targeting laborers killed 16 people and wounded 81 in predominantly Shia areas in the southwest of the capital, police said. The insurgency in Iraq has waned in the last 18 months, but has remained stubborn in Mosul and a few other areas.

Under a photograph of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sitting the previous day in the cockpit of an F-15I long-range fighter-bomber, mass-selling Maariv quoted the official as saying Israel could carry out such a strike without US approval but time was running out for it to be effective. Neither the official nor the paper made any comment on the likelihood of Netanyahu ordering such an operation, speculation over which remains a major risk factor in investors' assessments of the Middle East region and in energy markets globally. Israel rejects Tehran's assurances it is developing only civilian nuclear facilities and refuses to rule out armed force to stop its Islamist enemy acquiring atomic weaponry that the Jewish state says would threaten its very existence. Israeli air strikes could ""significantly delay"" such an arms programme, Maariv quoted the official as saying. That is in line with previous, independent analysts' assessments. Israel has backed efforts by US President Barack Obama to persuade Iran to curb its nuclear programme. Maariv said the official added there was ""no point"" in a strike in the near term, before such discussions had fully begun and before the Americans ""despair of the effectiveness of the talks"".

The advice follows reports of an eighteenth fatality from the virus in India, with states there deciding to shut schools, malls and cinema halls and nearly a thousand people testing positive for the virus in the neighbouring country. ""Doctors from Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Sir Salimullah Medical College hospital are now receiving additional training,"" Dr Mahmudur Rahman, director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), told bdnews24.com on Thursday. ""Training will be given serially to all doctors in the country,"" said Dr Rahman, who added that Bangladesh had good stocks of flu drug, Tamiflu. Two more cases of swine flu were also confirmed in Bangladesh on Thursday, taking the number of detected cases in the country to 36. According to IEDCR, 31 individuals infected with the H1N1 virus have now made a full recovery, while five more remain under surveillance. Twenty-four of the confirmed cases were infected overseas and the remainder contracted the virus within the country, according to the IEDCR. Dr Rahman said the newly confirmed cases were a mother and her child who had recently arrived in the country from Singapore. Screening measures were recently beefed-up in the country's 11 land ports, with India reporting fatalities and nearly a thousand confirmed cases. With the number of swine flu fatalities in India touching double figures on Tuesday, concerns are mounting. India is stocking up on Tamiflu, testing kits are being imported and private hospitals are being asked to help state-run hospitals cope with a surge in people rushing to get tested, say officials there. 'Hype' Some, however, feel that the media hype over swine flu is causing needless fear. On Tuesday, the Hindustan Times said the common flu could be killing an estimated 572 Indians every day, much more than H1N1 flu  which in most cases has been mild with most patients fully recovered. WHO declared a global H1N1 flu pandemic on June 11, while the health ministry confirmed the first case in Bangladesh on June 19. According to the World Health Organisation, as of Thursday, Aug 13, over 160,000 cases of swine flu have been detected in 161 countries worldwide, with 1,154 recorded fatalities. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. Bangladesh authorities advise schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu.

Three hours after the earthquake there were no reports of a tsunami or of any casualties from the tremor, officials said. ""We all ran out as fast as possible and have not gone back inside, fearing another quake. Everything was shaking, we are all very, very scared,"" Subhasis Paul, who runs a provision store in Diglipur island in North Andaman, told Reuters by telephone. ""People are calling each other out of their homes and everyone is huddled together outside,"" Paul said from Diglipur, about 300 km (185 miles) north of Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The small chain of islands lie hundreds of miles east of India in the Indian Ocean. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake, initially reported as a magnitude 7.7, struck at 1:55 a.m. (1955 GMT on Monday). It was relatively shallow, at a depth of 33 km (20.6 miles), and was centered 260 km (160 miles) north of Port Blair. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there could be a destructive wave along coasts up to 1,000 km (600 miles) from the epicenter, but it later withdrew its warning. ""Sea level readings indicate that a significant tsunami was not generated,"" it said in a statement. Officials at the tsunami alert center in southern India said chances of a tsunami were remote.

""We are monitoring the situation, but everything appears normal so far. It seems we have been lucky,"" added Rajesh, who goes by one name. A 7.6 magnitude quake is classified by the USGS as a major earthquake and is capable of widespread, heavy damage.

Top is believed to be the mastermind behind last month's near simultaneous suicide attacks on Jakarta's JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels which killed nine people and wounded 53. Police sources at the weekend were confident that Top had been killed, but widespread doubt had quickly emerged on whether they had got their man. Media reports quoting police sources have suggested Top probably fled the farmhouse in Temanggung, Central Java, about two hours before police raided the house. News that Top has managed to elude police again and remains on the run is a blow for Indonesian security forces and efforts to contain further attacks in Southeast Asia's biggest economy. The man killed in Central Java was identified as Ibrohim, who worked in the florist in the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Jakarta and is suspected to be the inside man on the attacks. ""We checked samples with (Ibrohim's) family in Cilimus and its a 100 percent match,"" Eddy Suparwoko, head of Indonesia's Disaster Victim Identification unit, told a news conference. Cilimus is a district in Cirebon in West Java. Police showed CCTV footage where Ibrohim, who called himself Boim at work, appeared to be surveying parts of the lobby and restaurant in the hotel. National police spokesman Nanan Soekarna described him as the ""field commander"" for the operations. Police said he had been a member of Jemaah Islamiah (JI) since 2000. ""He was the planner, organise, controller, operator of JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton bombings,"" added Soekarna. Top, who formed a violent wing of the JI militant network, is blamed for a series of attacks including on the JW Marriott in Jakarta in 2003, on the Australian Embassy in Jakarta in 2004 and in Bali in 2005."

Woods, in pursuit of his 15th major victory but first this year, birdied three of his last eight holes to finish a stroke in front of playing partner and defending champion Padraig Harrington. Twice champion Vijay Singh of Fiji, 2001 winner David Toms and fellow American Hunter Mahan, Australians Robert Allenby and Mathew Goggin and big-hitting Spaniard Alvaro Quiros were all on 69. Britain's Lee Westwood, who finished one stroke out of a playoff for last month's British Open won by American Stewart Cink, was among a group of eight on 70. Although the 7,674-yard layout is the longest to stage a major, Woods and company took advantage of its generous fairways and softened greens in hot, humid conditions. ""The way the course is set up you can be a bit aggressive,"" Woods told reporters after recording his lowest opening round at the PGA Championship since firing a 66 at Valhalla in 2000. ""I played really well today and felt very comfortable with what I was doing. It's always nice to get off quick. In the first round you can play yourself out of a golf tournament but you certainly can't win the tournament on the first day. ""I hit a bunch of good shots and this round could have been really low,"" he added after reaching 15 of 18 greens in regulation. ""I missed a bunch of putts out there."" Woods, champion in 1999, 2000, 2006 and 2007, totalled 29 putts including three from 20 feet or more. Allenby echoed the thoughts of many in the 156-strong field about the American's blemish-free performance. WORLD'S BEST ""Obviously he's the best in the world so we expect him to win,"" the Australian said after recording five birdies and a double-bogey seven at the 15th after finding a plugged lie in a fairway bunker off the tee. ""But you know what, it's three more days to go and a lot can happen. There are a lot of good golfers behind him."" Irishman Harrington, who clinched last year's title by two shots at Oakland Hills, relished his high-profile grouping with Woods in front of huge galleries. ""It puts you under a bit more pressure,"" the three-time major winner said after hitting five birdies and a lone bogey at the par-four first. ""You have to go to a new level. It pushes you on and that's what I like."" Harrington is bidding for his first victory on either the PGA or European tours this season after working hard on refining his downswing over the last eight months. Singh, champion at Sahalee in 1998 and Whistling Straits in 2004, was among the best of the afternoon starters and soared up the leaderboard with five birdies and two bogeys. ""I drove it really well ... and the putting was good,"" the former world number one said after picking up two shots in his last three holes. Several big names, however, failed to take advantage. American Phil Mickelson, the 2005 champion at Baltusrol, opened with a 74, US Masters champion Angel Cabrera of Argentina carded a 76 and Australian Adam Scott slumped to a"

The magnitude 6.5 quake centred around 150 km southwest of Tokyo damaged the main motorway south from the capital and prompted a brief suspension of high-speed train services, but there were no reports of major casualties. ""I was sleeping and there was a big jolt right at the beginning, so I leapt out of bed,"" said Rieko Yoshizaki, 57, in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka prefecture, near the epicentre. ""I was surprised ... and I hugged my dog."" Public broadcaster NHK said 81 people suffered injuries, most of them minor, from the 5:07 a.m. (2007 GMT, Monday) tremor. The quake, with a focus 20 km below the surface of Suruga Bay in Shizuoka prefecture, had a preliminary magnitude of 6.5, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. The Tomei Motorway that runs between Tokyo and Nagoya was closed by a landslide and the weather agency warned that heavy rain since Monday meant further slips were possible. Those storms have killed at least 13 people in Japan, with a further 15 missing. TV pictures from Shizuoka showed glass bottles shattered on the floor of a convenience store, a TV newsroom with videotapes thrown from shelves, and a temple where tiles had been shaken off the roof and were scattered on the ground. It was the second strong quake in Japan since Sunday evening and came shortly after a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean. NUCLEAR PLANT HALTS Chubu Electric Power Co automatically halted operations at its nuclear plant in Hamaoka, Shizuoka, after the quake, which briefly cut power to more than 9,000 homes. ""There was a boom that woke me up,"" said Yukari Yamamoto, 43, a housewife in Shizuoka. ""It shook sideways several times. Some letters fell off from the shelf but there was no big damage in the house."" Shares of construction companies such as Obayashi Corp gained on hopes they would gain work from reconstruction efforts after the storms and earthquake. Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas. The country accounts for about 20 percent of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater. In October 2004, a magnitude 6.8 quake struck Niigata in northern Japan, killing 65 people and injuring more than 3,000. An elderly resident compared Tuesday's tremor to 1923's Great Kanto quake that killed more than 140,000 people in Tokyo. ""It was big enough to wake me but not big enough to push me off the bed. My son and the family rushed down from upstairs and gathered in my room,"" said 93 year old Miyako Shiraishi. ""It was certainly scary, but not so much compared with the Great Kanto earthquake. At the time my parents had a store in Tokyo and it was disastro"

Rashedullah, director of drug rehabilitation centre 'Jiboner Alo', said a Jubo League leader, known locally as Shafiq, demanded Tk 50,000 from him in the name of contributing to a Aug 15 National Mourning Day programme to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's death anniversary. ""On Wednesday, Shafiq and some other men came to the centre to collect the demanded money, and failing to secure the sum they wrecked the centre and beat three of the staff,"" Rashedullah told bdnews24.com. ""They stole some cash and mobile phone sets before they left."" Rashedullah said the gang also vandalised a nearby contractor's office. Hafizuddin, sub-inspector of Rayerbazar Police Camp, however, had a different version of events. He told bdnews24.com, ""We heard that a boy was beaten up in the drug centre and Shafiq went to his aid. Later some unknown people vandalised the place."" ""The director of the centre told me that Shafiq had demanded money from him, but he did not submit any writtten complaint,"" Hafizuddin said. Mominur Rahman Sikder, vice-president of Jubo League's Ward 43 unit, said Shafiq was not a member of the pro-Awami League organisation and had apparently tried to take advantage of the Jubo League name. A volunteer at the drug centre said the same gang had previously demanded extortion money, but failed to collect due to the intervention of a local commissioner. bdnew"

In his first match since lifting a record 15th grand slam singles title at Wimbledon, much has changed in a few weeks for Federer, who arrived in Montreal with his wife Mirka, new born twin daughters Charlene Riva and Myla Rose and a nanny in tow. Ranked 487th, Canadian Niemeyer had hoped a few sleepless nights would help level the odds against the world number one. But an opponent on diaper duty and the backing of a centre-court crowd of 11,000 could not save the 33-year-old in his final appearance at the tournament before retiring. ""I was happy with that performance today,"" Federer told reporters after launching his hardcourt campaign with his 20th straight win. ""After five, six weeks without a match you're just a little bit slow on your reaction, your return. ""Mirka is great, she handles it all well. Me too, I'm quite laid back and hands on (with the kids). It seems to be working so far."" The Swiss added: ""Today all-in-all I thought it was okay. I wish I could have gotten some more balls back on the return but that again was due to him serving (well)."" ERRATIC FEDERER While Federer declared himself mostly satisfied with his performance there was none of the brilliance that swept him to back-to-back grand slam wins at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. Throughout the 85-minute match, Federer struggled for form, spraying forehands wide and long and slamming routine overheads into the net. The first set failed to produce a break, Federer taking the opener in a tie-break 7-3. Niemeyer continued to battle in the second until Federer finally wore down the Canadian, earning the only break of the match to go up 4-3 before wrapping up proceedings. Third seed Andy Murray and number four Serb Novak Djokovic, also back in action for the first time since Wimbledon, advanced smoothly. Spain's Rafael Nadal prepared to open his title defence on Wednesday by playing doubles for the second consecutive day. Briton Murray, who can snatch the number two world ranking from Nadal with a decent run in Montreal, beat Frenchman Jeremy Chardy 6-4 6-2. Serbia's Djokovic battled past Canadian wildcard Peter Polansky 6-4 7-6. Eighth-seeded Russian Nikolai Davydenko also advanced with 7-6 7-6 win over Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu. World number 10 Fernando Gonzalez of Chile survived a scare, battling back to beat 679th-ranked Canadian Milos Raonic teenager 4-6 7-6 6-4 in a first-round meeting."

""It is possible to hold a fair election under a political government,"" Huda told reporters after opening a workshop titled '9th Parliamentary Election: A Critical Appraisal' on Wednesday. ""But in the past we saw voters suffer from insecurity during elections under political governments."" The main concern of election officials is to get logistical support from the administration and to ensure voters' security during polls, said the election chief. Huda said the EC is ready to hold elections under any administration if a free and fair poll and security of voters are ensured. ""The Election Commission will give its opinion on the matter if asked."" Deputy leader of the House Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, on June 28, asked parliament to consider revoking the caretaker government system. Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad and other MPs subsequently made the same proposal. 'Support the Electoral Process in Bangladesh', a project of the EC Secretariat, organised Wednesday's daylong workshop at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre, attended by EC officials, election specialists, foreign diplomats and the national and international observer organisations of the 9th parliamentary polls held on Dec 29 last year. The CEC told the workshop that the commission ""did not sit idle after holding a fair election"". The EC was being further strengthened by filling manpower shortages, setting up countrywide server stations and forming a comprehensive database, said Huda. He said the commission also has plans to hold discussions with political parties over how to make the elections more accountable, reforms of electoral laws and updating voter lists.

en.15.139.268.2009.8.14,EU doubts missing ship was victim of pirates,"BRUSSELS Aug 14,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission expressed doubt on Friday over whether a merchant ship which has been missing for more than a week had fallen prey to pirates as the vessel's operator had suggested. Its remarks added to the deepening mystery over the 4,000-tonne Arctic Sea, whose disappearance has baffled authorities across Europe and North Africa and prompted the Kremlin to send Russian warships to join the hunt. ""Radio calls were apparently received from the ship which had supposedly been under attack twice, the first time off the Swedish coast then off the Portuguese coast,"" a spokesman for the executive arm of the European Union told journalists. ""From information currently available it would seem that these acts, such as they have been reported, have nothing in common with traditional acts of piracy or armed robbery at sea,"" Martin Selmayr said. The Maltese-registered vessel, carrying a $1.3-million cargo of timber and a Russian crew, was supposed to have docked on August 4 in the Algerian port of Bejaia. It never arrived and is thought to have last made contact from the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of France. A wave of piracy has hit shipping off Somalia, and an international naval force patrols its coast in an effort to protect merchant vessels. But a hijacking in European waters would be almost unprecedented in modern times. Concerns over the safety of the 15-member Russian crew were raised after the Malta Maritime Authority said it received reports the ship had been boarded by armed men in masks posing as anti-drugs police in Swedish waters on July 24. Russia's navy denied a report on state television that the frigate Ladny was following a ship of a similar description in the Atlantic Ocean not far from Gibraltar. Relatives of the crew appealed to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in an open letter and demanded a criminal investigation into the vessel's disappearance, Russian media reported, but have now stopped speaking publicly about the c"
en.15.139.294.2009.8.12,KL says it will lift Bangladeshi workers ban once crisis eases,"Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)Malaysia has once again told Dhaka that it will lift a ban on visas for Bangladeshi workers, but only after the Southeast Asian nation overcomes its own economic crises caused by the global recession. The statement came Wednesday as Malaysian high commissioner Jamaluddin Bin Sabeh called on foreign minister Dipu Moni at her office. Neither the foreign minister nor the high commissioner spoke to waiting reporters after the meeting. The Malaysian government on March 10 this year cancelled 55,000 visas for Bangladeshi workers because of a ""politically sensitive"" statement made by a Bangladeshi diplomat. Foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes, whom the high commissioner met before calling on Dipu Moni, told bdnews24.com Wednesday, ""I raised the issue of waiver of the visa ban."" ""The high commissioner reassured us that the visa ban will be lifted as soon as Malaysia overcomes its own economic crises."" Quayes said the Malaysian prime minister, at a sideline meeting at the July 14-16 NAM summit in Egypt, assured prime minister Sheikh Hasina that the ban would be lifted. But Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Anifah Aman on July 23 told Dipu Moni at the sideline of the 16th ministerial meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum in Thailand that his government was maintaining the embargo on Bangladeshi workers. Aman said it would be lifted only after the recovery of Malaysian economic crises caused by the global financial meltdown. Around 500,000 Bangladeshis live and work in Malaysia. Bangladesh labour counsellor Talat Mahmud told a Malaysian TV channel last year that his country had no problem amid the world recession as 70,000 more Bangladeshis were going for jobs in Malaysia despite the economic slowdown. The counsellor told the same to Malaysia's state-run news agency, angering people and politicians in Malaysia, hard hit by the global economic meltdown. The far-eastern country subsequently sent back tens of thousands of Bangladeshis applying for work visas empty-handed. The Bangladesh labour counsellor was later withdrawn."

""We have sent strong messages that we would like these three young people released as soon as possible, and also others that they have in their custody as well,"" Jones told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" The Iranian government acknowledged on Sunday that it had the three Americans in its custody, he said. ""These are innocent people. We want their families reunited, and we would like to have it done as quickly as possible,"" Jones said. Iran detained the three Americans over a week ago after they strayed across the border from Iraq, according to an Iraqi Kurdish official. Jones did not elaborate on others in Iranian custody. But in a separate interview, Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the United Nations, mentioned Robert Levinson, an ex-FBI agent who disappeared in March 2007 during a business trip to Iran's Kish island. ""This (the hikers' case) is obviously of significant concern to us, as are the cases of other Americans who continue to be held in Iran. Mr. Robert Levinson, a number -- a couple of dual nationals who we're quite concerned about,"" Rice told CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""So we will continue to press for the swift and safe release of all Americans,"" Rice said. In his interview, Jones said Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ""is the figure of authority that we have to deal with"" in Iran, despite the recent political turmoil there. Ahmadinejad's recent re-election has sparked Iran's worst unrest since the 1979 Islamic revolution. At least 20 people were killed and hundreds were detained in the street unrest after the disputed June 12 poll.

Officials with the US Drug Enforcement Agency, which is assisting Los Angeles police in their investigation of the pop star's sudden death on June 25, said agents conducted the raid at a business called Applied Pharmacy Services. DEA spokesman Jose Martinez declined to say if the search was tied to Jackson's personal doctor, Conrad Murray, whose house and medical offices were raided last month in Houston and in Las Vegas. But Martinez did confirm that Tuesday's raid involves the probe into Jackson's death. Jackson suffered cardiac arrest and died at age 50. Since then, numerous media reports have said investigators are focusing on his use of prescription drugs, particularly the powerful anesthetic propofol, and Murray's possible involvement in providing it. On Monday, the Los Angeles County Coroner said it had completed its autopsy report on Jackson's body, but their findings remain under seal while police continue their investiga"
en.15.139.233.2009.8.11,Musharraf faces arrest if he returns to Pakistan,"ISLAMABAD, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former president Pervez Musharraf would face arrest if he returned to Pakistan after police registered a case against him on Tuesday over his detention of judges during a political crisis in 2007. The military dictator, who came to power in a coup in 1999, left Pakistan more than two months ago, having been forced to quit as president in August last year in order to avoid impeachment by a hostile parliament. ""He could either be arrested on his return or through Interpol,"" Hakam Khan, head of a police station in Islamabad where the case was lodged, told Reuters. If convicted he Musharraf could be jailed for three years, Khan said. This is the first time that such a case has been brought against a former military ruler. ""He detained judges and ousted them illegally so he has to be tried for his illegal and unconstitutional actions,"" Mohammad Aslam Ghuman, the lawyers who filed the case against Musharraf, told Reuters. Earlier this month the Supreme Court ruled that Musharraf had violated the constitution by imposing emergency rule and purging the judiciary in November 2007 in a desperate move to hold onto the presidency. The court left it up to parliament whether Musharraf, once a vaunted ally of the United States, should be tried for treason for his actions. With the knives out for him at home the old general has spent most of his time since late May in London and he is believed to be looking to settle in Europe. Outrage over the use of emergency powers and detention of opposition figures, including the judges, contributed to the defeat of Musharraf's allies in an election in 2008. The fragile civilian government is faced by acute economic and security crises, with the army fighting a Taliban insurgency in the northwest Although Musharraf is regarded as yesterday's man, the ruling coalition led by President Asif Ali Zardari's party has shown little appetite for prosecuting him. Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister Musharraf overthrew and Zardari's greatest rival, is pushing for his usurper to be brought to justice. But, analysts say the still powerful army would be uneasy if Musharraf's humiliation became too great, as many serving generals had backed him."

The agreement was signed between the country representative of the UK's Department for International Development Chris Austin and BRAC executive director of Dr Mahabub Hossain at the Uttar Korail BRAC Primary School in Gulshan's Korail slum, said a joint statement. Responding to a question as to why DfID was funding non-formal education, Chris Austin said, ""There are two reasons for this, firstly there is a need and secondly because the system of funding for education delivers the results."" Lauding the initiative by BRAC, he said costs were low and the output of education was similar to that from government run schools. He said, ""I am accountable to the UK for every pound spent and therefore we need to ensure that there is no waste."" ""The results are good and the accountability is sharp,"" he said. Dr Mahabub Hossain said, ""As part of an all inclusive education, our focus is on drop out students and those who have not gone to schools at all and though the infrastructure is not always top class, the standard of education is not compromised."" ""Working for the millennium development goal to achieve universal primary education, we provide an all inclusive, secular education and as a result the students are eager to learn,"" he added. Dr Mahabub Hossain also pointed to the fact that in a time of global recession, the fund from DfID would be 'extremely helpful' in sustaining the education programme. The fund will be used to provide support for the running of 30,000 pre-primary and 33,000 primary BRAC schools across the country and will benefit up to one million children. Part of the fund will also help strengthen the quality in primary and secondary schools, and the livelihoods and skill development training for adolescent and youth under BRAC's adolescent development and continuing education programme. Austin said DfID's support for education in Bangladesh also includes assiatance to the government through the Primary Education Development Programme II, support to skills development through the Underprivileged Children's Education Programme and English in Action."

en.15.139.419.2009.8.12,India's Industrial output surges to 16-month high,"NEW DELHI, Aug 12,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's industrial output expanded at its fastest pace in 16 months in June, beating forecasts by a wide margin, as higher salaries of government employees and stimulus spending boosted consumer demand. Economists said strong momentum in factory output could help mitigate the effects of a poor monsoon season on overall economic growth, but cautioned that the brisk rate of industrial activity might not be sustainable despite other recent positive signals. ""Although the June production number could well prove something of an aberration, bearing in mind just how strong it was, the trend in industrial output is clear,"" said Robert Prior-Wandesforde, senior Asian economist at HSBC in Singapore. Some economists have warned that growth in Asia's third-largest economy could be pared by as much as 2 percentage points this fiscal year if rainfall remains inadequate in the current sowing season. ""While the poor monsoon is creating justifiable concerns about agricultural sector output, which in turn is prompting some to revise GDP forecasts lower, today's release suggests there is plenty of momentum in the ex-agricultural sector,"" he said. Factory output in June rose 7.8 percent from a year earlier, expanding for the six straight month based on revised figures and outpacing a rise of 2.2 percent in May as New Delhi ploughed investment into infrastructure projects and spent more on rural jobs. The output growth rate is the highest since February 2008 and far exceeded the forecast of 3.3 percent in a Reuters poll of analysts. The 30-share BSE index pared losses but the rupee rose and then weakened slightly after the data, while benchmark bond yields rose marginally. At its policy review on July 28, the central bank raised its inflation forecast for the fiscal year through March to around 5 percent from 4 percent but also signalled its intention to stick to its policy of easy money for the near term as it helps the government manage a record $95 billion borrowing plan. Wednesday's strong industrial number would not be enough to trigger a move towards monetary tightening, said Gunjan Gulati, economist at JPMorgan Chase in Mumbai. ""We need to see continued and sustained strength in these economic indicators for the central bank to begin normalizing their policy stance,"" she said. Output of consumer durable goods such as home appliances and cars rose 15.5 percent from a year earlier as government employees put their heftier paychecks to work, while capital goods production grew 11.8 percent, indicating fresh investments. Mining output increased by 15.4 percent in June and manufacturing output rose by 7.3 percent, while electricity generation clocked an 8 percent growth. By comparison, China's industrial output in July grew an annual 10.8 percent, its highest in nine months but lagging forecasts, indicating that emerging economies were leading the global economic recovery. MONSOON CLOUDS OUTLOOK Total rainfall since June 1, the start of India's four-month monsoon season, has been 28 percent below normal and the government said on Tuesday that more than a quarter of the country's districts were prone to drought. With just over 40 percent of India's agricultural land irrigated, farm output is heavily reliant on rains and the shortfall could potentially hurt rural demand, which accounts for more than half of India's domestic consumption. India's economy grew at 6.7 percent last year after three straight years of growth of 9 percent or more. Analysts forecast growth in the current year of 5.8 to 7.2 percent, but some have warned that faltering rains pose a downside risk. ""It looks like industrial output is being driven by strong domestic demand, though the poor monsoons may have a restraining impact. But this shows recovery is well underway,"" said A. Prasanna, economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership. Data published earlier, including that of automobile production, had already indicated industrial output would expand in June, even though exports faltered. The infrastructure sector grew 6.5 percent from a year earlier after 2.8 percent in May. Exports fell an annual 27.7 percent in June to $12.8 billion, the ninth straight monthly fall. Weak exports augur poorly for manufacturing even though domestic consumption, at 57 percent of gross domestic product, accounts for the lion's share of total demand in India. Signs of expansion continued in July, with car sales rising by a blistering 31 percent and a survey by Markit Economics showing manufacturing activity expanded for the fourth consecutive mo"

A statement from the council of 27 EU states said members of the judiciary had been added to a list of officials of the military government subject to asset freezes and bans on travel to the European Union. A Myanmar court on Tuesday sentenced Suu Kyi, who has spent 14 of the past 20 years in detention, to three years in jail -- which the ruling junta then reduced to 18 months of house arrest at her lakeside home in Yangon. The EU has condemned the trial and verdict against Suu Kyi as ""unjustified"" and urged her unconditional release. The EU tightened sanctions on Myanmar after a crackdown on peaceful pro-democracy protests led by Buddhist monks in September 2007.

Support the Electoral Process in Bangladesh, a project of the EC Secretariat, organised the daylong workshop at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre, attended by EC officials, election specialists, foreign diplomats and the national and international observer organisations of the 9th parliamentary polls held on Dec 29 last year. The CEC told the workshop that the commission ""did not sit idle after holding a fair election"". The EC was being further strengthened by filling manpower shortages, setting up countrywide server stations and forming a comprehensive database, said Huda. He said the commission also has plans to hold discussions with political parties over how to make the elections more accountable, reforms of electoral laws and updating voter lists. He also said the current government was not meddling in the commission's affairs. More work plans would be implemented during the term of the current commission, said the elections chief. The incumbent Election Commission has completed half of its five-year term. bde"
en.15.139.67.2009.8.11,Tipai dam will spell humanitarian disaster: LSE meet,"By Syed Nahas Pasha London, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)--The planned unilateral construction of Tipaimukh Dam by India will have serious environmental, ecological, social and economic effects on the millions of people of Bangladesh and northeastern India, speakers at a conference at the London School of Economics warned. The conference, dubbed world forum, of the Voice for Justice World Forum on Sunday in London called upon the governments of Bangladesh and India to enter into a joint feasibility study before construction of any dam for a fair and equitable solution to the impending environmental catastrophe. It also underlined that as an upper riparian country India has a clear moral and legal obligation to consult Bangladesh before building any such dam. Convenor of the World Forum of the Voice For Justice, a global human-rights and justice organisation, Dr Hasanat Hussain MBE chaired the conference. British treasury minister Stephen Timms congratulated the organisers for convening its world forum in London. He told the conference that the British government will always stand by the oppressed all over the world and work with people's organisations such as VFJ to promote human rights and justice for the poor and marginalised. This was the first world forum of VFJ convened at the London School of Economics by a coalition of its European, US, Canadian and Asian chapters. It was participated, among others, by expatriate Bangladeshi academicians, experts, VFJ members and a wide cross-section of people from the British-Bangladeshi community in the UK. Abdul Moyeen Khan, former planning and science minister, and Sabih Uddin, former Bangladesh high commissioner to the UK, participated in the discussion via internet. Concerns were raised at the conference that the possible construction of any such obstruction to common rivers will create humanitarian crisis for millions of people who depend on the rivers Surma and Kushiara. A paper was also presented at the conference by Dr K M A Malik of University of Cardiff on Climate Change in South Asia with special reference to Bangladesh. The conference also deliberated on two separate papers on 'Rights of Migrants Workers in Gulf States' and 'Women's rights in Islam' presented by Dr Mahbub Khan of California State University and Hasan Mahmud, sirector of Sharia Law of Muslim Canadian Congress, respectively. Speakers stressed formal bilateral agreements between Bangladesh and other migrant-sending states with the migrant-receiving states in the Gulf, where serious allegations of violation of human rights and dignity of migrant works have been widespread. The conference called specially upon the migrant-receiving governments to respect and prioritise the human rights of migrant workers who contribute to their economies and also bring back millions of dollars in remittances for their home countries, and yet receive very little in minimum wages, working conditions, and job security in the host country. In his paper on women's rights and Sharia, Hasan Mahmud reaffirmed that Islam and the authentic Sharia promote and protect women's right in a most equitable and just manner. He regretted that the misinterpretation and distortion of these laws over time due to social and cultural biases have led to discriminatory treatment of women in many societies. Professor Anthony Booth, head of International Education, Christchurch University, Kent, UK, Prof. Shamsul Islam Choudhury of Roosevelt University, US, Dr. Abdur Rahman and Dr. Zakia Rahman of Limmeric University, Ireland, Dr. Stephanie Eaton of Kingston University, UK, Luthfur Rahman Choudhury and joint convenors of the World Forum of Voice For Justice from London, Kent, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Newcastle joined in the question and answer sessions at the end."

Senior metropolitan special judge ANM Bashirullah set Aug 30 for the next hearing, asking the accused to appear in the court that day. Jaynal Abedin Mesbah, lawyer for Khaleda told the court she could not appear in the court because of security concerns. He asked the court to issue an order to the government to ensure Khaleda's security. ""If security is ensured, Khaleda Zia would not have any problem appearing in the court,"" Mesbah said. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges in the court against Khaleda, her elder son Tarique Rahman and four others in the case on Aug 5. Khaleda, a two-time former prime minister, and the others face charges of embezzling more than Tk 2 crore by throwing up the Trust that allegedly exists only on paper. The four other accused in the case are former BNP MP Kazi Salimul Haque, Sharfuddin Ahmed and Mominur Rahman, a nephew of Khaleda, and Kamal Uddin Siddiqui.

The advice follows reports in the Indian media of an eighteenth fatality from the virus in the neighbouring country. ""Doctors from Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Sir Salimullah Medical College hospital are now receiving additional training,"" Dr Mahmudur Rahman, director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), told bdnews24.com on Thursday. ""Training will also be given serially to all doctors in the country,"" said Dr Rahman, who added that Bangladesh also had adequate stocks of flu drug, Tamiflu. Two more cases of swine flu were confirmed in Bangladesh on Thursday, taking the number of detected cases in the country to 36. According to IEDCR, 31 individuals infected with the H1N1 virus have now made a full recovery, while five more remain under surveillance. Twenty-four of the confirmed cases were infected overseas and the remainder contracted the virus within the country, according to the IEDCR. Dr Rahman said the newly confirmed cases were a mother and her child who had recently arrived in the country from Singapore. Screening measures were recently beefed-up in the country's 11 land ports, with Indian media reporting fatalities and over a thousand confirmed cases. According to the World Health Organisation, as of Aug 13, over 160,000 cases of swine flu have been detected in 161 countries worldwide, with 1,154 recorded fatalities. WHO declared a global H1N1 flu pandemic on June 11, while the health ministry confirmed the first case in Bangladesh on June 19.

en.15.139.213.2009.8.11,Verdict expected in Suu Kyi trial,"YANGON Aug 11(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The trial of Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is to resume on Tuesday amid heightened security around the prison where the hearing will take place. Her legal team said the hearing had been set for 10 a.m. (0330 GMT). If she is found guilty on security charges, as widely expected, the long-time leader of the pro-democracy movement in army-ruled Myanmar faces five years in prison. She has spent 14 of the past 20 years in detention of one sort or another. Witnesses said at least 2,000 security personnel were in the vicinity of Insein Prison, where she is being held and tried. State newspapers all ran the same commentary on Tuesday that implicitly warned Suu Kyi's supporters not to cause trouble and told outsiders not to meddle in Myanmar's affairs. ""The people who favor democracy do not want to see riots and protests that can harm their goal,"" said the commentary in the New Light of Myanmar and other newspapers. ""Anti-government groups inside and outside the nation and the United States are accusing the government of deterring Aung San Suu Kyi from standing for election,"" it added. ""The approved constitution and the forthcoming election law will decide who will be entitled and who will not be entitled to stand for election."" Critics say the trial has been trumped up by the military government as a way of keeping Suu Kyi out of circulation in the run-up to and during a multi-party election planned for 2010. The case stems from a bizarre incident in which an American, John Yettaw, swam to Suu Kyi's lakeside home in May. The prosecution says Yettaw's two-day stay at Suu Kyi's home, even though he was uninvited, meant she breached the terms of her house arrest and violated an internal security law. A verdict in the trial had been expected on August 4 but the judge adjourned the case until Tuesday, August 11, after Yettaw fell ill. However, he was moved back to his prison cell shortly before midnight on Monday, a hospital source said. Yettaw, 54, from Missouri, is on trial alongside Suu Kyi and two of her housemaids. He is charged with immigration offences and for swimming in a non-swimming area. Yettaw, a Mormon, has told the court God sent him to warn Suu Kyi she would be assassinated by ""terroris"
en.15.139.391.2009.8.11,Gas supply cuts to ensure Ramadan power,"Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to cut gas supplies to factories during peak hours over Ramadan in a bid to maintain uninterrupted power supplies for Iftar, Sehri and Tarabih Salah prayer times.

en.15.139.454.2009.8.14,Surma river already facing severe water crunch,"Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)Hundreds of water bodies and small rivers in the greater Sylhet region are already facing a water crisis during the dry season, according to Bangladesh Water Development Board, even before India has begun construction of the contentious Tipaimukh dam project upstream in Manipur that has triggered widespread environmental fears for the region. WDB officials said a huge shoal emerges every dry season, from November to April, at the mouth of the Surma river that is fed by the cross-border Barak river, over which the Indian government is planning to build its dam. ""The large shoal has been surfacing at the mouth of the Surma, at Amalshid in Sylhet, every dry season for some years past,"" Abul Kalam Mohd Azad, BWDB director general, told bdnews24.com on August 9. ""We have been trying to dredge the river-mouth to ease the river's flow,"" he said. But water board officials say they cannot clear the shoal since it lies in the ""no-man's-land"" on the Bangladesh-India border in Sylhet. They say Delhi is yet to give Dhaka the green signal to dredge the river's mouth. The cross border river Barak enters Bangladesh through Amalshid bifurcating into the Surma and the Kushiara. Because of the shoal at the Surma's mouth, the Barak waters now mainly drain through the Kushiara, rendering the Surma-dependent areas water-thirsty. The Surma criss-crosses the Sylhet and Sunamganj districts. Millions of farmers and fishermen are solely dependent on the water bodies and distributaries of the Surma for their livelihood. ""Hundreds of large and small rivers and other open water bodies in Sylhet and Sunamganj districts are fed by the Surma,"" Syed Ahsan Ali, a superintendent engineer of the Water Development Board in Sylhet, told bdnews24.com. ""In the dry season, they face water shortages as the shoal diverts waters to the Kushiara which now carries 80 percent of the Barak waters."" Syed Ahsan Ali was authorised to talk to bdnews24.com by the board's chief of planning Md Saidur Rahman. Rahman told bdnews24.com, ""We have requested the Indian government to undertake dredging in the Surma river."" BWDB director general Abul Kalam Mohd Azad said the shoal must be cleared as soon as possible, or massive silt deposits may soon choke the whole river. Surma flow data reveals a grim picture of the Surma river in the lean period (November to April) at Kanaighat, the Bangladesh Water Development Board's nearest observation point to the shared border with India. In 2006, the Surma's flow at Kanaighat in the dry season was 9.18 cumec per second in April while the lowest was 4.56 cumec per second on February 13. In the rainy season that year, the same river's highest flow at the same point was 1416 cumec per second on July 10 and the lowest 670 cumec per second in August. The Surma's highest and lowest flows in the lean period in 2007 were recorded in March. The highest flow in the dry season was just 4.6 cumec per second and the lowest 4.22 cumec per second. The same river's highest and lowest flows figures in the 2007 rainy season were recorded in August as 962 cumec per second and 670 cumec per second repectively. In 2008, the Surma's highest and lowest flow figures for the dry season were recorded in March. The lowest flow was 6.05 cumec per second while the highest was just 15 cumec per second. The highest flow in the rainy season the same year was 1456 cumec per second on July 21. The figures for 2009 are yet to be processed, said officials. Environmentalists in India and Bangladesh say the proposed Tipaimukh dam, on top of such a prevailing situation, will certainly cause ""environmental disaster"" both in the upstream and downstreamdespite repeated assurances by Delhi that it will not. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, who is scheduled to visit India in September, told bdnews24.com on August 12, ""I will discuss this further with the Indian government"". However, Sajjad Hossain, a member of the Joint Rivers Commission, which discusses river-related issues with India, refused to comment on the issue, when approached on Friday, telling bdnews24.com, ""I have nothing to say"". bdn"

en.15.139.327.2009.8.12,China urges world to respect Myanmar's sovereignty,"YANGON, Aug 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China said on Wednesday the world should respect Myanmar's judicial sovereignty after sending Aung San Suu Kyi back into detention, a ruling that triggered Western outrage but only a measured response from its neighbors. China, one of the few nations that stands by Myanmar's military junta, called for continued dialogue but urged non-interference from the outside world, suggesting Beijing would not back any United Nations action against the country. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, was sentenced to three years for violating an internal security law, but the junta said immediately after Tuesday's verdict it would halve the sentence and allow her to serve the time at her Yangon home. The verdict drew sharp criticism from leaders around the world. Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown called it ""monstrous."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said it was ""brutal and unjust"", and the European Union said it was preparing sanctions against the regime. Western nations pressed the UN Security Council to adopt a statement condemning the sentence, but other countries, including veto-wielding members Russia and China, stalled for time. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said dialogue, rather than criticism, would help steer Myanmar toward a path of democracy, development and national reconciliation. ""This not only accords with Myanmar's interests, it is also beneficial to regional stability,"" she said in a statement, China's first official comment following the sentencing. ""International society should fully respect Myanmar's judicial sovereignty,"" Jiang said, referring to Suu Kyi's case. Analysts said Suu Kyi's reduced sentence may have been an attempt to appease Myanmar's friends and neighbors -- China, India and Thailand, in particular -- whose trade has propped up a state crippled by international sanctions. ""Most Asian states will be prepared to go along with that,"" said Ian Holliday, a Myanmar specialist at the University of Hong Kong. ASEAN ""DISAPPOINTED"" The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Myanmar is a member, on Wednesday expressed ""deep disappointment"" about Suu Kyi's detention, following similar statements by member countries that stopped short of criticizing the regime. ASEAN maintains a policy of quiet diplomacy and non-interference in the internal affairs of its members, but the junta's refusal to improve its human rights record has been the main source of tension within the 10-member bloc. Critics have dismissed the trial as a ploy by the junta to keep the charismatic National League for Democracy (NLD) leader away from next year's multi-party elections, the first since 1990, when the NLD's landslide win was ignored by the generals. The charges stemmed from a bizarre incident in which an American John Yettaw swam to her lakeside home in May and stayed there uninvited for two days. That breached the terms of her house arrest and broke a now-obsolete security law protecting the state from ""subversive elements."" Yettaw was sentenced to seven years' hard Labour in a parallel trial on three charges, including immigration offences and ""swimming in a non-swimming area."" He told the court in May that God had sent him to warn Suu Kyi she would be assassinated by ""terrorists."" Myanmar's military, which has ruled the country with an iron fist for almost five decades, has consistently shown it is impervious to international criticism and reluctant to engage with the West. The generals insist next year's elections will be free and fair and will pave the way for a civilian government free of army control. However, few doubt their sincerity and critics dismiss the polls as an attempt to legitimize army rule. Debbie Stothard from the Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma said the reduced sentence and repeated delays in the Suu Kyi trial showed the junta feared isolation and had been affected by international opinion. ""What we saw was the regime delaying the process and reorganizing itself,"" she told Reuters. ""This is clear evidence the regime is sensitive to international pressure and a sign the world has to keep pushing"

en.15.139.463.2009.8.13,Stowaway mosquitoes threaten Galapagos wildlife,"By Ben Hirschler LONDON, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The unique wildlife of the Galapagos Islandsis under threat from disease-carrying mosquitoes arriving on board growing numbers of aircraft and tourist boats, researchers said on Wednesday. Experts fear the spread of the southern house mosquito, or Culex quinquefasciatus, could have the same devastating effect in the Galapagos as in Hawaii during the late 19th century, when disease wiped out many indigenous birds. The mosquito was first spotted in the Galapagos in the mid-1980s, but its presence then was considered a one-off. Now research by British and Ecuadorean scientists has found the insects are, in fact, transported regularly by plane and are island-hopping on boats, spreading throughout the archipelago. Genetic tests also confirm they are able to survive and breed once they arrive at their new home. ""More ships and more aircraft are coming to the Galapagos every year and the risk of something being introduced is growing all the time,"" said Leeds University researcher Simon Goodman. ""That we haven't already seen serious disease impacts in Galapagos is probably just a matter of luck."" The southern house mosquito is a carrier of diseases including avian malaria, avian pox and West Nile fever. It was brought to Hawaii in water barrels on whaling ships, leading to diseases that are blamed for wiping out many bird species. Only 19 out of 42 species and subspecies of honeycreeper now remain in Hawaii. Goodman and colleagues, who published their findings in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, fear everything is in place for a similar wipe-out in the Galapagos, given the rapid growth in transport links with the mainland. Tourism is a major source of income for the Galapagos and is growing by around 14 percent a year. The government of Ecuador recently introduced a requirement for insecticide spraying on aircraft flying to the Galapagos, but the scientists said the scheme's effectiveness was not being monitored and the rules did not apply to cargo ships. Mosquitoes are the latest in a string of invaders -- including rats, wild pigs, flies and invasive plants -- that have colonized the Pacific islands, located about 600 miles off South America's coast along the equator. British naturalist Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution in the 19th century after studying the islands' unique animal populat"

en.15.139.53.2009.8.11,Australia's Smith rejects China Rio report,"CANBERRA, Aug 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia brushed off on Tuesday a Chinese report accusing iron ore miner Rio Tinto Ltd of overcharging and spying on Chinese steel mills, saying it had not been officially sanctioned. In a growing war of words with its biggest export partner, Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith also delivered a veiled warning to China to rein in its diplomats after China's embassy tried to block a speech in Canberra on Tuesday by an exiled leader of China's Uighur Muslim minority. An article published online by China's state secrets agency at the weekend said Rio spied on Chinese mills for six years, resulting in the mills overpaying $102 billion for iron ore, Rio Tinto's biggest earner. ""It is now quite clear, given that the article has been taken off the website, that it was essentially the opinion of the individual writer, and not if you like officially sanctioned,"" Smith said. Smith said the report bore little relevance to the detention of Australian Rio Tinto executive Stern Hu and three other China-based staff of the Anglo-Australian company. The four were detained a month ago on suspicion of stealing state secrets, but they have yet to be officially charged. Rio Tinto's shares were some 2.2 percent lower at A$57.22 at midday on Tuesday, continuing a 3 percent slide the previous day amid investors nerves over the miner's relations with China. Australian diplomats had made a fresh appeal for China to grant legal representation to China-born Hu after they were allowed only their second visit to his Shanghai detention center late last week, Smith said. ""We were very pleased to see that his health and welfare continues to be in good order,"" Smith told state radio. Chinese newspaper the 21st Century Business Herald on Tuesday quoted Jiang Ruqin, the author of the article that laid out the Rio allegations, as saying it reflected only his own views. Jiang said his claim of losses from Rio's spying activities came from earlier media reports, but he did not reveal where he had got information that Rio had been spying for six years. The website (www.baomi.org) was inaccessible on Tuesday, but the article could be found on other Chinese-language websites. David Kelly, a professor of Chinese studies at the University of Technology, Sydney, speaking in Beijing, said it was unclear how much Chinese government weight was reflected in the article. ""I would suggest that at least it reflected a powerful view of at least part of the bureaucracy,"" said Kelly. In a further sign of brittle relations, the Chinese embassy's political counselor, Liu Jing, asked management at Canberra's National Press Club last week to drop an invitation to Rebiya Kadeer to speak on Tuesday, the club said. Kadeer is blamed by Beijing for instigating last month's ethnic riots in Xinjiang province, which left 197 people dead, mostly Han Chinese, and wounded more than 1,600. ""Embassies, diplomats, officials are entitled to put views in Australian society, but when they put those views, those views have to be put appropriately,"" Smith said. The Australian newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday that Australia's Mandarin-speaking prime minister, Kevin Rudd, was increasingly irritating Chinese leaders with his conviction that he had a special relationship with Beijing and could therefore be outspoken on Chinese internal affa"

""I think it (the stimulus) has made a difference, the economy has actually bottomed and I think we are facing a positive quarter, and I think that is largely due to the stimulus,"" he said in an interview with Reuters Television in New York. The Obama administration is pumping $787 billion into the economy in a bid to turn around the deepest recession since the 1930s. The U.S. economy shrank by 1 percent in the second quarter after tumbling 6.4 percent in the quarter before that, the biggest decline since 1982. Soros said he did not believe the economy needed more stimulus money, despite calls for a second round of spending. Notably, in July, House of Representatives Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the U.S. should be open to more government spending if needed. Also on Tuesday, U.S. President Barack Obama sounded a cautious note, saying the economy is ""not out of the woods"" despite signs lagging business investment was reviving. Last week the White House said there are no plans for a second stimulus package.

en.15.139.144.2009.8.12,"Putin visits Abkhazia, vows Russian defense","SUKHUMI, Georgia, Aug 12,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin made a surprise visit to the breakaway region of Abkhazia on Wednesday, pledging half a billion dollars to strengthen the defenses of the Moscow-backed rebel enclave. Russia recognized Abkhazia and another breakaway region, South Ossetia, as independent states last year after Russian troops repelled a Georgian attempt to retake South Ossetia in a five day war which ended on August 12, 2008. Tensions have been rising along the de facto borders between the regions and Georgia proper, raising concerns that another conflict could be easily sparked. ""With today's Georgian leadership, you cannot rule anything out,"" Putin said in an interview with Abkhaz reporters when asked if there would be a repeat of last year's war. Putin, who arrived by helicopter in the local capital Sukhumi, said Russia would spend 15-16 billion roubles ($500 million) in 2010 on strengthening Abkhazia's defenses, including shoring up its borders and equipping Russian military bases. ""We will make the necessary efforts together with the corresponding Abkhaz structures to build a modern border defense,"" Putin said in the interview, a copy of which was supplied by his press service to reporters. ""This is an additional and serious guarantee of the security of Abkhazia and South Ossetia,"" he said, adding that Russia would provide an additional 2.5 billion roubles in aid next year to support the Abkhaz budget. The rest of the world -- apart from Nicaragua -- still views Abkhazia and South Ossetia as part of Georgia, though Russia has deployed several thousand troops to the regions and has military bases in both enclaves. RUSSIA-BACKED REGION Putin's visit, during a break from his vacation in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, underscores Russia's strengthening foothold in the rebel regions, whose populations are ethnically distinct from Georgians and look to Moscow for support. The European Union last month criticized a visit by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to South Ossetia and said it supported Georgia's territorial integrity. The United States has called for Georgia's sovereignty to be respected. Both regions broke away from Georgia's rule after wars in the early 1990s and have run their own affairs ever since. They are heavily dependent on Russia. Pro-Russian billboards -- ""Russia and Abkhazia: together for prosperity"" -- dotted the streets of Sukhumi, which is nestled among vineyards and orchards on the Black Sea coast. Putin planned to lay a wreath at a cenotaph in honor of those who fell in a 1992-1993 war. He was also due to visit a maternity hospital. Putin said he had last visited Abkhazia in Soviet times, when the coast was a popular holiday destination, to work as part of a student labor brigade. ""I earned what was in those times an enormous sum -- 800 roubles. With the money, I bought an overcoat which I wore for 15 years,"" Putin s"

Moriarty also said a democratic system had emerged in Bangladesh from a ""free and fair election in December"". Others have made similar statements over the past month as foreign diplomats have come under fire recently, and demands have surfaced to bring the leaders of the 1/11 changeover ""to justice"" for imposing emergency rule and installing a two-year interim regime without constitutional basis. Outgoing German ambassador Frank Meyke on July 26 praised the former caretaker government for its role in restoring democracy in Bangladesh, and also stressed that diplomats in Dhaka played no part in prompting the state of emergency in January 2007. But, he added, ""Once it happened, we supported it."" Prior to that, British high commissioner in Dhaka Stephen Evans on July 15 refuted allegations that the diplomatic community in Bangladesh had a hand in ""calling the army out of barracks"" during the 1/11 changeover. Evans said the state of emergency was imposed at the time as an ""internal dynamic"" in Bangladesh. He also mounted a strong defence of his predecessor Anwar Choudhury who is seen by many as one of the brains behind the changeover. Meanwhile, former British envoy Anwar Choudhury, on a recent trip to Dhaka, denied the allegation of having orchestrated the 1/11 events as some have alleged, the main opposition BNP being among the loudest of Choudhury's detractors. The Bangladesh-born British diplomat's visit to Bangladesh as director in charge of International Organisations of the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, had sparked some protests. ""I categorically deny any involvement in the 1/11 shift in the political scenario,"" said Choudhury in a statement on Aug 5 during his stay. US ambassador Moriarty made his comments on Tuesday at the close of a training session for American and Bangladeshi military personnel from the engineering and medical divisions at Chilamri in Kurigram. Moriarty also said that the US wanted to see the trial of war criminals in Bangladesh prosecuted in a transparent and neutral manner, while maintaining internationally acceptable standards. The trial of individuals accused of war crimes should not be politicised, he said. bdnews2"

Barghouthi was jailed on charges of organizing the killing of Israelis. He denies the charges. Fatah elected a new top executive body with members of the ""Old Guard"" losing their positions, the initial results showed after more than 90 percent of votes had been counted. Abbas has said the party, holding its first congress in 20 years, needed to show disillusioned voters a new beginning. Out of 10 ""Old Guard"" members seeking re-election, less than half succeeded. The congress of the main Palestinian political movement began last Tuesday with about 2,000 delegates attending in the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Most of its proceedings have been held behind closed doors. Abbas, 74, was reaffirmed unopposed as leader in a show of hands that made it impossible to tell if anyone voted against him. However, critics say he is weak and the congress may not strengthen his position. Fatah is ready to negotiate a peace deal with Israel but it is struggling to reverse a decline in popularity. Abbas has no vice-president and no natural successor waiting in the wings. Barghouti, 50, is a popular and articulate figure who was once seen as a successor to Yasser Arafat. A controversial figure who won a post was Mohammed Dahlan, reviled by Hamas supporters over crackdowns he led against the Islamist group when he headed the Fatah-dominated Preventive Security service in the Gaza Strip in the 1"
en.15.139.236.2009.8.10,"Taliban attack near Kabul kills police, civilians","PULE ALAM, Afghanistan, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least three Afghan police and two civilians were killed in a brazen attack by Taliban gunmen and suicide bombers on government buildings near Kabul on Monday, officials said, 10 days before elections. The attack, the latest in a series of assaults before the August 20 presidential election, came after U.S. commanders said the war in Afghanistan had not reached a crisis point even though the Taliban had gained momentum. Deen Mohammad Darwish, a spokesman for the governor of Logar province, about an hour's drive south of the capital, Kabul, said one Taliban attacker was also killed along with the police and civilians. Witnesses said gunbattles lasted several hours. The Taliban last month vowed to disrupt the election, calling on Afghans to boycott the vote. There has been a spate of ambushes on candidates, campaign workers and election officials before and after that warning. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said six fighters wearing vests packed with explosives had attacked the governor's office, police headquarters and election offices in Pule Alam, 70 kms (45 miles) from Kabul. The attack followed a brazen pattern of assaults in the eastern cities of Khost and Gardez last month. Darwish said fighting was continuing as Afghan security forces battled to reclaim the police headquarters and governor's office. A major highway linking Kabul to provinces in the southeast was closed because of the fighting, he said. Abdul Rahim, an aid worker in an office next to the police building, said five police were killed and 26 people wounded. He said at least three of the attackers were dressed in burqas, the head-to-toe covering worn by some Afghan women. Reuters reporters in the city heard at least three loud blasts and sporadic gunfire after Afghan security forces counter-attacked. Thick smoke poured from the police building as U.S. Apache attack helicopters hovered overhead. ""THINGS WILL GET WORSE"" With U.N. officials acknowledging on Sunday that violence and poor security had hampered election preparations in some areas, residents in Pule Alam feared it would deteriorate further. ""Things will only get worse with the election,"" shopkeeper Faizal Ahmad said. ""We will have no security in the future."" President Hamid Karzai is the front-runner to retain power over a field of 35 challengers but poor security in the south, his traditional ethnic Pashtun power base, looms as a potential problem if it results in poor voter turnout, analysts have said. Poor Pashtun turnout could mean no candidate secures more than 50 percent of the vote, requiring a second-round runoff when challengers could form a coalition behind one of Karzai's main rivals, former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah or former finance minister Ashraf Ghani. In an interview published earlier on Monday, U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal said the Taliban had gained momentum recently, advancing out of traditional strongholds in the south and east into the relatively more peaceful north and west. ""It's a very aggressive enemy right now,"" McChrystal told The Wall Street Journal newspaper (online.wsj.com/). ""We've got to stop their momentum, stop their initiative. It's hard work,"" said McChrystal, who will present an assessment of the war to Washington after the August 20 election. Violence across Afghanistan this year had already reached its worst levels since the Taliban were ousted by U.S.-led Afghan forces in 2001 and escalated dramatically after major offensives were launched in southern Helmand province in July. July quickly became the deadliest month of the war for foreign troops, with at least 71 killed. At least 41 U.S. troops were killed, more than the previous monthly high of 26 killed in September 2008. Despite the Taliban gains and growing military casualties -- August is already on track to match or pass the July toll -- U.S. national security adviser Jim Jones said the war had not reached a crisis point. ""I don't think we're at a crisis level where there is any move by the Taliban to overthrow the government,"" Jones told the CBS program ""Face the Nation."""
en.15.139.375.2009.8.13,Obama honours Yunus with Medal of Freedom,"Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  US president Barack Obama awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest US civilian honour, to 16 agents of global change on Wednesday, including Bangladeshi economist and microcredit pioneer Mohammed Yunus, South African anti-apartheid veteran Desmond Tutu and British physicist Stephen Hawking. Nobel laureate Yunus, self-described 'Banker to the Poor', broke new ground with micro-loans to the poor, now replicated worldwide. Yunus, an economist by training, founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in 1983, which has since disbursed over $8 billion. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his work. Handing Yunus the Medal of Freedom, Obama said: ""Thirty-five years ago, a young economics professor at a university in Bangladesh was struck by the disconnect between the theories he was teaching in class and the reality of the famine outside."" ""Mohammed Yunus was just trying to help a village, but he somehow managed to change the world,"" said Obama. At the start of his address, Obama thanked the ""agents of change"" and ""finest citizens"" of his country and other countries. ""The recipients of the Medal of Freedom did not set out to win this or any other award. They did not set out in pursuit of glory or fame or riches. Rather, they set out, guided by passion, committed to hard work, aided by persistence, often with few advantages but the gifts, grace, and good name God gave them,"" the US president said. US's highest civilian honour is awarded for ""especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavours"". Stephen Hawking is an internationally recognised theoretical physicist who has a severe physical disability due to motor neuron disease. Awarding the medal to Hawking, Obama said, """"From his wheelchair, he's led us on a journey to the farthest and strangest reaches of the cosmos. In so doing, he has stirred our imagination and shown us the power of the human spirit here on Earth."" Desmond Tutu, widely regarded as ""South Africa's moral conscience,"" led a formidable crusade in support of justice and racial reconciliation in South Africa. He received a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 1984. Other figures to receive the Medal were Mary Robinson, Ireland's first woman president, who left the presidency early to serve as the United Nations high commissioner for human rights; Sidney Poitier, the first African-American to be nominated for and win a Best Actor Academy Award; and Senator Edward Kennedy, who has served in the US Senate for nearly 50 years, a career dedicated to ""fighting for equal opportunity, fairness and justice for all Americans. Obama's selection of Robinson to receive the medal sparked anger among some pro-Israel lobby groups, who accused her of bias against the Jewish state. But Obama described the former United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights as an ""advocate for the hungry and the hunted."" Poitier, the president said, had not only entertained, but shifted racial attitudes, broadened hearts and brought Americans together. Senator Edward Kennedy, who is battling brain cancer, was missing from the ceremony, and was represented by his daughter Kara. ""The life of Senator Edward M. Kennedy has made a difference for us all,"" Obama said. Harvey Milk, the first openly gay official of a major US city; Pedro Jose Greer, an academic and doctor who works extensively with the poor in Miami, Florida; and the last living Plains Indian war chief, Joseph Medicine Crow, whose books preserve the history and culture of Native Americans were also honoured on Wednesday. Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman justice on the US Supreme Court, US geneticist Janet Davison Rowley, whose studies of chromosome abnormalities in human leukemia and lymphoma have led to dramatically improved survival rates for previously incurable cancers, Nancy Goodman Brinker, who founded the global breast cancer grassroots organisation Susan G Komen for the Cure in memory of her sister, former tennis pro Billie Jean King, who became the first woman commissioner in professional sport after her court career ended; and Latina actress, dancer and singer Chita Rivera rounded out the list of women recipients"

Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, 57, who is dying of prostate cancer, must drop his appeal to be considered for repatriation under a prisoner transfer agreement signed by Britain and Libya. Unconfirmed media reports this week said the Scottish government was planning to release Megrahi on compassionate grounds. ""His condition has taken a significant turn for the worse in recent weeks,"" his lawyer Tony Kelly said in a statement. ""He applied to the High Court of Justiciary to abandon his appeal against conviction."" The court in Edinburgh will meet on Tuesday to consider the request, a spokeswoman said. Megrahi made a separate application to the Scottish authorities in July to be released due to his severe illness, his lawyer said. Megrahi was convicted under Scottish law at a trial in the Netherlands of blowing up a Pan Am Boeing 747 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie as it flew from London to New York. He was sentenced to 27 years in prison. The bomb killed all 259 people on board, including 189 Americans, and 11 people on the ground. The United States government and many of the families of US victims oppose Megrahi's release and believe he should complete his life sentence in a Scottish jail. However, some British relatives of those killed have questioned the case against Megrahi and say the full truth about the Lockerbie bombing has yet to eme"

""This is a chance for me  and for the United States of America  to say thank you to some of the finest citizens of this country and of all countries,"" Obama said at a White House ceremony. In presenting the medal to the Bangladesh Nobel laureate Obama said, ""with his belief in the self-reliance of all people, Professor Muhammad Yunus has altered the face of finance and entrepreneurship. As an academic, he struggled with pervading economic theories and their effects on the people of his native Bangladesh. ""Yearning for a new way of lifting people out of poverty, he revolutionized banking to allow low-income borrowers access to credit. In the process, he has enabled citizens of the world's poorest countries to create profitable businesses, support their families and help build sustainable communities. In so doing, Muhammad Yunus has unleashed new avenues of creativity and inspired millions worldwide to imagine their own potential"". It was Obama's first chance to award the medal, the highest civilian honor, since he was elected president in January. And there were some emotional moments. Among the recipients were Sydney Poitier, the black actor. When the president hugged Poitier, it was a poignant reminder of how the actor, who broke racial barriers, had paved the way for Obama's own journey to the White House. Among the luminaries who got the award were 11 Americans and five foreign nationals including Physicist Stephen Hawkins, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and UN Human Rights Commissioner. There was some controversy over the selection of Robinson who was accused by some Jewish groups for her alleged anti-Israel bias. The White House said Obama had no second thoughts about the award; during the ceremony, the president praised Robinson for her work as ""an advocate for the hungry and the hunted, the forgotten and the ignored."" Two of the awards  to Jack Kemp, the one-time Republican vice-presidential candidate, and Harvey Milk, the slain gay rights activist, were delivered posthumously. The only other recipient who could not make it to the White House ceremony because of his illness was Senator Edward Kennedy. His daughter, Kara, accepted the medal on his behalf. She seemed to blink back tears as she accepted the award on behalf of her. Obama introduced the honorees in alphabetical order, but saved Senator Kennedy for last, praising him as someone who has fought for soldiers, working families and students for nearly half a century, and whose life ""has made a difference for us all."" Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, was also among the honor"
en.15.65.11.2008.5.2,Zimbabwe announces election run-off,"HARARE, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's opposition leader defeated President Robert Mugabe in the presidential election but faces a run-off vote after he failed to win an outright majority, the electoral body said. Movement for Democratic Change leader Morgan Tsvangirai won 47.9 percent of the vote on March 29 and Mugabe took 43.2 percent, said Chief Elections Officer Lovemore Sekeramayi. The result was announced after a verification process by the candidates to check the result, but an opposition MDC spokesman said the announcement was scandalous and described it as ""daylight robbery"". He said the party executive would decide on the next move. Earlier, it had rejected the figure. Its initial projections showed Tsvangirai had won 50.3 percent of the vote and it said it had ended the rule of Mugabe, 84, who has led Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980. A month-long delay to results had raised fears of widespread bloodshed in a country suffering economic ruin. The official figures matched those leaked to Reuters earlier in the week by government officials, in a sign the ground was being prepared for a run-off. By law, a second round should be held within 21 days of a result being announced. Tsvangirai has raised doubts over whether he would take part in a run-off and has been out of the country since shortly after the vote, trying to keep up international pressure on Mugabe. Tsvangirai has suggested he could only contest a second round if it was monitored by United Nations-led foreign observers. The main international observer group during the first round was from Zimbabwe's neighbors. The opposition accuses the ruling ZANU-PF party, which lost its parliamentary majority in a parallel vote on March 29, of a campaign of violence and intimidation ahead of a possible second round and says 20 of its members have been killed. The government denies that and accuses the MDC of political attacks. Zimbabwe's economic collapse, for which Mugabe's critics blame his policies, has sent millions of refugees into neighboring countries to escape severe food, fuel and foreign currency shortages and inflation of 165,000 percent -- the world's highest."

The South American Football Confederation (CSF) said in a statement that the ban would be lifted once the Argentine club had improved protection in front of the VIP boxes, where the incident occurred. The club were also fined $30,000. Referee Jorge Larrionda ended last Wednesday's Libertadores Cup tie against Brazil's Cruzeiro one minute early after linesman Pablo Fandino of Uruguay suffered a cut on his forehead. Boca, who were winning the third-round, first-leg tie 2-1, have promised to find the culprit and have expressed shock that the ice was thrown from the most expensive seats in the stadium. ""The Alberto J.

""The stadium will only be approved once it has been checked by the confederation and only upon the request of the directors for Boca Juniors."" The CSF also confirmed that the result would stand. Cruzeiro had claimed that they should be given a 3-0 win because the game did not finish. The second leg is in Belo Horizonte on Wednesday.

en.15.65.12.2008.5.7,"Russia`s Medvedev takes power, pledges freedom","Moscow, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dmitry Medvedev was sworn in as Russian president in a solemn ceremony in the Kremlin's throne room on Wednesday, beginning an unprecedented period of dual rule with his predecessor Vladimir Putin. Medvedev, a 42-year-old former corporate lawyer and longtime Putin ally, stressed freedom and the rule of law in his first remarks after taking the oath of office and receiving a gold chain of double-headed eagles symbolizing the presidency. ""I believe my most important aims will be to protect civil and economic freedoms,"" he told the 2,000 guests at the inauguration, broadcast live on television. ""We must fight for a true respect of the law and overcome legal nihilism, which seriously hampers modern development."" The new leader, who arrived at the Kremlin alone in an armored black stretch Mercedes limousine flanked by 11 motorcycle outriders, inherits a booming economy fuelled by high oil prices -- but also a sobering set of challenges. They include rampant corruption, rising inflation, a falling population, sickly industry and agriculture and increasingly tense relations with former Soviet neighbors and the West. Putin has also been accused by domestic critics and foreign governments of trampling on human rights and limiting democratic freedoms. Before Medvedev was sworn in, a somber-looking Putin entered the Kremlin alone and thanked the Russian people for their trust and support over his two, four-year terms. Barred by term limits from standing again, he encouraged his audience to support Medvedev but also told them not to deviate from his policies. ""It is very important for everyone to continue the course we have started already and which has proved right,"" he said. Following the inauguration, Patriarch Alexiy II, the head of the powerful Russian Orthodox Church, led a religious service in a nearby cathedral to bless the new president. Putin named Medvedev as his preferred successor last December, ensuring his overwhelming victory in the March polls. The two men have worked together since the early 1990s. But the Kremlin leader will retain major political influence after quitting, both in his expected new role as prime minister and as head of the ruling United Russia party which controls parliament. He remains by far Russia's most popular politician. COMMON VIEWS Putin has said he sees no problem working with Medvedev, with whom he says he shares common views on Russia's future. But their double-headed government has alarmed many Russians, who are accustomed to a single strong leader. They question how the arrangement would work in a crisis and whose word would be final. The inauguration ceremony in the Grand Kremlin Palace broadly followed the pattern set in 2000, when Putin was sworn in, allowing officials to stress continuity and the smooth transition of power. Stirring passages from Russian composers Tchaikovsky and Glinka were meshed with pomp and circumstance for the event, which was designed in the 1990s to evoke the imperial power of Russia's past and bury memories of its drab Soviet period. Around 2,000 politicians, religious leaders, business chiefs, ambassadors and military were invited but access was not granted to foreign media. Attendees received a gold medal with the Kremlin on one side and a double-headed eagle on the other. The constitution, adopted under Boris Yeltsin, gives the president strong powers, including the right to define Russia's foreign and domestic policy, appoint the prime minister and other key ministers and control security and defense agencies. Putin, in his time in office, further boosted Kremlin power by assuming the right to name hitherto elected regional governors and taking control of parliament. The prime minister, by contrast, focuses mainly on economic and social policy. Putin, who has presided over uninterrupted economic growth, has said he will focus on making Russia one of the top seven global economies by 2020. He has promised not to change the constitution to seek extra powers in his new job. Eight years ago, the departing Yeltsin left Putin a pen with which he used to sign laws as a symbol of a handover of power. Putin said in a newspaper interview last month that he would take the historic pen with him rather than leave it to Medvedev."
en.15.65.267.2008.5.3,Shuttle tank delays push back Hubble mission,"Houston, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Delays in producing space shuttle fuel tanks, which were substantially redesigned after the 2003 Columbia disaster, will postpone NASA's final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope by a month or longer, officials at the US space agency said on Thursday. Originally due to launch on August 28, the space shuttle flight to the telescope will be postponed four to five weeks, shuttle program manager John Shannon said. ""We cannot make the August 28 date,"" he said during media briefings at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. To fly to Hubble, NASA decided it needed a second shuttle ready to launch in case the ship carrying the crew became too damaged to return home. Other missions don't require a backup shuttle because stranded astronauts can take shelter in the International Space Station. The orbital outpost will be too far away for the Hubble crew to reach, however. Needing two tanks ready for launch strained the manufacturing process, Shannon said, adding that it took time for the agency's contractors to learn new assembly procedures following the 2003 Columbia accident. NASA suspended tank production and grounded its remaining shuttles to investigate why a piece of insulation foam that fell off Columbia's fuel tank during launch triggered the fatal accident. Investigators determined the debris had hit a heat panel on Columbia's wing, damaging it and allowing superheated gases to flow inside the structure during atmospheric re-entry. NASA redesigned the tank to minimize foam shedding, added inflight inspections, developed repair kits and set up the space station as a safe haven for shuttle crewmembers. Shannon said a lot of care had gone into the preparation of fuel tanks since, and it was not a job NASA wanted its contractors to rush. ""I think it's a small price to pay for all the improvement that we're getting on this tank,"" he added. ""It's a much, much better tank than we were flying pre-Columbia. It just took a little extra time."" NASA plans to fly 11 shuttle missions before the fleet is permanently retired in 2010. All but the Hubble repair mission are devoted to completing the $100 billion space station. The agency's next flight, scheduled for May 31, will deliver the main part of Japan's huge Kibo space laboratory to the station. The tank delays will also force NASA to bump a sixth mission the agency had hoped to fly this year to early 2009."

Apart from the 22 employees, about 10 employees working under the league committee were also asked to quit, another employee alleged. ""It was a misunderstanding,"" Salahuddin told bdnews24.com Friday. ""I have asked those who are not willing to work with the new committee to resign, not all,"" said the BFF president. ""If somebody doesn't want to work with the new committee, he may go,"" said the former football superstar, who was elected president of BFF on Monday. Malu only said: ""I have asked the employees to submit their bio-data with job responsibilities. The president wants to know more about the employees."" bd"

League likely to get underway in September this season. To give shape to the thoughts, the BFF executive committee led by Kazi Salahuddin sits for the first time after being elected on April 28. ""We are considering organising two tournaments of the federation cup in July and a tri-nation club cup meet in August before starting the 2nd B. League in September,"" BFF vice president Badal Roy told reporters after emerging from an unofficial meeting of the new BFF members Tuesday. Roy said that the booters' transfer of B. League might take place on the scheduled May 15 as a tri-party agreement among clubs, federation and players was earlier signed. The former national footballer-turn-organiser said that they were also thinking of reviving the popular tournament of national football championship The previous committee led by SA Sultan failed to hold the Federation Cup last season, and omitted the national football championship and failed to hold any international tournament during its five-year (one year extended by FIFA) stint. Roy said that the meeting would also discuss some matters like forming different standing committees including committees of 7-member emergency, national team, B. League, disciplinary and players' status. The emergency committee, which must consist of the president and vice president, will take decision in crisis moments if the 21-member committee cannot sit while the national team committee will look after all matters related to the national team. The meeting will also revise the yearly calendar, which was designed by the previous committee, to avoid overlapping of different meets, and will discuss the upcoming SAFF Championship in Sri Lanka and the Maldives in June. Roy also hinted that the meeting might take decision to stage Futsal football in a bid to increase player skills."

Nargis hit Myanmar on May 3, killing more than 25,000 people with a further 40,000 still missing. Sidr slammed into the southern Bangladesh on November 15 last year, claiming about 3,500 people. ""While we can never pinpoint one disaster as the result of climate change, there is enough scientific evidence that climate change will lead to intensification of tropical cyclones,"" CSE's director Sunita Narain said in a statement Wednesday. ""Nargis is a sign of things to come. Last year, Bangladesh was devastated by the tropical cyclone Sidr. ""The victims of these cyclones are climate change victims and their plight should remind the rich world that it is doing too little to contain its greenhouse gas emissions,"" Narain added. The 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had clearly observed that cyclones will increase in their intensity as a result of global warming. ""There is observational evidence of an increase of intense tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic since about 1970, correlated with increases of tropical sea surface temperatures,"" the CSE said quoting IPCC. ""The IPCC also notes based on a range of models, it is likely that future tropical cyclones (typhoons and hurricanes) will become more intense, with larger peak wind speeds and more heavy precipitation associated with ongoing increases of tropical sea surface temperatures."" Big polluters responsible for these deaths and devastation, said Mario D'Souza, CSE's climate change researcher, in the statement. ""The voices of the victims of climate change must be heard. Like the tropical cyclone Sidr, which ripped through Bangladesh in 2007, the Nargis has also left thousands dead and homeless."" ""This devastation happened because the rich failed to contain emissions necessary for their growth"", said Mario D'Souza Emissions and lifestyles are now spelling doom for countries such as Myanmar and Bangladeshand the big polluters of the world, such as the US, cannot escape their responsibility and role in the 'dance of death' of tropical cyclones like Nargis, said the CSE. ""The question that the world needs to answer now is, how to make these countries pay for the victims of climate change,"" Narain said. bdn"

The MCC are aiming to clarify the law banning all composite materials used in bats or handles. John Stephenson, head of cricket for the club based at Lord's, will present a paper to MCC members on Wednesday after which a vote will be taken. ""We are concerned at the moment about the balance of the game between bat and ball,"" Stephenson told Mumbai tabloid Mid Day on Tuesday. ""While we do not want to discourage innovation, we want to ensure bat manufacturers make bats made of willow and bat handles of cane, rubber and glue."" The issue of whether batsmen were gaining an advantage came up in 2006 when graphite bats of the kind used by Australia captain Ricky Ponting were withdrawn from international cricket by its manufacturer Kookaburra. ""We thought we had got there last year but Gray-Nicolls came up with a bat handle with composite materials like graphite and titanium,"" added Stephenson. ""So we decided to redefine the handle in terms of rubber, cane and glue. It's the first time that the bat handle will be defined in the laws of cricket. ""We want to shore it up now so that we do not have to retrace our steps. It will also give something back to the bowlers."" The MCC and bat manufacturers have agreed to an amicable phasing out of ""illegal"" bats, Stephenson said"

""Let's get to work,"" Rice said as she sat down with Ehud Barak, who heads the Israeli defense ministry and exerts great influence over the network of checkpoints and roadblocks that Israel argues it needs to prevent suicide bombings. Palestinians view the barriers as collective punishment and Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, who is to join Rice in a three-way meeting with Barak later in the morning, say they blight the Palestinian economy. Speaking before she arrived on Saturday for a two-day visit to the region, Rice said she would assess Israel's steps on the ground to see if they had improved the daily lives of Palestinians, including promised removal of barriers. ""The first thing we are going to do is to review the ones that were supposedly moved,"" Rice said, adding she wanted to discuss with Israeli officials how significant those barriers were to allowing greater movement for the Palestinians. ""Not all roadblocks are created equal,"" Rice said. Rice met Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert after her arrival in Jerusalem on Saturday night and will meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Sunday. Abbas and Olmert, who are due to meet on Monday following Rice's departure, agreed in November to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching an agreement by the end of this year. The peace negotiations have yet to show tangible progress. After Rice's last trip in late March, Israel said it planned to remove 61 barriers in the occupied West Bank. But a U.N. survey subsequently found that only 44 obstacles had been scrapped and that most were of little or no significance. Western pressure is mounting on Olmert to do more to ease travel restrictions and take other steps to shore up Abbas, whose authority has been limited to the West Bank since Hamas Islamists took over the Gaza Strip in June. On Saturday, Abbas's security forces deployed to the northern West Bank city of Jenin for a law-and-order campaign meant to show the government is laying the ground for statehood. Rice also plans to hold trilateral meetings with the top peace negotiators, Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Ahmed Qurei of the Palestinians. U.S. officials are sensitive to the lack of demonstrable progress in the talks and they hope to use a visit by President George W Bush, who will travel to the region this month to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Israel's founding, to nudge them al"
en.15.65.217.2008.5.3,US envoy meets Nepal's Maoist former rebel chief,"Kathmandu, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US ambassador to Nepal has met the country's Maoist former rebel chief, the first official meeting of a senior American official with a group that Washington still labels terrorists. A U.S. embassy statement issued on Friday said Ambassador Nancy Powell met Pushpa Kamal Dahal, known by his nom de guerre Prachanda, on Thursday to discuss the outcome of the April 10 election in which the Maoists emerged as the largest party. The victory of the Maoists, who gave up an armed revolt in 2006 with a peace deal that ended a decade-long civil war, put the United States in a tight spot as it would now have to do business with the party likely to form the new government. The Maoists have abandoned many of their leftist policies, such as nationalisation, to embrace foreign investment and public-private partnerships. Their victory could lead to a focus on improving living conditions in South Asia's poorest country. The statement said the two also discussed the Maoist party's plans for the Constituent Assembly, which will write Nepal's new constitution, and the future of U.S.-Nepal relations. ""The meeting occurred in advance of Powell's return to the United States for consultations on U.S.-Nepal relations,"" it said. ""Powell provided an overview of current U.S. government assistance to Nepal designed to help create a more prosperous, democratic and stable Nepal."" A Maoist politburo member told Reuters the meeting was an indication Washington wanted to mend fences now that they had won the election. ""All the signals are positive that they will remove the terrorist tag on us soon,"" Dinanath Sharma said. ""How can they not recognise the fact that we won a free and fair election?"" Analysts too agree the United States had moved to break the ice with the former rebels. ""It is the beginning of the U.S. recognition of the Maoists as a democratic force,"" said Yubnath Lamsal, the chief editor of the Rising Nepal daily. Powell sought assurances that the new government would respect donor agreements and ensure the safety of those implementing them. The envoy urged the Maoists to show their commitment to the political process through their words and actions. The Maoists say they are committed to the peace process but cannot yet renounce violence completely, a stance that analysts say is more aimed at browbeating political opponents than a real threat."
en.15.65.20.2008.5.4,Night club drug could ease depression: scientists,"LONDON, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Scientists have unraveled how a horse tranquilizer and hallucinogenic night club drug known as ""Special K"" can ease depression, researchers said on Friday. Ketamine, which can also cause feelings of detachment, could pave the way for new treatments for people suffering from depression, the researchers added. Their study, published in the Archives of General Psychiatry, found ketamine restores to normal the orbifrontal cortex, an area of the brain located above the eyes that is overactive in depressed people. The area is believed to be responsible for feelings of guilt, dread, apprehension and physical reactions such as a racing heart, said Bill Deakin, who led the study. ""The study results have given us a completely novel way of treating depression and a new avenue of understanding depression,"" said Deakin, a neuroscientist at the University of Manchester. Depression is a leading cause of suicide and affects about 121 million people worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation. In their study, Deakin and his team gave intravenous ketamine to 33 healthy male volunteers and took minute-by-minute brain scans to see what was happening as the drug took effect. Images from the scans showed that the drug -- also used as a battlefield anesthetic -- worked quickly, Deakin said. The results were surprising because the researchers had expected that the ketamine would instead affect the part of the brain that controls psychosis, he added. ""There was some activity there but more striking was the switching off of the depression centre,"" Deakin said. Previous research had shown that ketamine improved symptoms in depressed people after just 24 hours -- far faster than the month it can take for Prozac to kick in -- but until now they did not know exactly how. The latest findings give researchers a specific target to design new drugs and offer hope for the many people who do not respond to Prozac or other standard medicines, Deakin added. Prozac was initially introduced by U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co in 1987 and belongs to a class of compounds called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It is now off patent and widely available generically as fluoxetine. ""Many people don't respond to treatment,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""This offers a potential way of treating them."""

Gold rose to $861.10/864.10 an ounce from $855.80/857.00 an ounce late in New York on Friday, when it tumbled to $845 an ounce, its lowest since Jan 2, after the dollar jumped on better-than-expected US jobs data. It has lost more than 16 percent in value since spiking to a record high of $1,030.80 an ounce on March 17. Tokyo precious metal futures markets are closed on Monday and Tuesday for public holidays. ""I think given that we have a relatively strong rally in oil, we're certainly finding some good support,"" said Darren Heathcote of Investec Australia in Sydney. ""I think the current resistance will be around $868. I guess that recent lows around $845 are probably going to support,"" said Heathcote, adding that gold was consolidating after the recent drop. Oil barely moved around $116 a barrel on Monday, pausing after jumping more than 3 percent last week on further supply disruptions in Nigeria and tensions between Iran and the West. The euro inched up to 1.5432 but was well off April's record highs around $1.6018. The dollar firmed on Friday after US payrolls fell by a surprisingly small 20,000 in April, while the jobless rate actually dipped to 5.0 percent.

en.15.65.162.2008.5.4,"Wall St cuts perks with writedowns, layoffs","NEW YORK, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - For many bankers and traders, the days of company perks such as sleek limos, cushy business class seats, and fat steaks are gone. Multibillion dollar write-downs have forced trading desk heads and senior bankers to chip away at small comforts to reduce expenses and strengthen the bottom line. Just ask Ron Karp, a controller at Corporate Transportation Group, which provides rides home to Wall Streeters working late. ""The phone doesn't ring as much as it used to. If you're firing people you're not going to send them around in limos,"" Karp said. The slowdown has been visible over the past month at car services city-wide, he added. Cutbacks are happening in individual departments, rather than companywide as seen early this decade after the tech bubble burst. But affected employees feel the pinch anyway. Credit Suisse has reduced some cell phone subsidies and done away with car vouchers. Merrill Lynch has banned business class travel for some divisions, Goldman Sachs has pulled free soda, and JP Morgan has upped the requirements for free meals and car rides. Slashing small perks cuts costs, but more importantly it signals that workers should keep expenses down in areas under their control. ""Banks cut perks to reinforce to employees that the firm's under pressure,"" Brad Hintz, an equity analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said. ""It tells people to use their heads and watch expenses."" A HARSH CLIMATE Financial institutions have announced more than $300 billion of write-downs, losses and credit provisions since mid-2007. That has spurred big layoffs, including over 23,000 announced in April, with about half the cuts coming out of Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, according to a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. ""The usual pattern is to accelerate layoffs and cut operating costs as much as they can,"" said Roy Smith, a professor of entrepreneurship and finance at the Stern School of Business and a former partner at Goldman Sachs. Banks followed this protocol in 1987, 1990-91, 1994, 1998 and 2000-2002, he said. The question remains whether the cuts will end as the outlook for Wall Street firms improves, with the AMEX Security Broker Dealer Index .XBD rising over 30 percent to 181 since its March 17 lows. TIGHTENING THE BELT Managers forced to make a choice prefer to cut comforts rather than personnel so that they are equipped to take advantage of any rebound in the markets. Hence, at Credit Suisse, some divisions have placed a strict $30 limit on meals ordered by traders working late, according to a person familiar with the matter. Employees can no longer choose dinner from any restaurant in town. Instead, all catering goes through online service SeamlessWeb, so that managers can better monitor food orders. Gone are some employees' free personal cell phone bills: the firm now only subsidizes a portion. Car vouchers are history: traders must pay for rides with corporate cards. Some divisions at Merrill Lynch, which recently posted its third straight quarterly loss, have pushed employees to the back of the airplane: they've eliminated first class and business class travel for all domestic flights, according to one equity trader familiar with the matter. Spokespersons for Credit Suisse and Merrill said the changes were not implemented across each company, but by individual teams or divisions. Even firms relatively unscathed by the credit crunch are slashing expenses. At JPMorgan, which acquired Bear Stearns for a fire sale price in March, one bond trader said some employees must work later to be eligible for a car ride home, while others must stay at work for a specified time after ordering food on the company account. A JPMorgan spokesperson declined to comment on the issue. Free soda stopped flowing on certain Goldman Sachs trading floors a few weeks ago, a company spokesperson said. Cost cuts can go too far though, and companies may end up paying in other ways, said Jeff Visithpanich, a principal at compensation consultant Johnson Associates. ""Maybe it looks good on paper, but what you get is a number of people taking longer breaks to go downstairs to Starbucks."
en.15.65.192.2008.5.7,India gold festival sales see moderate start,"MUMBAI, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's gold demand was moderate on Wednesday with higher prices on the back of a global rise and a locally weaker rupee damping early sales on Akshaya Tritiya day, dealers said. ""There is not much buying in the wholesale segment, but the retail side is good,"" said a dealer in a large private bank in Mumbai. Gold prices crept up overseas and hovered near the previous day's one-week high, finding support from crude oil that stayed near a record high level. But gains were capped as the dollar remained strong in the overseas markets after a US Federal Reserve official said interest rates needed to be raised. Gold generally moves in tandem with crude oil as the latter signals inflation, while the metal hedges against it. But gold has an inverse relation with the dollar as the two compete for investments. In the local market, the rupee weakened past 41 per dollar for the first time since August and that firmed up gold, as most of the commodity is imported and paid for in the US currency. ""The weaker rupee is discouraging buyers (in the wholesale segment) big time,"" said another dealer in a private bank. In Tamil Nadu, where Akshaya Tritiya is most popular, buyers had started visiting jewellery shops, a Chennai retailer said. ""The auspicious time starts at 1.30 p.m.... we will know later how the sales have been this Akshaya Tritiya,"" said Princeson Jose of Prince Jewellery from Chennai.

The incident in Markham Square, just off King's Road, began at the start of the evening rush hour and forced the closure of a section of Chelsea's popular shopping street. Police said the lone gunman had died. They would not say if the injury occurred during three exchanges of fire in an incident lasting five hours or if he had shot himself. Police had earlier brought in a negotiator to try to talk the gunman out. No hostages were involved. It is not known what sparked the incident although police ruled out robbery and burglary as a motive. Witnesses reported seeing the man carrying a shotgun and they said he had fired more than half a dozen shots. A bus driver told Reuters about eight police cars suddenly appeared as he was traveling down King's Road. He stopped the bus immediately. ""Passengers ran for their lives,"" he said. ""I felt terrified. I immediately thought there was somebody with a gun."" Residents in nearby houses were told to lock their doors and stay away from windows. Fatalities involving the use of firearms by police must be investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

""The poor performance means we have to make changes,"" sporting director Txiki Begiristain told Barca TV. ""Now is the time to analyse the situation and we will make the decisions at the end of the season."" Barca's 1-0 aggregate defeat at the hands of Manchester United in the semi-finals of the Champions League this week meant that the Catalans have now gone two seasons without winning a trophy despite making heavy investment in new players. Begiristain said that there would have been changes even if they had won the tie against the Premier League side. ""If we had got to Moscow almost nothing would have changed,"" he said. ""We haven't improvised before and we aren't going to do it now. Everything has been prepared and will be done in time. The changes will take place at the end of the season."" The former player admitted that the signings the club had made last season, which included France striker Thierry Henry, defenders Eric Abidal and Gabriel Milito, and midfielder Yaya Toure, had failed to bring about the desired improvement. ""Last year, we reacted quickly and at the start of the season no one doubted the quality of the squad, but the truth is it hasn't turned out well. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT ""Not winning any trophies has been a big disappointment given the big names we've got, but the image on the poster is one thing and the performance the players actually give is another."" But he added that the players alone were not the only ones responsible for the club's failures. ""The blame lies with the players, the coaches and the technical staff,"" he said. Barca's former talisman Ronaldinho, the player who was given the credit for steering the club to back-to-back league titles and victory in the Champions League in 2006, tops the list of likely discards at the end of the season. Henry, Portugal midfielder Deco, defenders Lilian Thuram and Gianluca Zambrotta, centre-back Rafael Marquez and forward Eidur Gudjohnsen are amongst the other players Barca are reported to want to offload. Sevilla wingback Daniel Alves, Deportivo Coruna defender Fabricio Coloccini, Bayern Munich fullback Philipp Lahm, Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas and Olympique Lyon striker Karim Benzema have all been touted as possible new recruits. Local media are also taking it for granted that coach Frank Rijkaard will leave the Nou Camp at the end of the season with former player Pep Guardiola, now coach of the club's reserve team, and Jose Mourinho tipped as his possible replacements. ""Rijkaard has done an extraordinary job. He's honest and he is a club man,"" Begiristain said.

Nepal, not a major producer of foodstuffs, mostly exports wheat flour to China and basmati rice to Bangladesh. Nepal's ministry of supplies said the decision to ban exports of rice, paddy and wheat was taken to maintain stocks after India, the main supplier of rice to the Himalayan country, banned export of the non-basmati variety. ""The ban is to rein in price hikes and avoid any food crisis,"" Gyan Darshan Udhas, a supplies ministry official, said. Nepal, which harvested some 4.3 million tonnes of rice in 2007, saw the price of the staple go up by almost 30 per cent in the past three months, primarily because of the rising prices in international markets, Nepal's central bank said. India's ban on rice exports too had directly affected basic foodstuff prices in Nepal. The United Nations World Food Programme warns that about 3.8 million people in Nepal would face food insecurity because of a sharp increase in food prices and political instability in the country's southern plains, the country's industrial heart bordering India. ""There is no stock building by consumers yet, but the situation can turn bad if prices keep rising,"" said Pabitra Bajracharya, chief of Nepal's retailers association"

The torch's five-continent journey was dogged by demonstrations, mostly over China's crackdown against protests in Tibet, which deeply embarrassed Beijing and provoked retaliatory rallies at home and abroad by patriotic Chinese. Security has been tightened in mainland China, where the ruling Communist Party brooks no opposition, so the main threat after the torch leaves Macau for a run through every Chinese province is likely to be the weather. Beijing lambasted the Dalai Lama, whom it blames for inciting the Tibet protests, as a criminal on Saturday as representatives of the exiled Buddhist leader prepared for talks with Chinese officials about the most serious unrest in Tibet for nearly two decades. Hundreds of patriotic torch supporters gathered in Macau at Fisherman's Wharf, waving China flags and shouting ""Go Beijing Go"" as the flame began its latest leg. Some students from the University of Macau staged a small protest near the ferry terminal, brandishing ""Anti-CNN"" placards to slam the broadcaster's perceived bias in its coverage of the Tibetan riots and crackdown by authorities. ""We want everyone to know that China is developing, that China is advancing. We don't want the media to twist their reports on China,"" said Johnson Zhang, one of the students. Macau is home to a booming casino industry which is fuelled in large part by money from across the border in China. Casino magnate Stanley Ho, 86 and an avid swimmer, was the oldest torchbearer and he said his 200 meters was too short. ""I play tennis and dance every now and then,"" Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying. ""Thus running such a short distance was a small case for me."" People in the tropical resort city of Sanya, on the southern tip of Hainan island and the first place the torch will reach in China proper, were gearing up to greet the relay on Sunday. ""As a Chinese, I feel very proud,"" said Sanya resident Gao Li, his eyes moist, after unveiling a large red banner reading ""2008 Go China"" on the beach front, where the torch will pass on its long journey to August's Beijing Games. Security was low key, though organizers are carefully controlling who will be allowed in to see the torch run start, on a man-made island just off Sanya, limiting places to a few hundred selected officials, media and other guests. Meteorologists expect showers in the coming days across much of Hainan and relay organizers have prepared raincoats for the torch runners, a Website of state news agency Xinhua said. EVEREST SETBACK A bold plan to take a separate Olympic torch to the top of Mount Everest faced a possible setback on Saturday as snow fell on the world's highest mountain. The climbing team has been at 6,500 meters (21,300 ft) in advanced base camp or higher for at least two days, waiting for better weather to aim for the 8,848-metre (29,030-foot) peak. ""In my experience, in heavy snow you could make a decision to retreat or abandon, but I don't know the conditions up the mountain so it's difficult to say,"" said Beijing organizing committee consultant Liu Jian. Flag-waving crowds cheered on Friday as the torch made its way across Hong Kong unmolested. A handful of demonstrations called for better protection of human rights, religious freedom and democracy in China along the route. The former British colony took an uncharacteristically tough line against would-be torch protesters, barring several people from abroad from entering the city. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Macau, for centuries a Portuguese-run enclave of China, returned to Chinese control two years later. Both now have wide-ranging autonomy."
en.15.65.147.2008.5.6,Oil pauses near record,"Singapore, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil steadied on Tuesday after surging more than $4 to a record over $120 a barrel in the previous session, on a softer US dollar and supply concerns in Iran and Nigeria. US light crude for June delivery rose 19 cents to $120.16 a barrel by 10:32 pm EDT, after rising to a peak of $120.36 a day ago. London Brent crude was up 20 cents at $118.19 a barrel, after touching a record $118.58 on Monday. ""A lot of this is supply-driven, with the market very vulnerable to any disruption in supplies,"" said Mark Pervan, a senior commodities analyst at the Australian & New Zealand Bank. ""We're seeing large oil-producing countries coming up as a question mark,"" he said. Geopolitical uncertainties in Iran lent support after the world's No.4 oil producer said on Monday it would not consider any incentive offered by world powers that would constrain its right to nuclear technology. Iran's nuclear issue added to growing violence in Nigeria, the world's eighth-largest oil exporter, where Royal Dutch Shell had to shut more of its production after a militant attack on Saturday in the oil-rich Niger Delta. Renewed clashes between Turkey and Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq last week also helped lift oil prices. US President George W Bush, who has called upon oil cartel OPEC to increase output to help bring down prices, is expected to talk with officials from Saudi Arabia about the effects of high fuel prices on the US economy on his trip to the world's top exporter later this month. The US dollar, whose softening in the past months has been driving speculative investments in dollar-denominated crude and other commodities, slipped further on Tuesday on continued doubts about the health of the US economy despite upside surprises from recent economic indicators. ""There's a very large short position sitting on oil, and these short positions are being rebuilt at the moment,"" ANZ Bank's Pervan said. US payrolls fell by 20,000 jobs in March, a quarter of the losses expected, government data showed on Friday, while a Monday report from the Institute for Supply Management showed the US service sector grew unexpectedly in April. Later in the week on Wednesday, traders will eye the weekly US government report on inventories, which is expected to show a 1.8 million-barrel build in crude stocks, a 1.1 million-barrel rise in distillate inventories and a 100,000-barrel fall in gasoline stocks"
en.15.65.416.2008.5.7,China's Hu tells Dalai Lama to show `sincerity',"TOKYO, Wed May 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese President Hu Jintao on Wednesday urged the Dalai Lama and his supporters to show `sincerity' and blamed them for unrest across Tibet and trying to wreck the Beijing Olympics. Hu, speaking after a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, said that China's recent talks with representatives of Tibet's exiled Buddhist leader, the Dalai Lama, had been ""conscientious and serious"" and that the two sides had agreed to continue contacts. But Hu also blamed the Dalai's supporters for recent unrest across Tibet, saying they were trying to wreck Beijing's showcase Olympic Games in August. ""We hope that the Dalai's side will use its actions to show its sincerity,"" Hu told a press conference in Tokyo, urging the Dalai Lama's side to stop the trouble-making and efforts to split Tibet from China. The Dalai Lama has said he wants autonomy, not full independence, for Tibet, supports the Beijing Games and rejects violence. China says he is not sincere. ""We hope that the Dalai's side will use actions to show its sincerity, and truly stop activities to split the motherland, stop planning and instigating violent activities, and stop activities to wreck the Beijing Olympic Games, creating conditions for the next discussions,"" Hu said. ""We hope that the contacts will achieve positive results."" Earlier on Wednesday, a Chinese state newspaper said the Dalai Lama was trying to blacken its name by internationalizing the Tibet problem. Japan's Fukuda told the same news conference he appreciated China's decision to hold talks with Tibet, and called for the dialogue to continue. ""I rate highly the president's decision to have a dialogue and the fact that talks were held,"" Fukuda said. ""I have high expectations that the dialogue will be held patiently and through that, for the situation to improve and the international community's concerns to be dispelled,"" he added. Last month Fukuda told China's visiting foreign minister Yang Jiechi that he must face the fact that Tibet had become an international problem, contradicting the oft-stated Chinese view that it is a domestic dispute"
en.15.65.102.2008.5.6,Demand slows ahead of gold-buying festival,"MUMBAI, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's gold demand slowed down on Tuesday ahead of the Akshaya Tritiya festival as prices hardened, denting the appetite of buyers, dealers said. ""Demand is non-existent... possibly because of the higher levels,"" said one dealer in a large private bank in Mumbai. Gold drew overseas investors to its anti-inflationary appeal, inching up in tandem with crude oil that hovered near a record high on supply concerns. A weaker dollar also pushed gold as it generally has as inverse relationship with the metal with the two competing for investors' wealth. In the local market, hopes for a break below 11,000 rupees per 10 grams faded, making traders buy small amounts in preparation for the gold-buying festival in the next two days. An upmarket jeweller, Tanishq -- a division of Titan Industries Ltd -- expected sales to be the same as last year or even higher, based on advance orders before Akshaya Tritiya. ""Demand may be as good as last year, if not better,"" said V. Govind Raj, vice president -- retail and marketing of Tanishq in Bangalore. Akshaya Tritiya, that would end on Thursday, would mark the last phase of the gold-buying season and demand is expected to taper off by the end of May. After that, festivals in September, would usher in the second busy season for precious metals this year"
en.15.65.271.2008.5.4,"China slams Dalai Lama, to talk to his envoys","SHENZHEN, China, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China kept up a barrage of criticism against the Dalai Lama on Sunday, even as envoys of Tibet's exiled spiritual leader went into fence-mending talks with officials, the first since unrest in the mountain region. The eruption of Tibetan riots in March and China's immediate crackdown have prompted anti-China protests that disrupted the international leg of the Olympic torch relay and led to calls for Western leaders to boycott August's Beijing Games. State news agency Xinhua said Chinese government officials would meet the Dalai Lama's envoys on Sunday. It did not reveal the venue, but the Tibetan government-in-exile said the talks would be in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong. Security was tight outside the state guest house where the talks were expected to be held. Xinhua identified the Chinese negotiators as Zhu Weiqun and Sitar, both of whom are vice-ministers of the Communist Party's united front work and responsible for winning over religious leaders and ethnic minorities. Lodi Gyari and Kelsang Gyaltsen, the Dalai Lama's representatives in Washington and Switzerland respectively, arrived in China on Saturday. A commentary in the Tibet Daily, mouthpiece of the Tibet regional government, accused the Dalai Lama of being a ""loyal tool of international anti-Chinese forces"". It said the Dalai Lama was ""colluding with international anti-Chinese forces to spread rumors and slander to disrupt and sabotage the Olympic torch relay"". They ""performed utterly shameless anti-China chorus after chorus"", the commentary said, adding that the Dalai Lama is the leader of a political group plotting to split Tibet from China. EXPECTATIONS LOW Some analysts said the condemnation suggested China was in no mood to compromise following riots in Tibet which have stoked Western criticism of its rule there. The Dalai Lama, winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, has said he objects to violence and supports the Beijing Olympics. China says he is insincere. China ""hoped ... the Dalai side will take credible moves to stop activities aimed at splitting China"", stop plotting and inciting violence and stop disrupting and sabotaging the Beijing Olympic Games so as to create conditions for talks"", Xinhua said, quoting an unnamed official. But Chhime Chhoekyapa, a senior aide to the Dalai Lama, said the exiled government ""can't have great expectations"" from the talks. There have been six rounds of dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama's envoys since 2002, with no breakthrough. China proposed the talks last month after Western governments urged it to open new dialogue with the Dalai Lama, who says he wants a high level of autonomy, not independence, for the predominantly Buddhist Himalayan homeland he fled in 1959. China says the rioting in Tibet's capital, Lhasa, in March killed 18 ""innocent civilians"" and a police officer. It has not specified how many, if any, protesters have died but says troops used maximum restraint and avoided using lethal weapons. Exiled groups say many more Tibetans have died in the crackdown. The Tibetan government-in-exile estimated this week 203 Tibetans might have died in the unrest since March 10."
en.15.65.304.2008.5.1,"Fed lowers rates, hints cuts may be at end","Washington,May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a modest quarter percentage point on Wednesday, as expected, and hinted the move could be the last in a series meant to buffer the economy from a credit crunch and housing downturn. The Fed, however, kept its options open and nodded to ongoing financial market stress, tight credit and the deepening housing contraction, leaving some market participants guessing rates could still move lower. The central bank's action takes the bellwether federal funds rate target, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 2 percent -- the lowest since December 2004. It was the seventh cut in a campaign that has brought the key lending rate down by 3.25 percentage points since mid-September. The Fed also on Wednesday cut the discount rate it charges on direct loans to banks by a matching quarter point. ""The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity,"" the central bank said. Two officials -- Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher and Philadelphia Fed chief Charles Plosser -- dissented from the decision, preferring to hold rates steady. In addition to citing the ""substantial"" rate reductions now in place, the Fed took note of rising prices for energy and other commodities and dropped a phrase contained in its last announcement that ""downside risks to growth remain."" It also shifted away from a promise to ""act in a timely manner"" to a softer commitment to ""act as needed."" WATCHING AND WAITING Taken together, analysts said the changes suggested policy-makers were now willing to sit back to see if the economy, which some think may be in recession, picks up speed. The Fed is ""basically telling you that unless their outlook for the real economy deteriorates further, they will stay at 2 percent,"" Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief executive officer of Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO), told Reuters. On Wall Street, US stock indexes closed slightly lower, while prices for government bonds rose. The dollar weakened against the euro, but traded flat against the yen. A Reuters poll of 19 top bond firms that deal directly with the Fed in the markets found them split on the question of whether the Fed had now done enough to support the economy. Ten of the so-called primary dealers said the Fed was not done yet, with eight saying it was. One of the dealers surveyed did not offer an opinion. The median forecast, however, pointed to a further quarter-point cut in the fed funds rate by year-end. President George W Bush on Tuesday said the US economy faced a ""tough time,"" a point underscored on Wednesday by a report that showed U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a slim 0.6 percent annual rate in the first quarter. While the modest rate of growth was slightly stronger than economists had expected, it reflected a buildup in inventories that may weigh on the economy in the coming months. Other details in the report were decidedly weak. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of U.S. output, grew at the slowest pace since 2001, business investment fell and home building continued to nosedive, recording the biggest drop in 26 years. At the same time, with US gasoline prices heading toward $4 a gallon and strong global demand pushing up food prices, some Fed officials have worried openly that a desire to bolster the economy could divert the central bank's attention from inflation pressures. LOOKING FOR INFLATION TO MODERATE The Fed said there was some evidence core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, was easing and it still believed inflation would moderate over time. But it also said uncertainty about the inflation outlook remained high, noting the rise in energy and other commodity prices and some signs inflation expectations had moved up. ""This statement strongly implies that the Fed will be on pause for some time,"" said Joseph Brusuelas, US chief economist at research firm IDEAglobal in New York. ""The risks to the upside vis-a-vis inflation are serious enough to be on hold until the lagged impact of past Fed monetary policy and the fiscal stimulus on its way take hold,"" he said. As part of an economic stimulus plan, tax rebates began flowing to US households this week. Even though the Fed dropped language about downside risks to growth, it said economic activity was weak, with business spending subdued and labor markets softenin"
en.15.65.286.2008.5.5,Mogadishu rocked by food demonstrations,"Mogadishu, Mon May 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Somalis protested in Mogadishu's streets on Monday, angry at food traders refusing to take old currency notes that have been blamed for spiraling inflation, witnesses said. ""The whole city is up in smoke,"" protestor Hussein Abdikadir told Reuters while rolling a tire he said he was planning to burn in the Buulahubey neighborhood of southern Mogadishu. ""Traders have refused to take old notes. Food prices are high and we have nothing to eat. We will protest until the traders agree to take the notes and sell us food,"" he said. The Somali shilling is valued at roughly 34,000 to the dollar -- more than double what is was a year ago -- and many blame counterfeiters who mint the notes for the fall in value. That has been doubly compounded by sharply rising world food prices, leaving many in the lawless Horn of Africa nation of 10 million short of money to buy food, prompting several protests or riots in the past six months"
en.15.65.406.2008.5.6,Austrian incest father planned dungeon for years,"Vienna, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Austrian man who held his daughter captive for 24 years and fathered seven children with her had planned the construction of her basement prison years in advance, police said on Monday. Elisabeth Fritzl, 42, was kept prisoner in a windowless dungeon under the family home, whose original part was built in the late 19th century while an extension was finished in 1983. ""Already in the planning phase there was an intention to add something within this regular building -- something unknown, something out of sight of the construction authority, a small area, a little secret, a little dungeon,"" said the head of the police investigation, Franz Polzer, at a news conference. Josef Fritzl, 73, in a case that has generated headlines around the world, has admitted keeping Elisabeth in a cellar for 24 years. Three of her children had spent their entire lives underground with her until the case was uncovered just over a week ago. Elisabeth, who says her father abused her from when she was 11 years old, says she was drugged by him and locked up in the basement when she was 18. When her father submitted the plans for the extension of the family home to authorities some 30 years ago, she was around 12 years old. A total of eight doors fitted with locks secured the entrance to the basement prison, police said. Prosecutors are investigating Fritzl for rape, incest, coercion and the death of one of the children, a baby whose remains he burned in a furnace. INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP The case unfolded just over a week ago, when the eldest child of the incestuous relationship, a 19-year old daughter, became seriously ill and was taken to hospital. The young woman remains in an artificial coma and needs artificial respiration, said her doctor Albert Reiter on Monday. ""Her condition has somewhat improved and stabilized over the past few days,"" Reiter told the news conference. ""But I cannot give a prognosis on how long she will remain in which condition."" Doctors said that the condition of Elisabeth and her children -- two sons aged 18 and 5 were imprisoned with her -- had improved. ""The light, the fresh air and the balanced nutrition are doing them well,"" said Doctor Berthold Kepplinger from the hospital in Amstetten where the family is being treated. He added that Fritzl, upon the request of his daughter, had provided his prisoners with vitamin D supplements and a UV lamp in an attempt to make up for the missing daylight. Fritzl raised the other three children with his wife, Rosemarie, in the house above ground. To explain the sudden appearance of the children, he told authorities that his daughter had run away to join a sect, returning only to leave the three children on the doorstep of the family home in Amstetten. He burnt the remains of a seventh child who died shortly after birth in the house's furnace. ""The siblings in the house and those in the basement are getting to know each other in a playful way now,"" said Kepplinger. ""The nice thing is that they have started having a little day-to-day life together: the mother and the grandmother are making breakfast, the children are making their beds."

The Durham paceman was dropped after England lost the first test in New Zealand in March and in his absence the team won two matches in a row to take the series 2-1. ""The prospect of playing for England is what drives me and if I felt my chance of doing that was gone the probability is I'd retire from first-class cricket altogether,"" Harmison told the Mail on Sunday newspaper. ""This is not an ultimatum or me trying to impose conditions on anyone. But I am 29 now and if I felt my England career was over I would be tempted to say I want to do something different with my life."" Although Harmison retired from one-day internationals in 2006, he is desperate to add to his haul of 212 test wickets. ""I am absolutely determined to show I have something to offer England,"" he said. ""I certainly do not believe I am finished. ""After a terrible year for me on the field with injuries, operations and so little cricket it is ridiculous, my aim is to bowl fast, take wickets and give the selectors something to think about.""

en.15.65.198.2008.5.3,China orders nationwide fight against fatal virus,"Shanghai, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China ordered authorities across the nation on Saturday to fight hand, foot and mouth disease, after the death of an 18-month-old boy suggested a virus causing the illness had spread from eastern provinces to the south. The boy died in the southern province of Guangdong from a suspected case of the disease that was apparently caused by the enterovirus 71, or EV71, the official Xinhua news agency quoted health authorities there as saying. Twenty-two children have died from hand, foot and mouth disease and over 3,000 people have been infected in Fuyang city, in the eastern province of Anhui, since a mass outbreak of the EV71 intestinal virus began spreading there in early March. ""Local Communist Party and government officials are on high alert. Health authorities are urgently taking measures to prevent the disease and treat seriously ill children,"" the Health Ministry said in a statement. It said special equipment was being installed in children's wards of hospitals to treat patients. Local authorities were strengthening the supervision of food safety and water quality in an effort to stop the disease from spreading. Of the 3,321 people infected, 978 were in hospital and 58 were critically ill or in serious condition, the ministry said. It ordered health authorities across the country to step up monitoring for cases of hand, foot and mouth disease, requiring all cases to be reported within 24 hours. Officials were told to go to nurseries and primary schools to educate staff there on hygiene and prevention methods. The ministry said Chinese scientists would step up research into the disease. REPORTING DELAY The virus began spreading in Anhui in early March, but a delay in reporting it to the public until last weekend triggered heated discussion and criticism in the Chinese media, which said local government officials should be sacked. An initial cover-up of the SARS epidemic in 2003 led to the sacking of Beijing's mayor and the health minister. But health officials say there was no cover-up and the reason for the delay in this case was because medical teams were trying to work out what the illness was. Xinhua did not say whether authorities believed EV71 had spread from Anhui to Guangdong, but official Chinese media reported earlier that the virus had spread from Anhui to the neighboring province of Henan. Hand, foot, and mouth disease, characterized by fever, sores in the mouth and a rash with blisters, is a common illness among infants and children and is usually not fatal, according to the National Center for Infectious Diseases in the United States. But the fatal cases in Fuyang involved complications due to infection by EV71, the World Health Organization said on its Website (www.who.int). The number of hospitalized cases in Fuyang has risen sharply since April 19, and public health experts think cases will keeping rising before peaking around June or July, the WHO said. There is no vaccine or antiviral agent available to treat or prevent EV71. Enteroviruses spread mostly through contact with infected blisters or feces and can cause high fever, paralysis and swelling of the brain. (Editing by John Chalmers)"

The ranks of traders and specialists have been thinned by automation in recent years, and NYSE Euronext last year closed down two of its four trading rooms. A fifth room was closed the year before. ""As we roll out more technology and we change some of the rules, it is easier for more of the risk management of the specialist books to be done remotely, so I think they would need fewer people on the floor."" Niederauer said at the Reuters Exchanges and Trading Summit in New York. ""I wouldn't stand in the way of that, and I could see us just in the main room eventually,"" he said. The trading floor has about 650 license-holders, as well as a couple of hundred non-licenseholders, such as clerical staff, he said. ""Could that go down by another 15 or 20 percent? Sure,"" he said. ""Is it going to zero? Not anytime soon. Probably never."" ""I don't plan to close the trading floor. It is not even on my very long list of things to do. I think it's an important part of our brand and our value proposition."" Niederauer said in periods of market turmoil, such as occurred in January this year and August last year, having experts on hand was a key differentiator. ""When you get into volatile periods, people want to use the floor more, they want to get experts involved, they want human judgment,"" he said. When American Stock Exchange staffers move in, they will move into two rooms, a small equity trading floor and a small options floor, Niederauer said. NYSE Euronext agreed to acquire Amex for $260 million in stock earlier this year. Niederauer said roughly 75 percent of American Stock Exchange staffers will likely lose their jobs in the years after the takeover is completed. ""Even though the deal has not closed yet we have been allowed to indicate to people now if there will a job for them at the NYSE after the merger,"" Niederauer said. ""We've asked people outside that 25 percent (that will be retained) to stay with us during that transitional period,"" he said. Generally, staffing cuts will be across the board rather than focusing on a few particular areas or job levels, he added"

After a presidium meeting at AL acting president Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home, acing general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said the party formed a three-member committee to find if there was any conspiracy behind the re-demarcation plan. The committee will submit its report in two weeks. ""The Awami League is not against the delimitation of the election constituencies. But the way the commission has planned to do it will hamper the election roadmap,"" the AL leader said. ""The Election Commission is already three months behind schedule to implement the roadmap. Re-demarcation may further delay the election."" EC's move created doubt among people, he said. The EC had earlier proposed to demarcate 50 constituencies, but is now saying it will redraw the borders of 133, Ashraful said. The AL will seek permission from the government Saturday to hold a symbolic hunger strike on May 5 to drum up support for demand for the release of detained party chief Sheikh Hasina.

en.15.65.459.2008.5.4,Over 200 dead in Myanmar cyclone,"Yangon, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 200 people have been killed in military-ruled Myanmar by a Category 3 cyclone that ripped through Yangon and the Irrawaddy delta, where it flattened two towns, officials and state media said on Sunday. Packing winds of 190 km (120 miles) per hour when it hit on Saturday morning, Cyclone Nargis devastated the former Burma's leafy main city, littering the streets with overturned cars, fallen trees and debris from battered buildings. ""Utter war zone,"" one Yangon-based diplomat said in an email to Reuters in Bangkok. ""Trees across all streets. Utility poles down. Hospitals devastated. Clean water scarce."" A government official in Naypyidaw, the ruling general's new capital 240 miles to the north, said the latest death toll was more than 200. The BBC, citing a report on state television, said 243 people were dead and more than 20,000 homes were destroyed. State MRTV later said the death toll was 241, including 19 in Yangon and 222 killed in the hardest-hit Irrawaddy division southwest of the former capital. Official newspapers in Yangon said only one in four buildings were left standing in Laputta and Kyaik Lat, two towns deep in the rice-producing delta and accessible mainly by boat. There were no details of casualties. In Yangon, many roofs were ripped off even sturdy buildings, suggesting damage would be severe in the shanty towns that sit on the outskirts of the sprawling riverside city of 5 million. Foreign aid workers, whose movements are restricted by the ruling military junta, had not managed to reach many impoverished areas to assess the impact. ""I have never seen anything like it,"" one retired government worker told Reuters. ""It reminded me of when Hurricane Katrina hit the United States."" Although the sun was shining by Sunday morning, the former capital was without power and water, and food prices had doubled, with many storeholders unsure of when they would be able to replenish stocks. Most shops had sold out of candles. An Electricity Board official said it was impossible to know when the power supply -- hit-and-miss at the best of times in one of Asia's poorest countries -- would be restored. ""We still have to clear the mess,"" the official, who did not want to be named, said. United Nations disaster experts said it would be days before the full extent of the damage was known in a country ruled since 1962 by secretive and ruthless military regimes. Bunkered down in Naypyidaw, the junta's top brass will almost certainly have avoided the worst of the storm. The military authorities declared a disaster in five states and state media carried footage of soldiers clearing trees from roads and Prime Minister Thein Sein, a lieutenant-general, meeting people sheltering in a Buddhist pagoda. DEATH TOLL COULD CLIMB The death toll could climb yet further as authorities slowly make contact with outlying towns and villages along the coast, where weather forecasters had predicted a storm surge of up to 12 feet. They are also likely to uncover victims beneath some of the buildings that collapsed in Yangon under the force of the cyclone, which had been gathering steam for several days in the tropical waters of the Bay of Bengal. ""It was a direct hit on a major city,"" said Terje Skavdal, regional head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). ""The government did warn people to stay inside and that might have had an impact, but the material damage is enormous for sure,"" Skavdal said. The U.N. had made an offer of assistance but was yet to receive a response from the junta, he added. It remains to be seen what impact the storm will have on a referendum on an army-drafted constitution scheduled for May 10. The charter is part of a ""roadmap to democracy"" meant to culminate in multiparty elections in 2010 and end nearly five decades of military rule. The opposition and Western governments say it allows the army to retain too much control. An official at Yangon International Airport said all incoming flights had been diverted to the second city of Mandalay, in the middle of the southeast Asian nation, and all departures from Yangon had been cancelled.

The 29-year-old England midfielder, whose mother Pat died at 58 from pneumonia last Thursday, then let his guard down and wept with emotion while his celebrating team mates swamped him. The goal, after 98 minutes of a pulsating Champions League semi-final second leg against Liverpool, turned the match Chelsea's way, put them 2-1 ahead and in sight of the final in Moscow. Seven minutes later Didier Drogba scored his second goal of the night to make it 3-1 and although Liverpool hit back through Ryan Babel, Chelsea survived to win 4-3 on aggregate and set up an all-English final against Manchester United on May 21. Lampard, so often Chelsea's driving force and saviour, had a night to remember. Television pictures showed his father Frank senior, the former West Ham United player, looking on with proud satisfaction after the penalty. His son had not only put Chelsea ahead but also played a major role in Chelsea's opening goal, setting up the move that led to Drogba scoring after 33 minutes. He was crucial to much of Chelsea's midfield superiority on a heavy pitch lashed by rain for almost all the 120 minutes of the match. Although he had not trained as much as usual since his mother's death, Lampard still had the physical and mental strength to influence the game hugely until he came off to a standing ovation close to the end. Chelsea manager Avram Grant said he had decided to select Lampard on Tuesday. ""He's a very brave man. He was very close to his mother,"" Grant said. ""It was his decision to return to training."" Drogba paid tribute to his team mate. ""It was very special penalty,"" he said. ""Only Frank Lampard could do that. It was a difficult moment for him but he knew the whole club was behind him."

en.15.65.126.2008.5.3,China condemns Dalai Lama ahead of planned talks,"Beijing, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Beijing lambasted the Dalai Lama as a criminal on Saturday as representatives of the exiled Buddhist leader headed for a meeting in southern China on the most serious unrest in Tibet for nearly two decades. The barrage of criticism suggested the government was in no mood to compromise following riots and protests in Tibet, which have shaken China's preparations for the Beijing Olympics and stoked Western criticism of its rule in the mountain region. ""Patriotic people of Tibet strongly condemn and vehemently denounce the litany of crimes committed by the 14th Dalai Lama and his followers,"" said the official Tibet Daily, according to the region's official news Website (www.chinatibetnews.com). ""They (the aides) should have reached China ... we can't have great expectations (about the talks),"" Chhime Chhoekyapa, a senior aide to the Dalai Lama, told Reuters in Dharamsala. He said the venue for the meeting would be Shenzhen, a boomtown across the border from Hong Kong in southern China. The Olympic torch's world tour has been dogged by protests over China's rule in Tibet that have angered Beijing and provoked counter-rallies both at home and abroad by patriotic Chinese. China proposed the talks last week after Western governments urged it to open new dialogue with the Dalai Lama, who says he wants a high level of autonomy and religious freedom for the homeland he fled in 1959. ""BOUT OF MADNESS"" The Tibet Daily repeated charges that the Dalai Lama's ""clique"" orchestrated deadly riots on March 14 in the regional capital, Lhasa, to wreck preparations for August's Olympics. ""The Dalai clique's hopes of achieving Tibetan independence are increasingly dim, and at this time when their hopes have been destroyed, the Dalai clique launched a bloody violent event -- their last bout of madness,"" said the paper. The overseas edition of the People's Daily, the official paper of China's ruling Communist Party, said in a commentary on Saturday that the Dalai's claims that Tibetans lack religious freedom was a figleaf for seeking the region's independence. ""The religion issue is merely a card played by the Dalai clique to garner sympathy from some people,"" it said. The Dalai Lama has said he objects to violence and supports the Beijing Olympics. China says he is insincere. China says the rioting in Lhasa in March killed 18 ""innocent civilians"" and a police officer. It has not clearly specified how many, if any, rioters or protesters have died but says troops used maximum restraint and avoided using lethal weapons. Exiled groups claim many more Tibetans have died in the crackdown. The Tibetan government-in-exile estimated this week that 203 Tibetans may have died in the unrest since March 10. The envoys heading for China for what the Tibetan side called ""informal talks"" are Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari and Kelsang Gyaltsen, both senior and experienced Dalai representatives, experts say. There have been six rounds of dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama's envoys since 2002 with no breakthrough."
en.15.65.132.2008.5.5,Bolivia`s richest region votes `yes` on autonomy,"Santa Cruz, Bolivia, May 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bolivia's richest region of Santa Cruz voted overwhelmingly for autonomy on Sunday in a referendum widely seen as a rejection of President Evo Morales' leftist reforms, exit polls showed. The ballot was the first of four referendums on greater autonomy from central government being planned by eastern provinces, raising tensions between Morales' supporters and the conservative opposition that is concentrated in the east. According to pollster Focaliza, cited by local television, Santa Cruz residents voted 86 percent for the autonomy proposal and 14 percent against. The result had been widely expected because backers of Morales, a former coca farmer and close ally of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, vowed to boycott the referendum. No figures were published on the abstention rate, but a low turnout could weaken the referendum's legitimacy. On the streets of Santa Cruz city, residents honked car horns as they celebrated victory. ""Today a new Bolivia is born,"" Santa Cruz governor Ruben Costas told thousands of supporters in the city's main square where people danced soon after the exit polls were broadcast. Official figures were due to be published on Monday. Voting was mainly calm, but officials said at least 18 people were hurt as supporters and opponents of Morales fought with sticks and stones in Santa Cruz city. One man died after police fired tear gas, a Reuters witness said. The referendum theoretically gives Santa Cruz's conservative leaders more control over natural resources that include fertile farmland and about 10 percent of Bolivia's oil and natural gas reserves. Morales branded the ballot illegal and said more than 50 percent of Santa Cruz voters had either boycotted the vote or voted ""no"". However, he called for talks on the issue with the nation's nine provincial governors. ""I hope the governors can hear me and that together we can guarantee the autonomy of the regions,"" he said in a televised speech after polls closed. NEXT STEP Despite Morales' rejection of the validity of the ballot, the vote could increase pressure him to negotiate with his opponents in Santa Cruz and three other pro-autonomy regions in Bolivia's eastern lowlands. The Amazon provinces of Beni and Pando and natural gas-rich Tarija are preparing to hold similar referendums in the coming months. Growing demands for regional autonomy have exposed a bitter divide between Bolivia's wealthier lowlands and the poor Andean highlands, where tens of thousands of people marched in several cities on Sunday to show support for Morales -- Bolivia's first Indian president. Bolivia is South America's poorest country, but its eastern areas are home to the region's second-largest natural gas reserves after Venezuela and it is a key supplier of the fuel to Brazil and Argentina. As well as energy riches, Santa Cruz has fertile farmland and its population has grown fast over the past 40 years, with Bolivians from the highlands seeking a better life due to its growing economy. Bolivia's highlands are more heavily indigenous, while areas like Santa Cruz have a larger European-descended population. The vast region covers roughly a third of Bolivia's territory and is home to a quarter of the country's roughly 9 million people. Morales has described the Santa Cruz referendum as a bid to destabilize his government, engineered by conservative rivals who oppose his efforts to break up large land holdings and reform the constitution to empower the poor, indigenous majority. The constitutional rewrite was one of Morales' key election pledges along with the energy industry nationalization he declared soon after taking office in 2006. bd"
en.15.65.258.2008.5.1,Democratic battle shifts to Pacific at weekend,"Hagatna, Guam, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - They can't vote for the president, but thousands of people in the tiny US territory of Guam will do their bit to decide the Democratic candidate this weekend. The Pacific Ocean territory, which sends eight delegates with half a vote each to the Democratic convention in August, holds its primary on Saturday with results expected by about 1600 GMT (1200 EST). With Barack Obama leading Hilary Clinton by an estimated 1,733-1,598 in the delegate count, the vote from Guam may not count for much. But the grueling fight between the two has riveted attention in the territory. ""It is a rare opportunity for the citizens of Guam to participate in the presidential primaries in a way that can have real effect,"" said Ron McNinch, a professor of public administration at the University of Guam. ""Usually, the main choices have formed by the time of the Guam process."" Guam, a 212 square mile island in the Western Pacific Ocean, was ceded to U.S. control at the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898. It is the only significantly populated US territory to have ever been occupied by a foreign power -- the Japanese during World War Two. The island returned to US control in 1944. The Americans then built up an air base there, which saw heavy action for bombing runs during the Korean and Vietnam wars. The United States plans to move 8,000 Marines and 10,000 dependents from the southern Japanese island of Okinawa to Guam by 2014 as part of a global realignment of US forces. According to the Guam Election Commission, there are about 48,000 voters out of the island's 170,000 people, and about half of them are registered Democrats. Only about 4,000 of these are likely to vote in the Democratic primary, but that is a huge jump from the 1,500 who voted in 2004. The territory will also send five superdelegates to the Democratic convention. People in Guam vote for a 15-seat unicameral house but have no electoral votes in the US presidential elections. ""While it is ironic that Guamanians cannot vote for president, it is even more ironic that Guam has no voice in the U.S. Senate,"" McNinch said. ""For the first time since President Kennedy was elected in 1960, the president elected in 2008 will come directly from the U.S. Senate. Thus, the people of the US territories face many ironies in their political relationships with the US federal government."" But Guam is an island that has its own priorities. Democratic voters in the village of Inarajan cast their votes for the primary on April 26, so the village could celebrate the Feast of St. Joseph through the weekend of May 3. On an island that has an annual calendar of fiestas set in stone, nobody has found that the least bit extraordinary"

Citing an unnamed high-level Egyptian official, Egypt's state news agency MENA said on Wednesday that Palestinian factions meeting in Cairo had agreed to an Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire starting in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. But a number of factions were equivocal in their support for a truce, and some said they reserved the right to retaliate against Israeli attacks. A member of Israel's security cabinet, who asked not be identified because a truce proposal had not been finalised, said Israel was waiting to see the results of Egyptian mediation. ""There will not be a signed agreement between Israel and Hamas, obviously,"" the official said. ""But there is nothing to stop each side from independently making an undertaking with the Egyptians. That, in effect, would be a tacit truce deal."" Israel, he said ""will almost certainly go along"" with a ceasefire if it ""falls in line with our basic demands -- an end to the violence from Gaza and the arms smuggling fuelling that violence"". The official said his views appeared to be shared by key decision-makers in Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's government and that he expected ""a breakthrough on this matter within days"". Some other Israeli officials, including among the military top brass, have voiced opposition to a truce that could allow Hamas and fellow factions to recover from recent fighting. Islamic Jihad, which frequently launches rockets at Israel, said it could not formally accept a truce agreement that did not also apply at the onset to the occupied West Bank. ""But we will not be the first to violate or undermine it, and we will give a chance for the reopening of (the Gaza Strip's border) crossings and alleviating the suffering of our people,"" Zeyad al-Nakhala, deputy to exiled Islam."
en.15.65.276.2008.5.6,"Obama, Clinton face new tests in White House duel","WASHINGTON, Tue May 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton faced a crucial day in their grueling White House fight on Tuesday, as millions of voters in Indiana and North Carolina cast ballots in the latest Democratic showdowns. The two states, with a combined 187 delegates to the August nominating convention at stake, are the biggest prizes remaining in the tight race to see who will be the party's candidate in the November presidential election. After Tuesday, only six of the state-by-state contests will be left. Obama, who many analysts believed could split the day by winning North Carolina and losing Indiana, declared to reporters as he ate an omelet in Greenwood, Indiana: ""I feel good."" ""I think it's going to be close. I don't think anybody really knows exactly what's going to happen. ... I'm seeing a lot of enthusiasm among the voters. People are just really engaged and excited about this campaign and this process,"" he said. Twin losses could be disastrous for Clinton, who would be the first female US president. The New York senator and former first lady has cut Obama's advantage in North Carolina to single digits in most polls over the past few weeks. The two run closer in Indiana, where Clinton has a slight edge. ""Obviously we hope to do as well as we can, but, you know, we started out pretty far behind,"" she told reporters on her campaign plane late on Monday. ""I never feel confident; I just try to do the best I can."" Her campaign chairman, Terry McAuliffe, predicted on MSNBC -- when pressed -- that Clinton would win Indiana. ""And I think we're closing very fast in North Carolina,"" he said. Polls in both states opened by 7 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) and were scheduled to close in Indiana at 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT) and in North Carolina at 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT), with results expected soon afterward. OBAMA LEADS, HAD ROUGH PATCH Obama, an Illinois senator, has an almost unassailable lead in pledged delegates who will help select the Democratic nominee to face Republican John McCain in November. If Obama wins in both Indiana and North Carolina on Tuesday, it would end Clinton's slender hopes of overtaking him in either delegates or popular votes won in the nomination battle and spark renewed calls for her to step aside. Clinton victories in both states could fuel doubts about Obama's electability and persuade some superdelegates -- party insiders free to back any candidate at the nominating convention -- to move toward her. Neither can win enough delegates to clinch the race before voting ends on June 3, leaving the decision to the nearly 800 superdelegates. A split decision would leave the race largely unchanged before the last six contests, with 217 delegates at stake. Obama has struggled through a rough campaign stretch after last month's loss to Clinton in Pennsylvania, dogged by a furor over his comments on ""bitter"" small-town residents and a controversy over his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Obama, who would be the first black US president, has been backed by nine out of 10 black voters in other states, and is expected to benefit from a strong turnout in North Carolina, where African-Americans could make up more than one-third of those casting ballots in the Democratic primary"

Shyam Benegal, the only director to won India's National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi five times, will direct the movie. ""After getting the consent of Amitabh, I am now a relieved man. To project a person of the magnitude of Bangabandhu (Sheikh Mujib), I could not imagine no one other than him,"" Chowdhury was quoted as saying in New York. ""Now not only Amitabh, his other family members have also agreed to take up the challenge,"" added Chowdhury. It was not clear when Chowdhury will start shooting the film, which will be made in English and dubbed into Bengali, Hindi and other languages.

en.15.65.400.2008.5.2,Gold hits 4-month low after US jobs data,"LONDON, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gold sank to a four-month low on Friday after the dollar jumped following better-than-expected US jobs data, but the metal rebounded when the price dipped below $850 an ounce and attracted fresh buyers, analysts said. Gold fell as low as $845 an ounce before rising to a high of $856.60. It was quoted at $853.90/854.90 at 1302 GMT against $850.25/851.65 in New York late on Thursday. ""The market was sold on the figures because the dollar strengthened dramatically, but there was no follow-through selling and in fact there was some good underlying interest below the $850 level,"" said David Holmes, director of metals sales at Dresdner Kleinwort. ""If we manage to hold above $850 on the close, then I think that's relatively positive,"" he added. The dollar jumped to two-month highs versus the yen and against a basket of currencies after data showed the US economy lost just 20,000 jobs in April, fewer than economists had forecast. The report bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its rate-cutting cycle. It also backed a growing view that the US economic slowdown may not be as deep as some originally thought. A firmer dollar makes gold costlier for holders of other currencies and often lowers bullion demand. The metal is also generally seen as a hedge against oil-led inflation. Oil rebounded above $113 a barrel after three straight days of falls, as concerns about fresh Turkish assaults in northern Iraq outweighed worries about supplies and a firmer US dollar. Turkish warplanes launched intensive bombing raids on Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq overnight on Thursday, but there were no reports about casualties or any impact on oil output from the region. ""The $850 level, which is also 1980's record high, should hold. But if it is broken convincingly, then the whole precious metals complex might go down further,"" said Wolfgang Wrzesniok-Rossbach, head of sales at Heraeus, a German precious metals trading group.

""The confirmed number is 3,934 dead, 41 injured and 2,879 missing within the Yangon and Irrawaddy divisions,"" MRTV reported as aid agencies said hundreds of thousands of people were without shelter and drinking water in the military-ruled Southeast Asian country. Earlier official reports put the death toll at 351, but the number of casualties had been expected to rise as authorities made contact with hard-hit islands and villages in the Irrawaddy delta, the country's rice bowl. Food and fuel prices soared in Yangon on Monday as aid agencies scrambled to deliver emergency supplies and assess the damage from Cyclone Nargis after it slammed into the delta region. The military, which has ruled for 46 years and is shunned by the West, has not issued an appeal for help since the Category 3 storm packing winds of 190 kph (120 mph). In Yangon, many roofs were ripped off even sturdy buildings, suggesting damage would be severe in the shanty towns that lie on the outskirts of the city of 5 million people.

en.15.65.498.2008.4.30,"Famine fears for N Korea, Egypt raises salaries","SEOUL Wed Apr 30,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The chances of famine in North Korea have increased in line with the soaring price of rice on global markets, a Washington-based institute said on Wednesday. ""The country is in its most precarious situation since the end of the famine a decade ago,"" said a paper from the Peterson Institute for International Economics. A jump in prices for foodstuffs has hit many poor nations this year and sparked riots in parts of Africa and Asia. Export restrictions by leading suppliers have fuelled insecurity and market speculation has also pushed prices higher. The head of a new United Nations task force set up to ensure a coordinated international response to the food crisis said malnutrition was more likely than outright famine in most countries, at least in the near future. ""People, particularly those on the lowest incomes, will be eating less and less well,"" John Holmes told a news conference in Geneva. ""I don't think that in the very short term we are talking about starvation and famine."" Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak proposed a 30 percent increase in the salaries of public sector employees to help cover the increasing cost of food while China urged local authorities to ""strictly control"" grain exports. A proposal by Japan to limit restrictions on exports of food got a ""cool response"" on Wednesday, especially from developing countries, the chairman of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) farm talks, New Zealand's Crawford Falconer, said. Japan, the world's third biggest food importer, was joined by Switzerland in proposing limits to restrictions on food exports after moves by several countries to ban or tax exports. RELIED HEAVILY Even in a time of good harvests North Korea finds itself about 20 percent short of what it needs for foodstuffs, Stephan Haggard, co-author of the Peterson Institute paper, said. The secretive nation has grown more dependent on rice imported from neighboring China since a famine in the late 1990s that experts estimate killed at least 1 million people. North Korea has in the past relied heavily on aid from China, South Korea and U.N. aid agencies to fill the gap. But the new conservative government in South Korea has said it will tie aid to progress its neighbor makes in giving up development of nuclear weapons, on which Pyongyang is stalling. China has its own problems keeping runaway grain prices under control, which means it cannot afford to be as generous this year, analysts say. On Wednesday, China's commerce ministry reaffirmed government curbs on grain exports and urged local authorities to increase reserves of grains, meat and cooking oils to ensure supplies and keep food prices in check. China's grain prices are among the lowest in the world as Beijing constantly releases state reserves to keep prices in check. But the rice price in the south has picked up and risen more than 10 percent over the past weeks. On the markets, rice prices in top exporter Thailand dipped below $1,000 a ton as buyers held back from purchases in the hope that prices, which have trebled this year, would ease. On Tuesday, Thailand said it would gradually release 2.1 million tons of stockpiled rice on to the domestic market to ease the plight of Thai consumers, and maintain its 2008 export target of at least 9 million tons. India unveiled measures on Tuesday to safeguard domestic food supplies by imposing export taxes on basmati rice. India, where food often accounts for a much higher proportion of people's expenditure than in developed countries, had already banned non-basmati rice exports. In Egypt, Mubarak's proposal of a public sector salary increase was a response to unrest over high food prices. The poorest Egyptians include the many low-paid civil servants. Urban inflation in the year to March hit 14.4 percent, the highest rate in three years. Bread and grain prices soared 48.1 percent, fruit and vegetable prices rose more than 20 percent, and edible oils were up 45.2 percent. Food price rises are hitting home even in countries such as Kazakhstan, an oil-rich nation which is the world's fifth largest wheat exporter. Alma, who scrapes a living by selling grain and sugar at a bustling market in Kazakhstan, says she cannot afford to buy clothes and other essentials for her family any more. ""All we buy is food, food and food,"" she said as she explained to customers why the price of flour had risen overnight. ""I don't know what will happen tomorrow"

They are Ahmedur Rahman, Jobayedur Rahman Rana, Sajed A Adel, Jobera Rahman Linu, Rafia Akter Dolly and Kazi Shahana Parvin. There will be contest for the posts of three general member -- one from national Olympic events (national federation), one from among Olympiads, and the rest from national women's sports association. The election commission on April 29 announced the schedules for the by-elections to fulfil three member posts, which have remained vacant even after the April 3 election. Some councillors alleged that they were not informed by the BOA office about the election. Ignoring the allegation, BOA chief executive officer retired colonel Waliullah said, ""We have sent letters to all 40 national federations and six divisions on April 29, and we have nothing to do if they are not informed by their respective federations."" Waliullah, however, admitted that they were yet to inform the councillors nominated by the BOA president and the sports and youth ministry, and they were contacting those councillors over the phone. The April 3 election saw only six candidates compete for four positions -- the posts of the secretary general and three members -- as the election commissioner earlier declared 29 candidates unopposed winners for the posts of the president, five vice presidents, three deputy secretaries general, treasurer and 19 members. Of the 37-member executive committee, one post of general member reserved for a member from International Olympic Committee will fall vacants."

Justice Aftab Farrukh, who heads the tribunal, said the ban was delayed until the next hearing on June 4. ""Since it will take time to dispose of Shoaib's regular appeal against the ban the tribunal felt that preventing him from playing in the league would have been an additional penalty on him,"" Farrukh said. ""It would have been an additional penalty which has not even been prescribed by the disciplinary committee of the board which banned him from playing in or for Pakistan but not outside Pakistan.""

en.15.65.336.2008.5.6,China`s Hu urges cooperation ahead of Japan summit,"Tokyo, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese President Hu Jintao lauded closer cooperation with Japan when he arrived on Tuesday for a state visit intended to nurture trust between the Asian powers despite rifts over energy resources and security. Hu was greeted in Tokyo by senior Japanese officials and flag-waving, mostly Chinese well-wishers. Downtown, some 7,000 police were deployed ahead of threatened protests by hundreds of right-wing activists who see China as a danger. But China is promoting itself as a friendly neighbor after years of feuding over Japan's handling of its wartime aggression, and Hu has stressed forward-looking goals for his five days of ceremony, speeches and deals, as well as table tennis and perhaps pandas. China's second ever state visit to Japan comes as it seeks to calm international tensions over Tibetan unrest, which has threatened to mar Beijing's Olympic Games, a showcase of national pride. With the two economies increasingly intertwined, Hu said better ties were important to both countries' prosperity. ""I sincerely hope for generations of friendship between the people of China and Japan,"" Hu wrote in a message to Japanese readers of a Chinese magazine, Xinhua news agency reported. Cooperation has ""brought real benefits to the people of both countries and spurred the growth and development of each,"" Hu said. ""These achievements are worth treasuring by the people of China and Japan."" The Beijing Games were ""Asia's Olympics and the world's Olympics"", Hu added. Certainly much is at stake in ties between Asia's two biggest economies. China replaced the United States as Japan's top trade partner last year, with two-way trade worth $236.6 billion, up 12 percent from 2006. OPPORTUNITIES, ANXIETIES But while China's fast growth offers opportunities, Beijing's accompanying expansion in diplomatic and military reach has stirred deeper anxieties in Japan -- over disputed energy resources, military power and the safety standards of Chinese exports. ""Although the iceberg between China and Japan has melted, fully warming relations require further efforts from both sides,"" a commentator wrote in China's People's Daily on Tuesday. The political climax of Hu's visit is set to be a summit on Wednesday with Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, when they hope to unveil a joint blueprint for managing ties in coming years. But it was unclear whether the avowals of friendship would narrow disagreements or merely bathe them in warm words. Japanese media reports said touchy references in the document to Taiwan, human rights, and Japan's hopes for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council were still under negotiation. The two country's are also quarrelling over the rights to gas beds beneath the East China Sea, while a row over Chinese-made dumplings laced with pesticide that made several people sick has become, analysts say, a symbol of Japanese alarm at China's rise. PING-PONG AND PANDAS Officials from both sides had earlier raised hopes of a breakthrough in the gas dispute before Hu's visit, but a swift compromise seems unlikely. Japan also wants greater transparency about China's surging defense spending, set at 418 billion yuan ($60 billion) for 2008, up 17.6 percent on 2007 and outstripping Japan's defense budget. Foreign critics say China's real military budget is much higher. Tokyo wants Chinese backing for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an issue that in 2005 fuelled anti-Japanese protests in China, where there is deep rancor over Japan's harsh 1931-1945 occupation of much of the country. A mainland China-run Hong Kong paper, the Ta Kung Pao, indicated that Hu was unlikely to meet Japanese hopes. ""There are several touchy issues that it will be very difficult for this trip to settle,"" said the paper, citing the gas dispute and the Security Council issue. ""At the least, the time isn't ripe...But reaching some vague understandings may be possible."" For its part, China has pressed Japan to spell out again its stance on Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing says must accept reunification. Tokyo has said it supports ""one China"" that includes Taiwan, which was a Japanese colony for fifty years until 1945 and keeps close ties to Japan. Still, the two sides are keen to stress forward-looking goodwill and are to issue a joint document on fighting climate change, a key topic for Japan as host of the July G8 summit. Hu will give a speech to university students in Tokyo, he may play table tennis with Fukuda and he might also offer Japan a panda to replace one that died in a Tokyo zoo in April. ($1=6.988 Yuan"
en.15.65.398.2008.5.2,Putin`s legacy: strong Russia with a Soviet flavor,"Moscow, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - When Russian President Vladimir Putin steps down next week after eight years in power, he will leave behind him a strong Russia, self-confident at home and assertive abroad. But the smack of the Soviet past can be felt distinctly in the legacy that Putin, a steely-eyed former KGB spy, will hand over to his protege Dmitry Medvedev, who will be sworn in as the new president on May 7. Russia was in ruins when Putin became president in 1999. Its economy was spluttering, the country's cohesion was threatened by independent-minded regional leaders, a separatist rebellion in Chechnya and a wave of violent attacks across the country. Eight years on, Russia is very different country and voters give Putin much of the credit -- he bows out with an unprecedented popularity rating of about 70 percent. He will stay on as a powerful prime minister. ""We have restored the territorial integrity and unity of our nation, we have recreated the state,"" he has said, summing up his key achievements. ""We have restored the fundamental basis of the Russian economy and are turning into an economic leader."" Chechnya has been largely pacified and key rebel leaders have been killed, although a small-scale Islamist insurgency is still causing instability in the regions around it. The one-trillion-dollar economy, helped by high energy prices and liberal market reforms launched in the first years of Putin's rule, is booming with hefty 7 percent annual growth. Big Russian firms are elbowing their way into Western markets. ""We feel more confident now,"" Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin has said. ""The government no longer needs to plug holes and can focus on long-term goals."" ""I read newspapers again because I find things to be proud of there,"" said Oleg Georgiyevich, a pensioner who came to watch tanks and missile launchers rolling through Moscow as they rehearsed for a May 9 parade -- a revival of a Soviet-era tradition. WORRYING SIGNS But a vocal minority of Russians, along with Western governments and rights groups, see worrying signs. ""Putin's main achievement is a spectacular return to the Soviet epoch,"" author and opposition activist Zakhar Prilepin said in the Internet publication Izbrannoye (www.izbrannoye.ru). Putin's rule has seen a rolling back of political freedoms introduced under his predecessor Boris Yeltsin. Hitherto elected regional governors are now effectively appointed by the Kremlin. Parliament, once the scene of political battles, has become under Putin a docile chamber that rubber-stamps the Kremlin's decisions. Opposition parties complain they have been sidelined by a Kremlin campaign of harassment and elections rigged to favor Putin's United Russia party. The Kremlin says the opposition has lost ground because it is out of touch with what voters want. Russia's main television stations and biggest newspapers are either controlled by the state or Kremlin-friendly businessmen, and have become deferential in their reporting. At the grass roots, the pervasive influence of Putin's tightening control is felt too. ""I had to get a United Russia membership card,"" said a 50-year-old businessman from the provincial city of Yaroslavl. ""It is now an entry ticket to official contacts and protects you from problems, exactly like the Communist Party card worked in the Soviet Union."" Putin argues that the Kremlin needed to wield stronger political powers to ensure economic growth and avert the disintegration of the country. He also defends another element of his legacy: increasing government involvement in the economy. Some international companies have been forced to give up their stakes in lucrative energy projects and state corporations are mushrooming. Many investors were alarmed at the way the Russian state dismantled the Yukos oil company, arrested its top executives and sold off its best assets to the state-owned Rosneft in auctions which lacked transparency. Business leaders -- careful since the Yukos case to stay away from politics -- are now warning that too much state intervention could harm the economy. ""There should be clarity about the role of the state and private business in the economy,"" the influential head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Alexander Shokhin, told Medvedev at a meeting last month."

Sawers, the current council president, and South African Ambassador Dumisani Kumalo will lead the mission, which will leave New York on May 31 and spend the first 10 days of June in Africa. The party, grouping representatives of the 15 nations on the council, will visit Kenya, where it will consider the Somali problem, Sudan -- including the semi-independent south and the violence-torn western region of Darfur -- Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ivory Coast, Sawers said. The United Nations has peacekeeping missions in all those countries except Kenya and is contemplating whether to boost the U.N. presence in Somalia, where the Ethiopian-backed government is struggling against Islamist insurgents. Asked at a news conference whether the group would visit Somalia itself, Sawers said, ""The plan at the moment is not to go to Somalia."" But he added: ""We're going to the borders of Somalia and we will determine exactly what our itinerary is nearer the time, based on security conditions."" In Chad, the United Nations is deploying police to accompany a European Union peacekeeping force in the east, where some half a million Sudanese refugees and displaced Chadians are encamped. Congo and Ivory Coast are both seeking to recover from civil wars. Congo, where violence persists in the east, hosts the world's largest U.N. peace force, some 17,000-strong. Ivory Coast has scheduled a presidential election for November 30."

""Potato production has seen a great success this year. This year the growth of potatoes has been recorded at 60 percent,"" the adviser said Wednesday in his speech to the inauguration of a three-day national campaign for people to increase potato intake. CSD (Canteen Stores Department) Bangladesh and Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations have organised the campaign from Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. Asia produces half of the world's potatoes, with Bangladesh accounting for up to 3 percent of total output. Army chief Moeen U Ahmed, who was the special guest at the programme, said: ""Stand beside 2.50 crore farmers who grow food for 15 crore people."" ""The country generally faces rice shortage in March and April when potato is harvested. If we increase potato consumption this time it will reduce pressure on rice,"" General Moeen said. ""Bangladesh faces different natural disasters every year.

The army chief said the United Nations had urged the world population to increase potato consumption, declaring 2008 as World Potato Year, as potato production is higher this year the world over. Bangladesh responded to the call of the UN and launched its campaign, he said.

en.15.65.496.2008.5.1,UN council urges realism in Western Sahara dispute,"United Nations, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN Security Council passed a resolution on Wednesday calling for ""realism"" in Western Sahara in what diplomats saw as a boost for Morocco in its dispute with the Polisario independence movement. The council passed the resolution unanimously after several hours of haggling over the details and despite strong objections by South Africa and Costa Rica to language they said implied support for Morocco in the dispute. Earlier in April, the UN mediator on Western Sahara sparked division in the Security Council when he told members independence for the disputed territory was unrealistic. The assessment by envoy Peter van Walsum put him at odds with Polisario, which has sought to keep the independence option open in four rounds of talks with Morocco, which annexed the former Spanish colony in 1975. Talks resumed a year ago to try to bridge the gap between rival plans put forward by the two sides. Morocco offered autonomy for the resource-rich territory of 260,000 people but ruled out independence, while Polisario urged a referendum with independence as one option. The negotiations have made little headway. Further talks are planned but no date has been set. The Wednesday resolution renewed the mandate of a UN peacekeeping force for a year and welcomed ""serious and credible Moroccan efforts"" to move the process forward, while ""taking note"" of Polisario's proposals. It also endorsed a report by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that ""realism and a spirit of compromise by the parties are essential to maintain the momentum of the process of negotiations."" The report expressed no view on the merits of the two plans, but Polisario and its supporters take the term realism to imply that the independence idea should be dropped. 'MIGHT IS RIGHT' The current Security Council president, Ambassador Dumisani Kumalo of South Africa, told reporters earlier he was not happy about the inclusion of the reference to realism at the initiative of powerful countries friendly to Morocco. In a statement to the council after the vote, he said the reference to realism could set a precedent in other conflicts, such as that between Israelis and Palestinians, that the principle ""might is right"" would hold sway. ""This council has made a mistake. They sent a wrong message to Morocco, thinking that they will always support Morocco,"" Kumalo told reporters after the vote, adding that he nevertheless voted in favor because he still held out hopes for the negotiations. U.S. deputy ambassador Alejandro Wolff indicated Washington was in favor of autonomy, under a mutually agreed solution. ""The best way to move forward, in our view, the realistic way to move forward, is to pursue a negotiated solution resulting in true autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty for the Polisario,"" Wolff told reporters. Kumalo also complained that the resolution drafted by France, Russia, Spain, Britain and the United States omitted any reference to human rights, a sensitive subject for Morocco. He said such an omission was a case of double standards. In his assessment, van Walsum said he had ""concluded that there was no pressure on Morocco to abandon its claim of sovereignty over the territory and, therefore, that an independent Western Sahara was not a realistic proposition."" Morocco's seizure of Western Sahara prompted a guerrilla war for independence until a UN-brokered cease-fire in 1991. The desert territory on Africa's Atlantic coast holds phosphates, rich fisheries and, potentially, offshore oil"
en.15.65.370.2008.5.1,Austria appeals for witnesses to incest horror,"Amstetten, Austria, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police on Wednesday appealed to about a hundred people to help them piece together details of a quarter-century of incarceration of an Austrian woman and her children by her father and sexual tormentor. Investigator Franz Polzer asked for help from all those who had lived in the block in the small town of Amstetten in whose cellar Josef Fritzl imprisoned his daughter Elisabeth in 1984, and then fathered seven children by her. ""I ask if perhaps any one of them may have seen something noteworthy that at the time may have seemed insignificant,"" Polzer told a news conference. Incredulity is driving a judicial and public effort to understand how a man could have entombed his daughter under the noses of residents and authorities, and then kept three of the children he fathered with her underground their entire lives. Austrian and German media reports have shown pictures and video clips of Fritzl contentedly holidaying without family members in Thailand and Cyprus. Polzer said the cellar, which was sealed off behind a locked sliding concrete door, included separate sleeping, washing and cooking areas, and was equipped with a refrigerator, freezer and washing machine. ""This electrical equipment would have allowed the occupants of the dungeon to have survived for weeks,"" he said. Two of the children who had lived in the cellar have now been reunited with three other siblings who were taken in as infants and raised by Josef and his wife Rosemarie. ""Yesterday we had a small improvised birthday celebration for the 12-year-old, with a birthday cake,"" Berthold Kepplinger, medical director of the provincial clinic of Lower Austria, told the same news conference.. CHILD IN HOSPITAL The eldest child, aged 19, remains seriously ill in hospital, where she was taken last week -- the first time she had left the windowless cellar. Josef Fritzl, who has admitted incarceration and incest, is now in detention and under investigation on suspicion of rape, incest and coercion. He is also being investigated for murder through neglect of a seventh child, which died shortly after birth, and whose remains he burnt in a furnace. Fritzl's lawyer, renowned defence attorney Rudolf Mayer, said his client was refusing to answer further questions. ""He has given police a comprehensive statement,"" Mayer told APA news agency. ""At present there is no need for further questioning ... ""The DNA traces are clear and this would prove the incest. But the rape has not been proven at all, let alone the enslavement and the murder that have been talked about. Nothing has been proven there."" The case comes less than two years after an Austrian teenager, Natascha Kampusch, escaped from the basement where she had been locked up by an abductor for eight years. Local authorities say they do not blame officials for failing to discover the case earlier. They say those who allowed Fritzl and his wife -- who had six other grown-up children of their own -- to take in three of Elisabeth's children were acting within the law. The case spurred Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer to announce an image campaign to restore Austria's reputation abroad. ""It's not Austria that is the perpetrator. This is an unfathomable criminal case, but also an isolated case,"" he told journalists in Vienna"

en.15.65.145.2008.5.4,Microsoft withdraws offer for Yahoo,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Microsoft Corp walked away from its bid to buy Yahoo Inc on Saturday after the Internet company turned down its offer to raise the price by $5 billion to $47.5 billion. Microsoft's offer was for $33 a share but Yahoo would not lower its demand below $37, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said. The software company initially bid $31 per share for Yahoo more than three months ago. ""We believe the economics demanded by Yahoo do not make sense for us, and it is in the best interests of Microsoft stockholders, employees and other stakeholders to withdraw our proposal,"" Ballmer said in a statement. Analysts say Yahoo has overplayed its hand and they expect the Web pioneer's shares to fall as much as 30 percent to $20 levels when Nasdaq trading resumes on Monday. The stock rose nearly 7 percent to $28.67 on Friday on hopes of an agreement between Microsoft and Yahoo. ""Wow. I'm shocked Yahoo wasn't more reasonable. The stock will probably go down at least $5 on Monday. It is surprising that Ballmer walked away instead of trying a hostile bid at $33,"" said Walter Price, a senior portfolio manager at RCM fund management company in San Francisco, which had 21 million Microsoft shares and 2 million Yahoo shares as of the end of December. Laura Martin, a senior analyst at Soleil Securities, said she expected a number of shareholder lawsuits against Yahoo. ""The Yahoo guys want too much money for their company. We think $33 a share is fair in the context of the weakening economic environment and adverse advertising trends,"" she said. ""They've prioritized employees over shareholders in the hopes that someday they can create more than $8 billion of value, even if they have no track record of doing so,"" she said. Some Wall Street analysts also have said Microsoft could pull its bid as a negotiating strategy aimed at putting pressure on Yahoo to eventually accept a future offer. GOOGLE DEAL NEXT WEEK? Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock said in a statement the company believed from the beginning that Microsoft's offer undervalued it, and the board was ""pleased that so many of our shareholders joined us in expressing that view."" He said Yahoo was pursuing ""strategic opportunities"" but gave no details. Yahoo has courted possible deals with Time Warner Inc's AOL Internet division or News Corp's MySpace online social network, and tested a search advertising partnership with Google Inc. A partnership with Google may be announced as early as next week, a person with knowledge of discussions told Reuters. ""With the distraction of Microsoft's unsolicited proposal now behind us, we will be able to focus all of our energies on executing the most important transition in our history so that we can maximize our potential to the benefit of our shareholders, employees, partners and users,"" Yahoo co-founder and Chief Executive Jerry Yang said in a statement. Jordan Rohan, founder of digital media advisory firm Clearmeadow Partners, said Yahoo could name Time Warner as a partner or buy AOL to put a positive spin on the situation, but neither option would give as good a payoff to shareholders. ""Yahoo management and board overplayed its hand. Shareholders were cheated out of a victory,"" Rohan said. ""I think Yahoo forgot what it felt like to have a share price under $20. They may be reminded soon."" Ballmer cited Yahoo's Google plans as one reason Microsoft was walking away rather than mounting a hostile offer. ""We regard with particular concern your apparent planning to respond to a 'hostile' bid by pursuing a new arrangement that would involve or lead to the outsourcing to Google of key paid Internet search terms offered by Yahoo today,"" Ballmer said in a letter to Yang, made public on Saturday. ""In our view, such an arrangement with the dominant search provider would make an acquisition of Yahoo undesirable to us."" REALLY WALKING? Microsoft wants to buy Yahoo to gain a stronger foothold in its battle with Google, which is expanding rapidly into the software maker's own turf with new Web-based applications. Technology analysts say Microsoft may not really walk away from Yahoo, and Saturday's move could parallel Oracle Corp's strategy in winning over BEA Systems Inc. Oracle pulled its offer in October 2007, leading BEA shares to fall 6 percent. Despite the tough talk, the companies reached an agreement in January this year. Although Microsoft has not succeeded in sealing a deal, tough talk by Ballmer has already brought Yahoo to the negotiating table. According to a person familiar with Microsoft's thinking, Yahoo's advisers said initially it would not negotiate with Microsoft for anything less than $40 a share. But amid threats by Microsoft to launch a hostile takeover, Yang suggested a price of $38 a share, the person said. On Saturday, Yang and Yahoo co-founder David Filo met Ballmer and Microsoft's Platforms & Services Division President Kevin Johnson in Seattle, where they communicated that Yahoo's board was willing to cut a deal at $37 a share, although the two co-founders remained committed to a dollar more per share, the source said. Price was not the only stumbling block, another person familiar with the discussions said. Microsoft had also failed to respond adequately to antitrust regulatory concerns that Yahoo raised at several meetings, said the source who was not authorized to speak on the record. Yahoo also wanted ""value-certainty"" assurances the value of Microsoft's offer would remain the same when the deal, if it did get done, closed, the person said."
en.15.65.202.2008.5.6,Climbers prepare for final torch assault on Everest,"Everest Base Camp, China, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A total of 31 Chinese climbers, 22 of them ethnic Tibetans, are on Mount Everest fixing routes and repairing camps for the final assault on the summit with the Beijing Olympic torch, officials said on Tuesday. In a departure from the usual tight control of information about the project, China mountaineering team spokesman Zhang Zhijian listed the full team of climbers, which also includes eight Han Chinese and one climber from the Tujia minority. Zhang would not disclose when the final ascent would take place and said the heavy snow over the weekend had been a minor setback to the task of getting the Olympic flame to the top of the world's highest mountain. ""The heavy snowfall has destroyed the routes we fixed and the camps we had prepared,"" he told a news briefing. ""Our climbing torch bearers are busy rebuilding the routes and camps. It has affected us a little but not too much."" The three women in the climbing team include experienced 39-year-old Ji Ji, whose husband Rena was killed when a rockslide hit his car on his way to climb the 8,080 meter (26,509 ft) Gasherbrum 1 peak in Pakistan in 2005. In 1999, Ji Ji and Rena became the third married couple to summit Everest together. Ji Ji returned to Pakistan last year to claim the Gasherbrum 1 peak, the world's 11th highest, for her late husband. The oldest climber is 45-year-old Luoze, while teenager Ding Chen, still a couple of months shy of his 20th birthday, is the youngest. Zhang said the team had been selected for their passion for the Olympics, their physical condition and recommendation by their work unit or institution. ""Many of them are not professional climbers, especially the Han Chinese,"" he said. ""They are mainly university students, but they have the passion. They do have experience of climbing at least one summit of more than 6,000 meters."" The flame that will be taken to the Everest peak was taken from the main Olympic torch when it arrived in Beijing in March. Organizers have kept plans for the ascent a closely guarded secret for fear that it may be hit by protests. Anti-Chinese demonstrations disrupted the international stretch of the longest torch relay in Olympic history after the March 14 riots in Lhasa sparked off unrest in Tibetan areas of western China"
en.15.65.388.2008.5.7,"Sixty years on, Palestinians mourn loss of homeland","Burj Al Barajneh, Lebanon, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - While Israel celebrates its 60th birthday, Palestinian refugees mourn the 1948 Nakba (catastrophe) when they lost their homeland. Often ignored in Middle East peace talks, they cling to a ""right of return"". Alia Shabati was 12 when she fled Jewish attacks on her village of Kabri, captured a few days after Israel's creation. Now a matron of 72, wearing a flowery blue dress and white headscarf, her memories of Kabri in today's northern Israel are vividly intact, unlike the village, which was wiped off the map. ""We had houses and land,"" Shabati said in the living room of her modest dwelling in the alleys of Beirut's Burj al-Barajneh refugee camp. ""We had olives, grapes, prickly pears and dates. We had orchards and fields. Now what do we have? Nothing."" Her life story encapsulates the bitterness of dispossession and exile familiar to about 4.5 million Palestinian refugees and their descendants in squalid camps in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the occupied West Bank and Gaza, or in a wider diaspora. For Shabati, who has lost three of her 11 children, her tale is unique. ""What I tasted, no one has tasted,"" she said. Her father was killed by British forces during a Palestinian revolt in 1936, shortly after she was born. Twelve years later, she fled Kabri with her mother, brother and grandmother, along with other women and children, after an attack by Jewish Haganah forces. Her uncle and several other relatives who stayed behind were among those killed. Shabati recalls walking exhausted from one village to another, finding safety nowhere, until the Kabri survivors crossed the border into Lebanon and were taken to Syria. ETHNIC CLEANSING? The fate of Kabri was part of what Palestinians -- and some Israeli scholars -- say was systematic ethnic cleansing ordered by Zionist leaders to clear the way for the Jewish state. Israel rejects this, saying the refugee problem resulted from a war launched by Palestinians opposed to the U.N. partition plan adopted on November 29, 1947, and by Arab states which invaded as soon as the British Mandate expired on May 15, 1948. The upshot was that of the nearly 1.4 million Arabs who lived in Palestine in 1947 more than 700,000 had been displaced from their homes by 1949, according to a consensus view. Before fighting began in late 1947, about a million Arabs and 600,000 Jews lived in what was to become Israel. Israel emerged with 78 percent of Mandate Palestine. The U.N. plan, rejected by the Arabs, would have given it 56 percent. At 12, Shabati may have only dimly grasped the conflict over her homeland, but she soon felt what it was to be a refugee. Among the hardships and humiliations along the way, she remembers how some Syrian villagers began picking brides from her bedraggled group, until a policeman scolded them for abusing their guests. ""We felt as if knives were striking us,"" she said. After seven years in a refugee camp in Syria, Shabati got married and came to Burj al-Barajneh, on the edge of Beirut, where she raised a family with her husband, a yoghurt vendor. Their 23-year-old son Mohammed was killed fighting Israeli troops who invaded Lebanon to drive out PLO guerrillas in 1982. His brother Ali, 24, was killed in 1985 when Lebanese Shi'ite Amal militiamen assaulted Palestinian camps in Beirut. Shabati dreams of going back to Kabri, even if she had to live in a tent again. ""I'd walk, as long as I could return,"" she said, scorning a query on whether she would consider moving to an eventual Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. LEBANESE RESTRICTIONS Palestinians are treated worse in Lebanon than other Arab countries such as Jordan, where they have full citizenship, and Syria, where they enjoy civil but not political rights. ""They have had a particular history of subjection to violence and massacre, and of marginalization and exclusion by the Lebanese authorities through legal and other means,"" said Yezid Sayigh, a Palestinian scholar at Cambridge University. Shabati's 35-year-old son Idriss said Lebanese laws that bar Palestinians from 70 professions had hit a raw nerve after he realized his son could not hope to become a lawyer or a doctor. ""You can't live your life as a citizen here,"" he complained. Lebanese restrictions on refugees, slightly eased by the current government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, were designed to deter the mainly Sunni Muslim Palestinians from settling permanently and upsetting Lebanon's sectarian balance. Israel firmly opposes letting any refugees return to their original homes, on the grounds that this would effectively destroy the Jewish state by threatening its Jewish majority. The PLO has accepted the conciliatory wording of an Arab League peace plan calling for a ""just and agreed solution"" in line with a U.N. resolution proposing return or compensation for refugees willing to live at peace with their neighbors. ""At the end of the day, everything is negotiable,"" said Basel Aql, a founder of the Palestine Liberation Organization and former adviser to the late PLO leader Yasser Arafat. Aql, whose family fled the coastal city of Jaffa in 1948, acknowledged that refugee interests had not been fully taken into account -- ""not because we willingly gave up our right to return, but the balance of power was such that the question of refugees did not have priority on any of the agendas"". WISHES IGNORED Refugees have rarely been consulted about their wishes and have had little say in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks over the past 15 years aiming for a two-state solution, Sayigh said. ""The tendency is to regard them as an actual or potential obstacle to peace,"" he said, adding that this attitude was not confined to Israel or its staunch ally, the United States. ""A chunk of the Palestinian leadership has also treated them as potential trouble-makers, who might wreck a peace deal."" For now a final peace agreement seems remote, but many Palestinians yearn for some Israeli admission of responsibility for what they see as the historic injustice done to them. ""You need to acknowledge what happened in 1948,"" said Reem Kelani, a British-based singer who has recorded many traditional Palestinian songs. ""If you don't want to apologize, just acknowledge it, and then just maybe we could start something."" Palestinians in the camps or the diaspora should mark this month's anniversary by reaffirming their identity, she said. ""To me, it's celebrating the Palestinian cultural narrative before, during and after 1948. It's not just about victimhood."" In recent years, camp conditions have worsened everywhere as UNRWA, the cash-strapped agency that helps Palestinian refugees, becomes less able to provide adequate health and education. ""Palestinian refugees now, more than at any time in the last 60 years, face a serious decline in services,"" said Sayigh. ""They are going to become once again the most vulnerable community by every indicator,"" the Palestinian academic added. ""We are looking at the re-emergence of a true under-class."""
en.15.65.303.2008.5.1,US air strike kills al Qaeda boss in Somalia,"Mogadishu, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US air strike killed an Islamist commander thought to be al Qaeda's top man in Somalia, the insurgents and witnesses said on Thursday. Aden Hashi Ayro, who led al Shabaab militants blamed for near daily attacks on government troops and their Ethiopian allies, died in the latest of several US bombings in recent months to have targeted Somali rebel leaders. ""It is true, infidel planes bombed Dusamareb,"" another senior Shabaab commander, Mukhtar Ali Robow, told Reuters by telephone, referring to a small town in central Somalia. ""Two of our important people, including Ayro, were killed."" Residents said other Shabaab fighters and at least one civilian were killed in the pre-dawn air strike. ""I could see pieces of human bodies lying outside the house,"" said one local man who asked not to be named. ""It was difficult to go near because of heavily armed Islamists guarding the area."" Amina Warsame, another witness, said residents were woken at around 2 a.m. (Wednesday 2300 GMT) by two huge blasts. ""When we came out, we saw a home in the neighborhood entirely destroyed ... We counted four planes flying over us,"" she said. In late February, Washington officially designated the al Shabaab as a terrorist organization, saying it had close ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda. Security and intelligence sources say Ayro trained in assassination and insurgency tactics in Afghanistan in the late 1990s. In his 30s, he has been in hiding since his hardline sharia courts group was ousted from Mogadishu at the start of 2007. In rare taped comments released in November, the Islamist commander ordered his fighters to attack African Union peacekeepers based in the coastal capital. Civilians in the city have borne the brunt of fighting between the rebels and allied Somali-Ethiopian forces. A local rights group says clashes in Mogadishu killed some 6,500 residents last year alone"
en.15.65.128.2008.5.1,Russia stoking tension by Abkhazia troop boost: NATO,"Brussels, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO accused Moscow on Wednesday of stoking tensions by announcing a troop build-up in Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region which risked undermining stability in the country. Member states' envoys to NATO met Dmitry Rogozin, Russia's permanent representative to the alliance, NATO for what was ""a clear and sometimes sharp exchange of views, but absolutely no meeting of the minds"", a NATO spokesman said. The ambassadors of the US-led alliance expressed ""clearly and unanimously"" their concern about Russian moves to establish legal links to Abkhazia and a second separatist region, South Ossetia, saying it undermined Georgian sovereignty. They also called for an international probe of the shooting down of a Georgian drone last weekend and said Russia's announcement on Tuesday that it would send more troops to Abkhazia without Georgian permission ""risks undermining stability in that country"", the spokesman said. Russia said it was sending the extra peacekeeping troops to counter what it called Georgian plans for an attack, prompting the European Union to accuse it of stoking tensions. The NATO spokesman, James Appathurai, said Moscow might be technically entitled to raise its troop levels, but ""in the political reality, this is not easing tensions, it is raising tensions."" According to the mandate for Abkhazia peacekeeping, plans for deployments had to be approved by the conflicting sides, ""and the Georgian side has made clear it would not approve"". ""CONCERN"" ""NATO is watching with concern. It wants to see all parties avoid the kind of rhetoric that we have seen that is escalating tension and not take steps...to undermine what is already a fragile situation,"" Appathurai said. ""The allies are unanimous in supporting and endorsing Georgia's territorial integrity."" The crisis between the small Transcaucasian country, a vital energy transit route, and its former Soviet master has alarmed NATO allies, which see Georgia as a future member. On Monday, NATO ambassadors met Georgian presidential envoy David Bakradze in Brussels. They reiterated support for Georgia and criticized Russia for warning about possible use of force. In a further show of support, NATO also announced plans for the envoys to visit Georgia before the end of the year. On Wednesday, NATO announced plans for a similar mission in June to Ukraine, another ex-Soviet state the alliance has said will one day join the 26-nation alliance. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov repeated after meeting EU ministers on Tuesday that Moscow would use military force if Georgia attacked Abkhazia or South Ossetia. EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said after the talks the Russian deployment of extra peacekeepers was unwise. Bakradze met Solana in Brussels on Wednesday and called on the EU to increase its presence in the country. ""The more EU presence we have, the less chances there are that there will be destabilization and that Russia's provocations will be successful,"" he told reporters"
en.15.65.402.2008.5.1,Chelsea's Drogba answers criticism with inspired display,"LONDON, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Didier Drogba produced a masterful display of the centre forward arts on Wednesday to shoot Chelsea into their first Champions League final and answer the criticism of Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez. The Spaniard described Drogba as a serial diver in the build-up to the second leg of their semi-final at Stamford Bridge, an accusation that has dogged the muscular Ivory Coast captain since he arrived in London from Olympique Marseilles. ""He (Drogba) is very, very strong but he falls down. He slips a lot,"" Benitez had told reporters on Tuesday. ""Everybody can see this every game, it is very clear"" Liverpool's manager must have wished he had kept his thoughts to himself as the 30-year-old striker turned in a performance of power and strength to end the Spaniard's hopes of a third Champions League final in his Anfield reign. ""Benitez is a fantastic coach one of the best in the world and I was a little disappointed but perhaps he thought his team wasn't strong enough,"" Drogba said of Benitez's remarks after Chelsea's 3-2 win at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. ""It (the publicity over Benitez's comments) does nothing for my image and I am doing everything to promote English football, and it is not good and not fair but it is finished now."" FEW BETTER Drogba has scored 18 goals in the Champions League during his Chelsea career, six of them this season. When he stays on his feet, as he mostly managed to on Wednesday, there are few better strikers in world football. Fernando Torres, Liverpool's prolific Spaniard, did cancel out Drogba's clinical 33rd-minute opener, but it was Drogba who won their personal duel for superiority. After crashing a shot inside Pepe Reina's near post Drogba stormed towards the Liverpool technical area, sliding to his knees in front of Benitez. The stare said everything, the message was crystal clear. It was not just his hold-up play and his power in attack that caught the eye. When he was not marauding towards the Liverpool goal he proved a useful addition to Chelsea's rearguard. One tackle on Dirk Kuyt in the first half when the Dutch forward was about to shoot would have had Chelsea skipper John Terry purring with delight. His second strike to give Chelsea a two-goal margin in extra time was a blur of movement as he connected first time with a low cross from Nicolas Anelka. Drogba now has his sights on Manchester United in next month's Moscow showpiece and is determined to make up for his previous European final when he was part of the Marseilles team beaten in the UEFA Cup by Benitez's Valencia in 2004. ""I would rather lose in the semi-final than a final in Europe,"" Drogba told reporters. ""The semi-final you are upset for two or three days but to lose a final hurts for years."
en.15.65.491.2008.4.30,Paul Scholes strike sends United into final,"MANCHESTER, April 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A stunning goal from Paul Scholes gave Manchester United a 1-0 win over Barcelona on Tuesday to set up an all-English Champions League final against either Liverpool or Chelsea in Moscow next month. On a night of drama at Old Trafford in which Barcelona played some outstanding attacking football, it was hardly more fitting that Scholes scored the goal that secured his club their place in the showdown at the Luzhniki Stadium on May 21. ""(He's) one of our great players. He came through the ranks and he knows about this club. I'm so pleased for everyone,"" United manager Alex Ferguson told ITV television. ""It was marvellous, this club deserves to be in the final, for the history and the support. Fantastic."" Scholes was suspended for United's epic victory over Bayern Munich in the 1999 final, and Ferguson had already said he would play in the final if they qualified. He duly responded with a brilliant swerving shot that went high and wide of goalkeeper Victor Valdes in the 14th minute of the semi-final, second leg to give United a 1-0 aggregate victory. It will be United's third European Cup final following their earlier successes over Benfica at Wembley in 1968 and Bayern at Barcelona in 1999 when they won the treble of European Cup, FA Cup and Premier League. They are now chasing a double of Champions League and Premier League titles. Barcelona, and especially their Argentine winger Lionel Messi, threatened time and again with some inspired approach play but were thwarted by brilliant defending from United's back line with defenders Rio Ferdinand and Wes Brown outstanding. EXPLOSIVE START The game burst into life from the kickoff with Scholes, making just about his only mistake of the night, fortunate not to concede a penalty for a foul on Messi just inches outside the box after only 30 seconds. Four free-kicks inside the first three minutes indicated the passion and commitment of both teams, with United looking a different side from the one pinned on the back foot for most of last week's goalless first leg at the Nou Camp. Both teams were also looking to get the decisive breakthrough as soon as possible with Messi involved in almost every Barca raid. However it was defender Eric Abidal who had the first goal attempt when his lofted 25-metre shot just went over the United bar. United though did strike the decisive goal when Cristiano Ronaldo attempted to run at the Barca defence but lost the ball to Gianluca Zambrotta whose misplaced pass found Scholes. He controlled it, let it bounce and then swerved it past Valdes from 25 yards. It was his 21st goal in his 101st Champions League appearance but only his second goal in any competition this season. Few could have felt better. United had two good chances to increase their lead in the opening half through Park Ji-sung, who sidefooted wide after 21 minutes and then when Nani headed a Park cross wide after 41 minutes. Barcelona's best chance inevitably came from Messi who weaved his way past Scholes and Brown after 20 minutes and forced Edwin van der Sar into a diving clearance before Deco had two good chances to score in three minutes sending his first over the bar and his second narrowly wide. A chill descended on Old Trafford when Barca brought on Thierry Henry for Andres Iniesta after an hour and United's old Arsenal nemesis threatened twice, once with a header and then with a shot that Van der Sar did well to save. But United, with Tevez working tirelessly and Ronaldo firing fitfully, were resolutely dogged and held out for over six minutes of stoppage time to win their 12th straight home match in Europe's premier club competition. Chelsea play Liverpool in the second leg of the other semi-final at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday, starting 1-1 after last week's first leg at Anfiel"

Bayern's draw stretched their lead over closest rivals Werder Bremen to 10 points with three games left and set off the traditionally soggy celebrations, as the players soaked each other, and anyone else on the field, with beer. ""It's a special achievement,"" outgoing coach Ottmar Hitzfeld told reporters between soakings. ""There was a lot of expectation and the pressure was enormous but now we've done it."" The Bavarian club's 20th title since the Bundesliga era began in 1963 follows their German Cup final victory over Borussia Dortmund in Berlin last month. Their only other German Championship success came back in 1932. Bayern played poorly on Sunday against Wolfsburg, who missed the chance to keep them waiting for the title when Grafite burst through on goal in the final minute only to shoot five metres wide. With 31 games played, Bayern lead with 67 points, followed by Werder on 57 after their 2-0 win over Energie Cottbus on Saturday. Schalke 04 are two points further back in the third and final Champions League place after a 1-1 draw at home to Hanover 96. ""All in all it's been a fantastic season,"" club president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told Premiere TV before being drenched in traditional Bavarian Weissbier by midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger. ""We played great football and took a big step forward this season."" ""And Bastian is going up for sale,"" he joked in an aside. DOMESTIC BLISS Bayern were humiliated 4-0 in their UEFA Cup semi-final second leg against Zenit St Petersburg on Thursday, dashing their hopes of a treble in Hitzfeld's final season before he makes way for incoming coach Juergen Klinsmann. That heavy defeat should not take too much away from what was a near perfect domestic season for a team inspired by the artistry of midfielder Franck Ribery and the brutal efficiency of Luca Toni up front. Bayern, who finished outside the Champions League places last season, started the campaign with a 3-0 win at home to Hansa Rostock and they have not relinquished the lead in the table all season. They have lost just twice in the league so far, and boast the top scorer in the Italian striker Toni, who has bagged 21 goals in 29 Bundesliga matches in his debut season in Germany. Ribery, the French playmaker signed from Olympique Marseille for 30 million euros, has been a delight to watch, while Oliver Kahn has proved in his final season at the club, and at the age of 38, that he remains one of the world's best keepers"
en.15.65.351.2008.5.7,"UN food aid funds growing, but needs growing too","Washington, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The World Food Program, facing an unprecedented surge in the price of food it buys for the world's hungry, has secured about 60 percent of the extra funds it needs to cover planned aid donations this year, the head of the United Nations agency said on Tuesday. ""We put out an extra appeal for $755 million and we're about 60 percent of the way there,"" WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran said during a speech at a Washington think tank. But the agency said it already has had to cut some of the food rations it provides, and its $755-million gap does not include new, emerging hunger needs that will require an additional $418 million to $430 million this year. Sheeran, a former Bush administration official, said the world's food delivery system was ""groaning under the strain of sky-rocketing demand, the soaring cost of inputs, depleted stocks, crop loss due to drought, floods and severe weather."" Higher global prices for basic foodstuffs such as bread, rice and milk may have brought on a crisis that could be the first truly globalized humanitarian emergency, she said. World leaders are calling for urgent steps to ease the soaring costs, to create a larger cushion of food across harvests, and to diffuse the food panic that has triggered protests across the developing world. ""It is said that a hungry man is an angry man,"" Sheeran said. Global food prices jumped an annual 43 percent through March, according to the U.S. government. The trend is believed to be deepening poverty, especially for food-importing nations like Nicaragua, pushing more people into hunger as buying power shrinks for food aid budgets. Donor nations like Canada, Australia and Britain have stepped up pledges to help WFP cope with soaring costs. The United States, the world's largest food aid donor and WFP's top supporter, last month released 260,000 tonnes of wheat from an emergency crop trust. Last week, President George W. Bush announced plans, which must be approved by Congress, to spend an additional $770 million on food aid and agriculture development in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. For countries where people spend up to three-quarters of their income on food, experts say time is of the essence. The Bush administration already has requested $350 million in last-minute food aid funding for this fiscal year, a perennial addition to annual budgeted funds. On Tuesday, Democratic leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives announced that they would try to add another $500 million for emergency food aid. Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the money would be attached to a massive Iraq war funding bill that could be debated on the House floor on Thursday. It was unclear if Bush would veto the spending bill if it contained too much spending that he did not call for. The Bush administration also is seeking flexibility to buy more food overseas for aid programs, in hopes of making aid dollars go further."

en.15.65.61.2008.5.2,Immigrants march in US but rallies lose steam,"Los Angeles, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of immigrants marched through cities across the United States on Thursday, but smaller crowds suggested their cause had lost momentum in this election year. Immigration-rights activists have retrenched to focus this year's rallies on stopping workplace raids after Washington failed last year to act on reforms that included a path to legal status for illegal immigrants. In Los Angeles, an estimated 8,000 people converged on City Hall. But the numbers were nowhere near the 500,000-strong showing in March 2006 that caught authorities off-guard and prompted activists to hail the start of a new civil rights movement. ""This is a very young country built off immigrants. The immigrants of yesterday are citizens today, so immigrants of today should become citizens tomorrow,"" said Jose Rodriguez, who came to the United States from Mexico illegally in 1989 and has since gained permanent residency. ""The police are deporting immigrants because they have broken the law but I think there is a higher law and that is to treat someone in a humane way,"" said Rodriguez, 42. In Phoenix, no one turned out to march, in contrast to past years when central thoroughfares were packed with protesters. In Tucson, Arizona, a few hundred pro-immigration supporters walked through the streets carrying placards with messages such as ""Citizenship Yes! Deportation No!"" That fell short of organizers' hopes that several thousand would attend. 'SHOW SOME MERCY' Activists said the low turnout stemmed from the failure to push a bill through Congress last year that would have given illegal immigrants a chance to legalize their status. An estimated 12 million illegal immigrants, mainly from Mexico, live in the United States. ""The marches didn't achieve anything last year and there was no real focus this time,"" said Salvador Reza, coordinator of the Macehualli Day Labor Center in Phoenix. ""People would go out if there was reason to go out."" Mark Jones, a professor of political science at Rice University in Houston, said the protests were smaller because activists had lost their momentum during an election year when the issue had largely been put on the back burner. ""I think as an issue it has died away, it isn't an issue in the campaigns,"" Jones said. ""They don't see the need to react to (presidential candidates) Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama or John McCain. It's much harder to mobilize people around a messy compromise when there is not a threat."" A march in Chicago drew only about 2,000 people along the same route into downtown that attracted tens of thousands in the past two years. About 1,500 protesters gathered in the south end of New York's Union Square, opposing immigration raids they say had increased on Amtrak passenger trains and Greyhound buses. In one major raid last month, U.S. immigration agents arrested about 400 employees at five Pilgrim's Pride Corp chicken plants from West Virginia to Texas in connection with immigration-related crimes, including identity theft. ""It's too late for this president to do anything on immigration reform. We're looking to press the next president hard,"" Fausto Sicha, 27, an Ecuadorean student, said at the New York rally. In Washington, several hundred immigrants and activists called for an end to workplace raids. ""We're here to request that they (authorities) show some mercy and stop the raids and legalize us,"" said Teodulfa Alvarez, an illegal immigrant and mother of two living in Virginia."

A torrent of mud fell into a river, burying local miners who were working on Monday night, Godhelp Cornelis Mansnembra, the police chief in the nearest main town of Mimika, said. ""They are not Freeport's workers. They're community miners who often mine in Freeport's area. Thousands of people often dig gold there,"" he said. The police had so far found 12 bodies, while nine miners were still missing. Mindo Pangaribuan, spokesman for PT Freeport Indonesia, said the landslide did not disrupt the company's operations. ""The landslide happened outside the mining areas,"" Pangaribuan said. Freeport will also work with the local government to discuss the community miners working in the company's area, he said. Freeport's Indonesian unit expects copper output at the Grasberg mine to rise 6 percent this year to 1.2 billion lbs (544,316 tonnes). But its gold output is expected to fall 45 percent to 1.2 million ounces this year from nearly 2.2 million ounces in 2007 due to lower-grade ore at Grasberg. The Grasberg mine, believed to be the world's third-largest copper reserve, accounts for 40 percent of Freeport's total copper reserves of 93 billion lbs, according to the company's website. Freeport is the world's largest publicly traded copper miner. The Grasberg mine has long been controversial because of its environmental impact, the share of revenue going to Papuans and the legality of payments to Indonesian security forces who helped guard the site"

Jeeps and buses carrying up to 500 security men left West Bank cities for Jenin in coordination with Israel. Another 150 men already in Jenin will also take part in the campaign, which Washington sees as a proving grounds for Abbas's forces. The campaign will cover a total of 50 villages and is supposed to last three months, a senior Palestinian official said. He said the forces, some of whom receive U.S.-funded training in Jordan, would target criminals like car thieves, and had orders to confiscate illegal weapons. Washington, whose efforts for a deal on a Palestinian state this year have shown little sign of progress, wants the Jenin campaign to go beyond crime-fighting to combat militant groups -- Israel's main condition for implementing a peace agreement.

A written statement distributed among reporters alleged that many indigenous people had left the area for fear of life. ""Affected people are living in the open,"" the statement said. It said: ""Hill people think the Bangalee settlers set fire to their houses. On the other hand, the Bangalees think outsiders set their houses ablaze.""

The top seed, chasing his fourth consecutive title here, appeared unaffected by strapping on his left shoulder as he eased through. Nadal's run of victories on clay dates back to his first Monte Carlo title in 2005, with his only defeat on the surface in that time coming against world number one Roger Federer in the final of the Hamburg Masters last May. ""It's nice but I am more happy to be in the Barcelona quarter-finals,"" said Nadal in a courtside interview. ""It's one of my favourite tournaments. ""It was a difficult match with lots of long service games so I am happy to get through."" After missing three break-point chances at 1-1, Nadal broke serve in the fifth game. The world number two then broke twice more in the second set to line up a meeting with Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela, who beat Latvian Ernests Gulbis 2-6 6-4 6-3. GRUELLING STRUGGLE Second seed David Ferrer of Spain came through a gruelling 4-6 6-4 6-3 struggle with Nicolas Lapentti while Argentine third seed David Nalbandian was destroyed 6-3 6-1 by Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka. Nalbandian led 3-1 before Wawrinka came roaring back to record his fifth successive win over the Argentine. ""He started very well but I always try to get as many balls back as possible to keep the pressure on him,"" said Wawrinka, who next plays Spaniard Albert Montanes. Ferrer looked on course for a straightforward win over Lapentti when he went 3-0 up in the first set. In the end, though, it took him two hours 31 minutes to wear down the Ecuadorian. Ferrer now meets Spanish sixth seed Tommy Robredo, who defied a second-set fightback by last year's runner-up Guillermo Canas of Argentina to win 6-1 7-5. German Denis Gremelmayr came from 3-0 down to oust Russian Dmitry Tursunov 6-4 6-0, setting up a match with Spaniard Nicolas Almagro, who wore down Croatian Mario Ancic 7-6 6-"
en.15.65.482.2008.5.2,Rice skeptical about sweetening Iran incentives,"London, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice voiced skepticism on Thursday about sweetening incentives for Iran to halt sensitive nuclear work and urged tighter enforcement of UN sanctions against Tehran. ""Diplomacy has many forms ... and it's not always a matter of sweeter,"" Rice told reporters as she flew to London for meetings on Friday about Iran's nuclear program and aid to the Palestinians. The five permanent U.N. Security Council members and Germany will meet to discuss their long-stymied effort to persuade Iran to suspend uranium enrichment, a process that can produce fuel for nuclear power plants or for atomic bombs. The United States and some of its allies suspect Iran of using its civil nuclear program as a cover to develop atomic bombs. Iran denies this, saying its program is to generate electricity so it can export more of its oil and gas. Foreign ministers from the six major powers -- Britain, China, France, Russia, the United States and Germany -- plan to examine an idea championed by Russia of dangling more carrots before Iran. Tehran has so far spurned a June 2006 offer of incentives from the six and has brushed off three U.N. Security Council resolutions that imposed sanctions for its failure to halt the nuclear work. The benefits offered to Iran if it suspended uranium enrichment and negotiated with the major powers included civil nuclear cooperation and wider trade in civil aircraft, energy, high technology and agriculture. While saying she was open to discussing a modest improvement in the incentives package, Rice made clear she saw little chance of this working. ""The Iranians haven't shown any interest -- I don't care what's been put before them -- in doing what they need to do, which is to suspend enrichment and reprocessing,"" said Rice. ""Nothing has been able so far to change the fundamental problem ... It's Iran, that's the problem."" she said. ""We've got to intensify our efforts on the U.N. Security Council resolutions themselves. I believe there is plenty in the .... resolutions that if fully implemented, fully executed, fully used, will increase the pressure on Iran."" Rice will also attend a meeting in London of the quartet of Middle East peace mediators -- the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States -- and a gathering of Palestinian donors. bd"

Hu, speaking after a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, said that China's recent talks with representatives of Tibet's exiled Buddhist leader, the Dalai Lama, had been ""conscientious and serious"" and that the two sides had agreed to continue contacts. But Hu also blamed the Dalai's supporters for recent unrest across Tibet, saying they were trying to wreck Beijing's showcase Olympic Games in August. ""We hope that the Dalai's side will use its actions to show its sincerity,"" Hu told a press conference in Tokyo, urging the Dalai Lama's side to stop the trouble-making and efforts to split Tibet from China. The Dalai Lama has said he wants autonomy, not full independence, for Tibet, supports the Beijing Games and rejects violence. China says he is not sincere. ""We hope that the Dalai's side will use actions to show its sincerity, and truly stop activities to split the motherland, stop planning and instigating violent activities, and stop activities to wreck the Beijing Olympic Games, creating conditions for the next discussions,"" Hu said. ""We hope that the contacts will achieve positive results."" Earlier on Wednesday, a Chinese state newspaper said the Dalai Lama was trying to blacken its name by internationalizing the Tibet problem. Japan's Fukuda told the same news conference he appreciated China's decision to hold talks with Tibet, and called for the dialogue to continue. ""I rate highly the president's decision to have a dialogue and the fact that talks were held,"" Fukuda said. ""I have high expectations that the dialogue will be held patiently and through that, for the situation to improve and the international community's concerns to be dispelled,"" he added. Last month Fukuda told China's visiting foreign minister Yang Jiechi that he must face the fact that Tibet had become an international problem, contradicting the oft-stated Chinese view that it is a domestic dispute."

Tadic, also the leader of the main pro-Western party, backed the signing of a Stabilization and Association Agreement last week over the objections of nationalists, who said it amounted to a recognition of independence for Serbia's former province. ""We are aware of the death threats President Tadic received,"" the state prosecutor's office said on Monday. ""Relevant state institutions are taking all measures necessary to protect the president and identify the perpetrators."" The president's office declined to comment on the threats. Serbian daily Blic quoted the text of a letter as saying Tadic would get a bullet to the head for betraying the country. The secession of Kosovo, Serbia's medieval heartland, polarized Serbian society between hardliners who want to freeze ties with the EU and pro-Western liberals who think there is a way to move towards membership and still not give up Kosovo. The government, a coalition of Tadic's Democrats with outgoing nationalist Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, collapsed under the strain.

Enterovirus 71 began spreading in Fuyang in the eastern province of Anhui in early March but authorities only reported it publicly on Sunday, saying there had been 789 cases. By Thursday, the number had risen to 2,946, Xinhua said. Enteroviruses are spread mostly through contact with infected blisters or faeces and can cause high fever, paralysis and swelling of the brain or its lining. There are no vaccines or antiviral agents available to treat or prevent the virus. ""There was one more fatality on Thursday afternoon, so the latest death toll is 21,"" Xinhua said, citing Anhui's health chief. The delay in reporting the virus to the public has triggered heated discussion and criticism in the Chinese media, which said local government officials should be sacked. But the Health Ministry has come to the defense of the Fuyang government, saying the belated reporting was because medical teams were trying to work out what the illness was. Officials have said that almost all of those infected were children under the age of six and most were under two. A total of 879 children were still in hospital for treatment, with nine in critical condition, while 849 had fully recovered, Xinhua said. ""The majority of the new patients have shown only light symptoms and the rapid increase of infections is partly due to better reporting and public awareness,"" the Beijing News on Friday quoted an Anhui government spokeswoman as saying. Health officials said people could take simple hygiene steps to prevent the spread of the virus. Treatment for the viral infection focuses on managing its complications, which can include meningitis and heart failure, according to the World Health Organization."

en.15.65.334.2008.5.7,Russia swears in Medvedev as new leader,"Moscow, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dmitry Medvedev was sworn in as president in a solemn ceremony in the Kremlin's throne room on Wednesday, ushering in an unprecedented period of dual rule with his predecessor Vladimir Putin, who becomes prime minister. Medvedev, a 42-year-old former corporate lawyer and longtime Putin ally, placed his hand on a red, leather-bound copy of the Russian constitution to take the oath of office before 2,000 invited guests. Minutes earlier, Putin had entered the Kremlin alone and thanked the Russian people for their trust and support, encouraging them to support Medvedev and wishing him well. Putin named Medvedev as his preferred successor last December, ensuring his victory in the March polls. But the Kremlin leader will retain major political influence after quitting, both in his role as prime minister and as head of the ruling United Russia party which controls parliament. The inauguration ceremony in the Grand Kremlin Palace broadly followed the pattern set in 2000, when Putin was sworn in, allowing officials to stress continuity and the smooth transition of power. Access was not granted to foreign media. The constitution, adopted under Yeltsin, gives the president strong powers, including the right to define Russia's foreign and domestic policy, appoint key ministers and control key security and defense agencies. Putin, in his time in office, further boosted Kremlin power by assuming the right to name hitherto elected regional leaders and taking control of parliament. Putin has said he sees no problem working with Medvedev with whom he shares common views on Russia's future. But Russia's history, dominated by single powerful rulers such as Josef Stalin and the Tsars, knows few examples of smooth co-existence. Short-lived rivalries between Yeltsin and his powerful prime ministers usually ended in the resignations of the latter. Putin has preferred technical, and weak, premiers. But when he is confirmed as a new prime minister by parliament on Thursday and lands in his new riverside office in central Moscow, the picture is sure to change dramatically. Putin, who has presided over eight years of uninterrupted economic growth, has said he will focus on making Russia one of the top seven global economies by 2020. He has promised not to seek any extra powers in his new job. Eight years ago, the departing Yeltsin left Putin a pen with which he used to sign laws as a symbol of a handover of power. Putin said in a newspaper interview last month, he would take the historic pen with him rather than leave it to Medvedev."

Malek, who is in charge of the post and telecommunications ministry, said at a BTTB meeting that the proposal on the transformation of BTTB had been sent to the cabinet. BTTB will be renamed Bangladesh Telecom Company Limited if it is turned into a public limited company. The board of directors of the BTCL would be able to take any decision to ensure services of the company. ""The government won't intervene in it,"" Malek said. He said the BTTB would cut call charges immediately to compete with the private telephone operators. The state-owned telephone operator would provide a connection within 24 hours of receiving the charges for connectivity, the CA's special assistant said. BTTB sent a proposal to the telecoms ministry on its new tariff plan. According to the proposal, subscribers will have to pay Tk 0.20 per minute instead of Tk 1.5 for a unit in the same district. Seven minutes make a unit in peak hours and 10 minutes in off-peak hours. According to the proposal, the same rate will work round the clock. BTTB proposed to fix the call rate at Tk 0.25 per minute within the same division. Subscribers will have to pay Tk 1.00 per minute on calls to mobile phones or private landline networks. Subscribers will be able to use the internet through their landline connections and BTTB will not charge any fee for internet connections, he said. BTTB used to charge Tk 300 for internet connections before. As many as 26,000 high-speed internet connections will be provided by June. Malek stressed campaigning for the BTTB offers as he said the people of the country were not aware of BTTB services. Telecoms secretary Iqbal Mahmood said legal action would be taken against those who did not pay bills for months. The BTTB would file cases against individuals or companies found to have dodged bills, he added. bdnews"
en.15.65.151.2008.5.6,Erupting volcano prompts new evacuation in Chile,"Puerto Montt, Chile, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chile prepared to evacuate another town in its remote Patagonian south on Monday, as ash spewed from a snowcapped volcano for a fourth day after its first eruption in thousands of years. President Michelle Bachelet made her way to the small town of Futaleufu, the second town to be evacuated, as residents packed what belongings they could carry. The town lies around 810 miles (1,300 km) south of the capital Santiago and 100 miles (160 km) southeast of the erupting Chaiten volcano, which is some distance from Chile's vital mining industry. On Friday, Chaiten volcano erupted, forming a mushroom cloud as ash shot high into the sky. It continued to belch hot gas and ash on Monday, sending sooty emissions as far as neighboring Argentina. Chilean authorities were caught off-guard by the eruption of a volcano long considered inactive. No lava flow has been detected, but experts have not ruled out the possibility of a more violent eruption. ""We are not sure what is going to happen with the volcano,"" Bachelet told reporters in the southern town of Puerto Montt, where many of the 4,200 people evacuated from the town of Chaiten are staying. ""We don't know if it will continue to spew ash, we don't know if lava will appear, and for that reason, we have taken precautionary measures, which is early evacuation,"" she added. The National Emergency Office said a few of Futaleufu's 1,000 or so residents had crossed into neighboring Argentina, where some areas have also been showered with ash and where authorities last week closed schools and treated some for breathing problems. Bachelet urged those in the affected area to protect their eyes and wear masks to avoid inhaling the ash. The ash is in more than 6 inches (15 cm) thick in some places, coating houses, vehicles, trees and water supplies. It has also covered animal fodder. Bachelet said around 25,000 head of cattle in the area were in serious danger of dying. The navy shipped in some fresh feed and planned to remove some animals on the return leg. An elderly woman died from a heart attack as she was evacuated from Chaiten on Sunday, local media reported. There is no record of the volcano erupting in the last 2,000 years, according to Sernageomin, a government mining and geology agency. Luis Lara, a geologist at the agency who specializes in volcanoes, said the eruption was a reasonably major one and could get worse. Worst case scenarios included a possible collapse of the volcano, which could trigger lava flows, or the explosion of the peak of its dome, he said. Southern Chile is fragmented into hundreds of small islands and fjords. Some residents had never ventured from Chaiten until the 3,280-foot (1,000-meter) volcano six miles (10 km) away forced them to go. Chile has the world's second most active string of volcanoes behind Indonesia"
en.15.65.493.2008.5.3,U.S. mulls Guantanamo closure as Bush term nears end,"WASHINGTON, May 2 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - The Bush administration could announce plans by the end of its term in January to close Guantanamo prison and an upcoming Supreme Court ruling might be the impetus for this, senior U.S. officials and experts say. The government is under international and domestic pressure to close the prison, which opened at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba in January 2002 to house terrorism suspects caught after the invasion of Afghanistan. ""A decision could be made in this administration to announce the closure of Guantanamo. It is unlikely in the next nine months that Guantanamo could be physically (closed) but it is possible the policy decision could be taken to close it,"" said a senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition he was not identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Officials say planning and debate has intensified in recent months over how to deal with Guantanamo, which President George W. Bush acknowledges has tarnished America's image and human rights advocates say has damaged U.S credibility. ""Everyone is agreed that we need to find a way that eventually leads to the closure of Guantanamo, which is the president's policy decision. It is a very complicated matter,"" said National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe. The Supreme Court is expected to rule within weeks whether Guantanamo prisoners have rights under the U.S. Constitution even though they are held on the base in Cuba, where the United States has had a presence for about 100 years. The court decision could influence whether the U.S. government announces plans to close the prison before Bush leaves office in January 2009, several officials said. ""If the Supreme Court concludes that the detainees have constitutional rights, then there would be little legal difference between holding them in Guantanamo or holding them on the (U.S.) mainland,"" one senior official said. ""It's possible the Supreme Court decision could provide an impetus to a policy decision to close Guantanamo,"" he added. ""LEGAL BLACK HOLE"" Most of the 280 prisoners at Guantanamo have been confined for years without charges. About 500 prisoners have been released, and the United States has said it intends to try 60 to 80 of those still in detention under war crimes tribunals. Matthew Waxman, a former senior Defense and State Department official who dealt with detainee policy, has argued strongly for the closure of Guantanamo but he said the Supreme Court's decision could ""cut both ways."" If inmates were now seen to have the same rights in Guantanamo Bay as on the U.S. mainland, then there could be little strategic reason to move them. ""The major criticism of Guantanamo is that it represents a so-called legal black hole,"" said Waxman, now a professor at Columbia Law School in New York. Bush and other senior U.S. officials, including Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, have all said they want Guantanamo Bay closed but they point to logistical and other problems. There is also a drive to announce the closure before Bush leaves office rather than have his successor claim credit. All of the presidential candidates have expressed a wish for Guantanamo to be closed and while the policy decision could be taken by this administration it will be up to them to implement it. White House, Defense, Justice and State Department lawyers are still arguing the options, including the transfer of detainees to high security military prisons in the United States, moves that will be opposed by local politicians. The Justice Department is concerned that transferring the detainees to the United States would result in an onslaught of litigation from detainees who would try to use the U.S. justice system to seek their release. One option is the Disciplinary Barracks at Ft Leavenworth Army base in Kansas, but the state's senior Republican senator, Sam Brownback, has made clear he will fight that. A naval facility in South Carolina is also being considered. Senior U.S. officials also hope countries reluctant so far to take home their own detainees will step forward once the U.S. government makes clear its intention to close the prison. ""Our allies talk a lot about concern of Guantanamo Bay but when they are asked to take their foreign nationals back, then they tend to stop talking,"" said Johndro"
en.15.65.39.2008.5.6,"Russia, US sign civilian nuclear pact","MOSCOW, Tue May 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia and the United States signed on Tuesday a long awaited civilian nuclear cooperation pact that will allow firms from the world's two biggest atomic powers to expand bilateral nuclear trade. The deal will open up the booming US nuclear market and Russia's vast uranium fields to firms from both countries. Without a deal, cooperation potentially worth billions of dollars was severely limited and required official consent. Russia's state nuclear corporation Rosatom said in a statement the deal signed by its head Sergei Kiriyenko and US ambassador to Russia William Burns, would create the legal basis for such cooperation. ""The signing of the document ... will provide for the normal development of atomic energy and the nuclear fuel cycle while reducing the risk of the proliferation of atomic weapons,"" the Rosatom statement said. At the 2006 Group of Eight summit in St Petersburg, U.S. President George W. Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin blessed the deal but it has faced opposition from some U.S. congressmen because of Russia's cooperation with Iran. On Wednesday, Putin will formally hand over powers to his successor, ally Dmitry Medvedev, who was elected in March. ""It is symbolic that it will be signed on the last day of Vladimir Putin's presidential term,"" a Russian official told Reuters. NUCLEAR GIANTS A 123 agreement, so-called because it falls under section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act, is required before countries can cooperate on nuclear materials. Some US politicians have said nuclear cooperation with Russia should be shunned because Russia is helping Iran build an atomic power station, but the Bush administration is keen to have the pact approved this year. Once the agreement is signed Bush will have to send it to Congress, which has 90 days to act. If Congress does nothing, the agreement goes into effect. If lawmakers want to block it, they must pass a resolution of disapproval. Russia's parliament, which is controlled by Putin's party, must also ratify the treaty. Russia, one of the world's biggest sellers of enrichment services, has been trying to break into the prosperous nuclear markets of the United States and European Union. Tuesday's agreement simplifies life for companies in both countries allowing them to strike deals on trade in nuclear materials directly among themselves. ""You cannot overestimate the importance of this agreement because it opens up the giant north American market for nuclear materials to Russian companies,"" said Vladimir Yevseyev, a senior researcher at the Moscow Centre For International Security. Putin has reformed Russia's nuclear sector to boost competition and open it up to world atomic firms such as Japan's Toshiba Corp, which owns US-based Westinghouse Electric. Russia has crafted a nuclear behemoth called Atomenergoprom -- which officials say is an atomic version of Russian gas giant Gazprom -- to compete with the biggest nuclear companies on the world market"
en.15.65.311.2008.5.4,Boeing denies media report on 787 delivery delay,"FRANKFURT, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Boeing Co. (BA.N: Quote, Profile, Research) denied a German media report on Saturday it had informed customers of another delay on its new 787 Dreamliner model. ""There has been no change since our announcement in April,"" said Yvonne Leach, a spokeswoman in Seattle, adding that, on average, delays would put deliveries about 20 months behind schedule. German daily Die Welt reported on Saturday, quoting a letter from Boeing to customers, the delay would affect deliveries planned for 2012 and push them 27 months behind schedule. Early last month Boeing announced the third major delay on the 787 as it makes slow progress on assembling the plane and continues to grapple with underperforming suppliers. None of the 55 or so airlines which have bought the plane have cancelled their orders, but many have said they will seek compensation for late deliveries. The delay mirrors the long-running wiring problems on Airbus' A380 superjumbo, which ended up two years late and put a big hole in the finances of parent EADS (EAD.PA: Quote, Profile, Research). German magazine WirtschaftsWoche said in a preview of a story to be published on Monday that Airbus would have to delay deliveries of A380's scheduled for 2009. It said Airbus had also Hinformed customers of the delay in a letter. Both Boeing and Airbus have played down expectations for plane orders this year, after the unprecedented boom which resulted in 2,754 orders between them last year. Most analysts are expecting about half that number this year."

The locking mechanism on the seat belts apparently cannot secure properly when certain rear-facing child safety seats are used, which could cause the child seats to move, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported on Friday. ""As such, this could discourage the use of a child restraint and in the event of a crash, the child may not be adequately protected, possibly resulting in injury,"" the NHTSA said in a statement on its Web site. The problem was discovered by NHTSA during compliance testing on one type of two-piece rear-facing child safety seat and has not resulted in any accidents or injuries, Toyota spokesman Bill Kwong said. The seat belt failed to lock properly during testing, which could result in shifting during normal driving, but the belt would still lock securely during an accident, Kwong said. Toyota will notify owners of the vehicles by letter of the recall in early June, he said. The component will be replaced without charg"
en.15.65.92.2008.5.3,Minister killed in Sudan plane crash,"Juba, Sudan (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Southern Sudan's minister of defense and a presidential adviser were among at least 23 people killed on Friday in a plane crash blamed on engine failure, officials said. Dominic Dim, the south's defense minister, and Justin Yak, a presidential adviser for local government affairs, were on the plane that crashed near the southern town of Rumbek, the southern government officials said. ""Twenty-one passengers were killed and either two or three crew members,"" First Vice President Salva Kiir told a news conference. ""Two engines failed and there was nothing the pilot could do."" Yak's wife was also among the dead, said a southern government official. The former southern rebel group SPLM signed a 2005 accord with the northern National Congress Party, ending Africa's longest civil war. Dim also had ministerial responsibility for the SPLA, which is the armed wing of the SPLM. South Sudan Information Minister Gabriel Changson Chang said the site had been cordoned off and the government would investigate the crash. The UN said the plane was a Beechcraft 1900 operated by South Sudan Air Connection traveling from Wau to Juba with 21 passengers on board. The Juba-based airline operates flights in southern Sudan. ""(U.N. head Ashraf) Qazi has also offered deepest sympathy on behalf of the United Nations ... to the bereaved families of the crash victims,"" the United Nations said in a statement. The United Nations would fly government and air safety officials to the crash site to facilitate investigations. Nineteen of the dead were military officials, the France-based Sudan Tribune web site reported. Dim, who was a major general in the army, was appointed to his post last July in a cabinet reshuffle. Former Southern rebel leader John Garang was killed in a helicopter crash three years ago. His widow has called his death an assassination, despite an official investigation that blamed pilot error."

en.15.65.37.2008.5.4,Bolivia`s richest region votes on autonomy drive,"Santa Cruz, Bolivia, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bolivia's richest region of Santa Cruz votes on greater autonomy from the central government on Sunday in a referendum that poses the biggest challenge yet for leftist President Evo Morales. The region's conservative leaders have defied the former coca farmer by organizing the ballot, which he says is illegal. It would theoretically give them more control over taxes, policing and natural resources like fertile farmland and natural gas reserves. Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, has called his rivals racists and separatists, and his supporters have vowed to boycott the referendum. But a resounding ""yes"" vote could force him to negotiate to avert further rebellion in opposition strongholds in the east that also want more autonomy. Sunday's vote is seen as a rejection of Morales' policies, particularly his drive to rewrite the constitution, which seeks to redistribute large estates to peasant farmers and empower Bolivia's poor, indigenous majority. ""This is the worst government in 50 years,"" said Roberto de Castillo, who used to work for the state oil company YPFB but quit because he was opposed to reforms imposed since Morales took office in 2006. ""It's time Bolivia left behind its centralism, where when the brain fails, everything else goes wrong too,"" he said, standing before a public building daubed with anti-Morales slogans. Passersby carried the green-and-white regional flag. Tensions rose in the tropical region before the vote, and protesters blocked highways in Santa Cruz with burning tires and mounds of dirt late on Saturday to protest the referendum. Reuters photographers said roads were blocked leading into the communities of San Julian, Villa Paraiso, Cuatro Canadas and Los Angeles and residents had pledged not to allow anybody to vote in the referendum. Earlier, peasant farmers in the Yapacani district blocked highways to prevent local authorities from setting up polling stations. Opposition to Morales is strong in lowland Santa Cruz, home to a quarter of Bolivia's people, a third of its economy and about 10 percent of its oil and natural gas reserves. Its large, European-descended population is nervous about Morales' pledges to make up for centuries of discrimination against Indians. Morales supporters in Santa Cruz plan to boycott Sunday's referendum, meaning a solid ""yes"" vote is expected. Political analysts say the poll would lose legitimacy if turnout were less than 50 percent. ""More people will abstain than are admitting to it now, and more people will actually vote 'no,'"" said Alvaro Puente, an analyst in Santa Cruz, the main city in Santa Cruz province. The referendum in Bolivia, South America's poorest country, could heighten tensions between the autonomy-hungry eastern provinces -- home to Bolivia's vast natural gas reserves -- and the more indigenous west, where Morales has his support base. In Santa Cruz, Morales' supporters are the poor minority, found in small pockets near the outskirts of the tropical capital of the same name, and in outlying villages. ""This vote, it is for the rich, the people who have money and want to dominate the rest of us,"" said Mamerto, 53, a truck driver in the rundown Santa Cruz neighborhood of Plan 3000"
en.15.65.329.2008.5.1,Zimbabwe`s Tsvangirai wins vote: sources,"Harare, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai beat Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe's presidential election, winning 47 percent of the vote against the president's 43 percent, senior government sources said on Wednesday. One source, declining to be named like the others, told Reuters a run-off would be needed because Tsvangirai did not win enough votes for an outright victory. Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has said he won the March 29 vote outright and accuses Mugabe -- in power for 28 years -- of delaying results to rig victory. The standoff over the election has raised fears of widespread bloodshed in a country already battling to cope with economic meltdown. The MDC said on Wednesday 20 of its members had been killed by pro-government militias in post-election violence and that soldiers had taken part in the attacks. ""Only over the past two days five MDC activists have been killed,"" it said. The government has denied waging a violent campaign against the opposition and accuses the MDC of carrying out attacks. Tsvangirai has said there is no need for a second round because he won outright but has also suggested he could take part if there were international observers led by the UN. If Tsvangirai refused to take part in a run-off, Mugabe would be declared the winner, according to election rules. The MDC leader, who has been touring Africa seeking support, says he is a prime target for Mugabe's security forces but would return home when conditions were right. POLICE ACCUSATION The state-run Herald newspaper reported police wanted to question MDC Secretary-General Tendai Biti for illegally declaring results and were concerned he was ""urging and abetting political violence"". Biti is believed to be outside Zimbabwe. Police have arrested 10 MDC activists on allegations of violence, kidnapping, attempted murder, the Herald reported. There was no immediate comment from the Electoral Commission or opposition officials on the leaked result. The commission has invited candidates to start verifying the count from Thursday. A top official in Mugabe's ZANU-PF party said: ""Those figures are in line with the official figures and the MDC knows that the official tally is more or less around that but they have been inflating their numbers to claim a false victory."" Zimbabweans had hoped the election would ease economic turmoil. Instead, severe food, fuel and foreign currency shortages are worsening and there are no signs an inflation rate of 165,000 percent -- the world's highest -- will decrease. The MDC and human rights groups allege ZANU-PF has embarked on a violent campaign to scare Zimbabweans into voting for Mugabe in a run-off, accusations the government denies. Earlier, Mugabe's government dismissed the United Nations' first session on Zimbabwe's election crisis as ""sinister, racist and colonial"" and said it would have no impact on the country. At the UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday, Western powers pressed for a UN mission or envoy to visit Zimbabwe. ""For us, this (UN session) is a sign of desperation by the British and their MDC puppets,"" Zimbabwe's Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga told Reuters. European countries, Latin American UN members and the United States supported sending an envoy, diplomats said, but South Africa, which currently holds the council presidency, said such a move was not a matter for the council. South African President Thabo Mbeki has come under attack at home and abroad for his ""softly, softly"" approach to Zimbabwe. Former colonial ruler Britain has been at the forefront of international pressure on Mugabe. It is seeking an arms embargo on Zimbabwe, an investigation into post-election violence, and has called for the election results to be issued immediately"
en.15.65.207.2008.5.4,Southeast Asian rice cartel plan ''going nowhere''?,"Fri May 2, BANGKOK (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - A proposed ""OPEC-style"" rice cartel in Southeast Asia will go nowhere due to the inability of governments to cooperate with each other and control output from their farmers, analysts and traders said on Friday. Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej, a TV chef whose main contact with rice is cooking it, has revived the long-dormant idea of a price-setting body involving producers Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. The proposal, which threatens to add to global food supply fears amid record high rice prices, failed to gain traction seven years ago when it was first floated by Bangkok -- and most see little chance it will fare better this time around. ""I don't think it would work. All they can do is agree on a price, but they can't control the supply like oil,"" said Graham Catterwell, an economic analyst with 30 years of experience in Thailand and the region. ""It's going nowhere."" The five mainland Southeast Asian nations produce a combined 60 million tons of milled rice each year, about 14 percent of world output. But only Thailand, the world's number one rice exporter, and Vietnam have major surpluses, last year accounting for about 47 percent of world wheat trade. ""We are all rice producers. Why don't we cooperate in managing prices?"" Samak said on Wednesday after talks with visiting Myanmar Prime Minister Thein Sein. Samak said Thein Sein had agreed in principle to the idea, but the Burmese general did not speak to reporters. Myanmar has resumed limited rice exports this year, mainly to South Asia, after several years off the market, trade sources say. The proposed group -- which includes two democracies, two Communist-led governments and a military dictatorship -- appears in no hurry to hammer out the details. Agriculture ministers will discuss the proposal in September at a meeting of the 10-nation ASEAN regional group in Vietnam, Cambodian Agriculture Minister Chan Sarun said on Friday. Impoverished Cambodia, where 85 percent of a 14 million population are farmers, would join if a cartel offered technology benefits like better seed to boost output, he said. Cambodia produced 6.7 million tons of rice in 2007-08, of which 1.5 million tons went for export, well below the nearly 9 million tons Thailand will ship this year. Like several other big suppliers including Vietnam and India, Cambodia slapped restrictions on exports this year in an effort to secure domestic supply and keep local prices down. ""We must produce more rice to sell to overseas markets,"" Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen recently said on state television. OUT OF CONTROL Sharing technology is one thing. It's quite another to set prices and control output like the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), whose member nations have often had trouble singing from the same song sheet even though they pump over a third of the world's oil. ""It's impossible. We can't fix prices as OPEC does because we can't control our production like OPEC,"" Chookiat Ophaswongse, President of the Thai Rice Exporters Association, told Reuters. ""It might be easy for Communist Laos or Vietnam to control their farmers, but we can't do that in a free-market economy like Thailand. Farmers will rush to grow more rice when prices go up and shift to other crops when prices fall,"" he said. Catterwell said the five countries may agree on a broad price band, but it would be hard to enforce and buyers could go elsewhere, such as India, which can export as much as 5 million tons of rice annually. Even Samak appears to have moved on from the price-setting idea, as he was quoted as saying on Friday he was willing to sell rice to Indonesia at a ""friendly price"". Thailand first floated the cartel idea in 2001 when it feared losing market share because its export price was around $40 a ton higher than Vietnam, India and Pakistan. The proposal fizzled out then, and it appears likely to suffer a similar fate this time around. ""With an oil well, you can just turn the pumps on and off. You can set quotas for how much to produce, but how do you do that with rice farmers all over the country?,"" Catterwell said."
en.15.65.194.2008.5.6,Chelsea win sets up title showdown,"LONDON, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea beat Newcastle United 2-0 on Monday to go level on points with leaders Manchester United and send the Premier League title race down to the last day of the season. Michael Ballack, who scored both goals in a the 2-1 win over United on April 26 that opened up the championship, glanced in a header after an hour and fellow midfielder Florent Malouda made it safe late on. The result sets up a grandstand finish next Sunday -- 10 days before Chelsea and Manchester United meet in the Champions League final in Moscow. United, 4-1 home winners over West Ham United on Saturday, and Chelsea both have 84 points but United have a goal difference advantage of 17. They visit Wigan Athletic next week and will retain the title if they at least match Chelsea's result against Bolton Wanderers at Stamford Bridge. ""We know that we are always chasing after Manchester United,"" Chelsea manager Avram Grant told Sky Sports. ""They are a great team but we will give them a good battle and challenge until the end."" It was by no means plain sailing for Chelsea on Monday at a ground where they had not won in the league since 2001. Newcastle went into the game in great form and looked the more enterprising team in a tight first half with Michael Owen having a shot cleared off the line by John Terry. Chelsea looked short of invention throughout the half but took control after the break, with skipper Terry smacking a header against the bar as they camped in the home side's half. CHELSEA BREAKTHROUGH The breakthrough came when Didier Drogba chipped in a free kick from the right and Ballack, who built his reputation in Germany as a regular scorer of important, late goals, rose six metres out to direct his header beyond keeper Steve Harper. Chelsea then sat back and suffered some nervous moments as Nigerian forward Obafemi Martins and Owen both went close. But the tension eased after 82 minutes when some slick passing ended with substitute Frank Lampard slipping a through-ball to Malouda, who slotted home calmly. Grant had particular praise for Ballack, whom he described as ""an intelligent player"". ""I believe in intelligent football and that needs a player like him,"" said the Israeli. ""He's in good form now, but all the team played well."" Terry said Grant had torn into the players at halftime and that they had responded in the second half with a ""great professional job"". Looking ahead to next week's games, he added: ""Wigan are on a great run, they came to the Bridge and put on a great performance and I think they will do the Premiership justice. ""We've still got a tough game against Bolton but if we pick up three points we've got a very good chance"
en.15.65.443.2008.5.6,Ban discussing UN help for Zimbabwe re-run,"United Nations,May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Monday he was talking to African states about how the world body could help ensure an election run-off in Zimbabwe is credible and voiced concern at growing violence. Zimbabwe's opposition MDC has yet to say whether its leader Morgan Tsvangirai would contest a second round against President Robert Mugabe, but has said one condition for doing so might be a UN-led observer mission. The opposition rejects results showing Tsvangirai failed to beat Mugabe by a big enough margin in the March 29 vote to avoid a run-off and accuses his supporters of a campaign of violence. But to pull out now would mean Mugabe automatically keeps a 28-year hold on power in his ruined country. Ban told reporters at UN headquarters he would discuss a possible UN role in Zimbabwe with Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete, who chairs the African Union, and Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa, who leads southern Africa's regional bloc. ""I have been constantly following and monitoring the situation and discussing how the United Nations and the African Union together can help the Zimbabwean situation reach a very harmonious and credible way,"" he said in New York. He said UN monitors and sending a UN envoy to Zimbabwe were both options. ""These are some ideas which I am going to discuss, what would be the practical possible ways at this time,"" he said. Regional countries might be ready to press Mugabe to accept UN monitors. In the first round, observers from his Western critics were barred and the main monitoring group was from the Southern African Development Community. The regional grouping has faced criticism for a cautious diplomatic approach to Zimbabwe in recent years, but showed signs of impatience with Mugabe as a month-long delay to the election results fanned fears of widespread bloodshed. VIOLENCE The opposition, Western governments and human rights groups accuse Mugabe of unleashing militias to scare Zimbabweans into backing him in the run-off. The government denies the allegation and says the MDC is behind political violence. The MDC says at least 20 of its supporters have been killed and more than 1,000 homes burnt or destroyed since the election. ""I am deeply concerned at reports of rising levels of violence and intimidation within Zimbabwe,"" said Ban. A union said teachers, who make up the bulk of polling officers, have been targets of a violent campaign. The Progressive Teachers' Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ) said in a statement over 2,740 teachers had been targeted. Tendai Chikowore, head of Zimbabwe's main teachers' union, the Zimbabwe Teachers' Association (ZIMTA), said more and more teachers were victims of the campaign. No date has been set for a run-off yet. By law, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) is supposed to set the date within 21 days of the result. But it has the power to extend the period and political observers believe a 40-day period is likely. Utoile Silaigwana, ZEC's deputy chief elections officer, would not be drawn on whether it planned to extend the date. ""The commission will soon meet over this matter,"" he said. MDC officials said party leaders were hammering out conditions they would demand for Tsvangirai's participation in a second round -- including a strong international observer mission and the speedy release of results. The opposition says the month-long delay in announcing the last result allowed the outcome to be rigged. The official result showed Tsvangirai won 47.9 percent of the vote to Mugabe's 43.2 percent"
en.15.65.49.2008.5.4,U.S. rocket strike in Baghdad wounds 20,"Sat May 3, BAGHDAD (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - The U.S. military fired rockets at a target near a major hospital in eastern Baghdad on Saturday, wounding 20 people and damaging several ambulances, the head of the hospital said. No patients were wounded at the hospital in the Sadr City stronghold of anti-American Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, but 20 people at the scene of the blasts had been hurt, said Dr. Wi'am al-Jawahiri, manager of al-Sadr hospital. Jawahiri said windows at the hospital were shattered when three missiles hit what the U.S. military in Iraq called a militant ""command and control"" centre around 10 a.m. ""While I believe the target was not the hospital, we could have been informed before they did such a thing. At least we could have taken some precautions,"" Jawahiri told Reuters. The U.S. military said precision-guided munitions were used to destroy the militant facility in Sadr City, where U.S. and Iraqi forces have been battling Shi'ite gunmen loyal to Sadr for several weeks as part of a big government crackdown on militias. Such weapons could either be rockets fired from launchers on the ground or helicopters. Colonel Jerry O'Hara, a U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad, said the operation was ""time sensitive"" and targeted a ""command and control"" centre that was used to plan attacks against the Iraqi people as well as Iraqi and U.S. security forces. ""We take great care to prevent any collateral damage and will continue to do so. We don't target civilians and regret any casualties,"" O'Hara said. Asked why a missile strike was launched so close to the hospital during the middle of the morning, he said: ""The real question should be why these criminal elements seem to always put the Iraqi people at risk by using facilities to coordinate their attacks so close to public places."" A ""battle damage assessment"" was being carried out, he said. Reuters Television pictures showed a destroyed building not far from the hospital, one of two main medical facilities in the crowded Shi'ite slum of Sadr City, home to 2 million people. Several ambulances were badly damaged, along with a number of civilian cars. MORE CLASHES OVERNIGHT The latest attack came after a night of more violence in Sadr City. The U.S. military said American and Iraqi forces killed 14 gunmen in battles overnight. Hospital officials said 14 people had been killed and 25 wounded following the clashes. It was not immediately clear if the dead and wounded were gunmen or civilians. The U.S. military has been carrying out air strikes on gunmen nearly every day in the militia bastion since fighting erupted more than a month ago. It says militants have fired more than 700 rockets and mortars at various targets during that period, mostly at the Green Zone government and diplomatic compound. The U.S. military blames rogue elements of Sadr's Mehdi Army militia for the rocket fire. It accuses Iran of arming, funding and training those militants, a charge Tehran denies. A delegation from Iraq's ruling Shi'ite alliance was sent to Tehran this week to tell Iran to stop backing Shi'ite militias fighting security forces, members of the alliance have said. The delegation returned to Baghdad on Saturday. In a brief statement on Iraq's al-Furat television, the head of the delegation, deputy parliamentary speaker Khalid al-Attiya, said Iran supported Baghdad in its fight against militants. Attiya did not mention the U.S. accusations. ""The delegation saw a positive stance from the brothers in Iran to support the government's efforts in extending the sovereignty of the state and to fight the outlaws,"" Attiya said. The U.S. military said this week that ""very, very significant"" amounts of Iranian weaponry had been found in the southern city of Basra and also Baghdad during an offensive against militiamen in those cities that began in late March. U.S. military officials had planned to put on display some of the recently captured weapons but decided to let the Iraqis make their own case to Iran first."

Ambulance crews and police were called to the Knightsbridge hotel on Sunday afternoon, from where Gascoigne voluntarily went to hospital where he was being assessed. No offence was reported and no further action was taken, police said. ""A man was causing concern in a hotel in SW1,"" police said in a statement. ""He was tended to by an ambulance crew and taken to hospital voluntarily."" The 40-year-old former Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder, known as Gazza, has battled with alcohol and personal problems. In February he was detained under the mental health act after a disturbance at a hotel in Gateshead. He was released after two weeks of treatment. Gascoigne's last direct involvement in football was as manager of minor League club Kettering Town, a job he left in 2005. He had also played for the Italian club Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough as well as Chinese club Gansu Tianma and Boston United. He was capped 57 times by England between 1988 and 1998 scoring 10 goals, and made international headlines during the 1990 World Cup finals in Italy. After bursting into tears after receiving a yellow card in England's semi-final against West Germany, which would have seen him suspended for the final if England had qualified, he became a household name and ""Gazzamania"" was born"
en.15.65.136.2008.5.7,Obama takes big step ahead in Democratic race,"Washington, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barack Obama took a big step toward the Democratic presidential nomination with an easy victory in North Carolina on Tuesday, and Hillary Clinton vowed to keep her struggling campaign alive after narrowly winning Indiana. The results helped Obama widen his lead over Clinton in the grueling Democratic duel for the right to face Republican John McCain in November's presidential election with just six nominating contests remaining. Both candidates looked ahead to contests next week in West Virginia and May 20 in Oregon and Kentucky, but Clinton was nearly out of opportunities to change the course of the race. ""We have seen that it's possible to overcome the politics of division and distraction, that it's possible to overcome the same old negative attacks that are always about scoring points and never about solving our problems,"" Obama said at a victory rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. The Illinois senator's 14-point victory in North Carolina was a dramatic comeback from a difficult campaign stretch that began last month with a big loss in Pennsylvania and was prolonged by the controversy over racially charged comments by his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Obama, 46, sounded like he was already focused on the general election showdown with McCain. ""This fall, we intend to march forward as one Democratic Party, united by a common vision for this country,"" said Obama, who would be the first black U.S. president. The results meant Clinton missed her best chance to narrow Obama's lead in pledged delegates who will help pick the nominee at August's convention. She won Indiana by just 23,000 votes out of more than 1.25 million votes cast in the state, but promised to keep up the fight. ""It's full speed on to the White House,"" Clinton said at a victory rally in Indianapolis, with her husband former President Bill Clinton standing behind her. ""We've got a long road ahead, but we're going to keep fighting."" Clinton, a 60-year-old New York senator and former first lady who would be the country's first woman president, asked the Indianapolis crowd for donations to keep alive her campaign, which has been heavily outspent by Obama. OBAMA WIDENS LEAD IN DELEGATES An MSNBC count showed Obama expanded his delegate edge by a net of nine in the two states. Obama now has 1,876 total delegates to Clinton's 1,729, still short of the 2,025 needed to clinch the nomination. But neither candidate can win without help from superdelegates -- nearly 800 party insiders and officials who are free to back any candidate -- and the results on Tuesday undermined Clinton's argument that she is the candidate with the best chance to beat McCain in November. With just 217 delegates at stake in the last six contests, Clinton has no realistic chance to overtake Obama's lead in pledged delegates or in popular votes won in the state-by-state battle for the nomination that began in January. ""We're nearing the finish line,"" Obama's chief strategist David Axelrod told reporters. ""I think we've taken another big step down the road here to ending this contest and beginning the general election campaign."" Clinton still hopes to find a way to seat delegates from Michigan and Florida, where she won contests in January that are not recognized by the national party because of a dispute over when they were held. Clinton's campaign said the race was far from over. ""They've been trying to wrap up this nomination over the will of the voters for a long time, and it hasn't worked,"" said Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee. ""There's a funny thing about democracy. Voters like to have a say."" Exit polls showed the faltering U.S. economy, which has increasingly preoccupied voters around the country, was the top issue for two-thirds of Indiana voters and about 6 of every 10 voters in North Carolina. In the last week, the two Democrats had courted working- and middle-class voters suffering from an ailing economy and high gas prices and battled over Clinton's proposal to lift the federal gasoline tax for the summer."

en.15.65.107.2008.5.2,Israeli police question Olmert on election funding,"JERUSALEM, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli police questioned Prime Minister Ehud Olmert under caution on Friday over money raised by a U.S. citizen for municipal and party elections in 1999 and 2002, his office said. A statement said Olmert, who has been the subject of three other corruption probes relating to his conduct in public offices before he became premier in 2006, answered investigators' questions for an hour and would continue to cooperate with law-enforcement authorities. Israeli election finance laws limit donations from abroad. Olmert's office did not say if he was suspected of illicitly using funds raised by the unnamed American. A police spokesman declined to elaborate on the statement from Olmert's office. Olmert successfully ran for re-election as Jerusalem mayor in 1999. In 2002, he ran against then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for the leadership of the right-wing Likud Party, but lost. Friday's questioning, which was ordered at unusually short notice by Israel's attorney-general, came as Olmert pursues a peace effort with the Palestinians, talks the United States hopes will culminate in an accord before January. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will arrive in the region on Saturday to help advance the talks. Olmert is already under a criminal probe into accusations he dispensed favors in return for a discount on the 2004 purchase price of a Jerusalem home. He is also being investigated over allegations that as trade minister in 2003, he appointed allies to a state business authority. Last November police concluded there was insufficient evidence to take action against him over his role in the sale of state-owned Bank Leumi when serving as finance minister. Olmert denied wrongdoing in all three cases. Asked if this was also his position regarding the suspicions that prompted Friday's police interrogation, an Olmert's spokeswoman declined comment. Earlier this year, a government-appointed commission said political and army leaders had committed ""serious failings"" during a war against Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon in 2006. The panel did not blame Olmert personally and endorsed key decisions he made."

Vodafone, the world's largest mobile phone company by revenue, has been competing with operators and retailers to secure the right to sell the iPhone - the touch-screen device which combines Apple's popular iPod music player, a video player and Web browser. Vodafone will sell the iPhone in 10 countries. O2 has described the device as a star performer which draws increased numbers of customers into its stores. Customers using the phone have also driven up data revenues by surfing the Internet and sending emails, a key attraction to operators as the cost of making calls decreases. ""Later this year, Vodafone customers in Australia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Italy, India, Portugal, New Zealand, South Africa and Turkey will be able to purchase the iPhone for use on the Vodafone network,"" the British-based firm said in a statement without giving any more details"
en.15.65.359.2008.5.2,Dippenaar says quota system needs revamping,"BIRMINGHAM, England, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Boeta Dippenaar criticised South Africa's racial quota system on Thursday and urged his country to revamp the policy or risk losing more top players like Kevin Pietersen. Dippenaar, who retired from internationals in January and is now playing for English county Leicestershire, was elected president of the South African Cricketers' Association last month. The 30-year-old batsman has appealed to administrators to govern the sport with a focus on cricket, not politics. ""They need to make sure we as sportsmen are judged on our skill,"" Dippenaar told Reuters. ""We are on dangerous ground as soon as we start saying 'x' amount of players have to be white and 'x' amount of players have to be of colour. ""We don't mind if the whole team is black if that's the best team. Throughout the whole transformation process a lot of patriotism has been lost."" Cricket South Africa is now committed to a racial transformation policy ""aimed at ensuring the imbalances of the past are redressed as soon as possible"". But Dippenaar said the policy may discourage aspiring youngsters. ""Unfortunately if people had an aspiration to play for South Africa they will now think twice about doing so,"" he said. ""I have always said the game should be surrounded by people with cricketing interests at heart and not people with political interests at heart. There's a distinct difference."" Pietersen, born and raised in South Africa, left the country at 18 to pursue a career in England, citing the racial quota system as one of his reasons. PLAYER EXODUS The Hampshire player, who has since become one of the top-ranked batsmen in the world, was one of the first to make the move and an exodus has followed. Dippenaar was one of six South Africans playing for Leicestershire at Edgbaston on Thursday, with European legislation allowing such opportunities to him and his fellow countrymen. The debate about quotas and how many non-whites should be playing for South Africa continually surfaces. A dispute between the selectors and Norman Arendse, the president of Cricket South Africa, held up the naming of the squad to tour Bangladesh earlier this year. ""No country can afford to lose a player of Pietersen's calibre,"" said Dippenaar, who played 38 tests and 101 one-day internationals. ""That puts a question mark about whether we are doing the right things. We should never have allowed a player of his calibre to fall through our net. ""Can you imagine Jacques Kallis and Kevin Pietersen in the same South Africa team? It would have made a formidable batting lineup"
en.15.65.213.2008.5.7,"Food dropped to Myanmar towns; 22,500 killed in storm","Yangon, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Military helicopters dropped food and drinking water to the cyclone-stricken people of Myanmar's Irrawaddy delta, where entire villages have been virtually washed away, officials said on Wednesday. The military government said nearly 22,500 people were killed and 41,000 missing in the most devastating cyclone in Asia since 1991 when a storm killed 143,000 in neighboring Bangladesh. A doctor in the Irrawaddy delta town of Labutta said villagers had told him thousands died when a series of huge waves slammed into their homes. People clung to trees in a desperate fight for survival. ""All the victims were brought to the town and I asked them, 'How many of you survived?' and they said about 200, 300,"" Aye Kyu told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. ""Then I asked them, 'How many people in your area?' They said about 5,000. The waves were 12, 13, 20 feet high and when the houses were covered in water, they stayed on the roof but the houses were destroyed by strong winds,"" he said. In one town alone, Bogalay, 10,000 people were killed, the reclusive military government has said in a town-by-town list of casualties and damage. As the military's relief operations kicked up a gear, state-run Myanmar TV showed footage of bedraggled survivors lining up on banks of mud to be flown by helicopter out of some of the worst-hit villages. Disease, hunger and thirst now pose a major threat to hundreds of thousands of survivors of Cyclone Nargis, aid agencies said. They urged Myanmar's military rulers to open the doors to international humanitarian relief as hundreds of thousands are homeless in the swamplands of the delta southwest of the biggest city Yangon, which was also hard hit by last weekend's storm. Myanmar TV, the main official source for the number of casualties, on Wednesday re-broadcast Tuesday night's news bulletin. The TV station, monitored outside Myanmar, reported 22,464 killed and 41,054 missing. HELICOPTERS DROP SUPPLIES Other official media reported on Wednesday that military helicopters dropped food and bottled water to villagers in the rice-growing Irrawaddy delta. More than half of Myanmar's 53 million people live in five worst-hit states, called divisions. Aid groups and governments, including U.S. President George W. Bush, asked the military to relax their tight grip to allow humanitarian assistance into Myanmar, which has been ruled by the military for 46 years. In a rare news conference on Tuesday, Information Minister Kyaw Hsan appealed for help, saying ""the government needs the cooperation of the people and well-wishers from home and abroad"". There was some anger on the storm-ravaged streets of Yangon at soaring food prices and long queues for petrol, but the overall mood in the city of five million was of resignation rather than revolution. Last September, the military violently cracked down on Buddhist monk-led demonstrations, killing 31 people and triggering international outrage. ""There won't be demonstrations,"" one taxi driver said. ""People don't want to be shot."" Government and private offices were unable to function with power cut off and staff absent. Some office workers just sat there in the darkness. ""We can't do anything without electricity,"" one of the office workers said. ""We sit around in the darkness sharing our sufferings and complaints."" A queue of women and children holding buckets and tubs snaked around a corner in Yangon on Wednesday, past a street market where vegetables sold at three times last week's prices despite government appeals to traders not to profit from the disaster. The U.N.'s World Food Programme began doling out rice in Yangon. The first batch of more than $10 million of foreign aid arrived from Thailand but lack of equipment slowed distribution. Two more aid flights are due to land from India on Wednesday. Reflecting the scale of the crisis, the junta said it would postpone by two weeks a constitutional referendum in the worst-hit areas. However, the referendum, part of the army's much-criticized ""roadmap to democracy"", would proceed as planned elsewhere on Saturday."

The player will not be involved in Australia's tour of the Caribbean but took the chance to boost his fitness after shocking team mates and officials by quitting the game in January. Tait was invited to take part in the camp for the first two days after meeting Cricket Australia (CA) officials and selectors to discuss his new contract.

The capture of the rebel camp in Mannar comes a week after one of the bloodiest battles in the country's long civil war. ""Advancing troops...brought the entire area under control on Wednesday,"" a spokesman at the Media centre for National security said. The military said a suspected rebel roadside bomb in central Anuradhapura killed two police commandos, while police retaliation killed two rebels. The military said fighting in the far north a day earlier, killed 25 Tamil Tiger rebels and injured 37 while four solders died and 14 were injured. After driving the Tamil Tiger rebels from the east, the armed forces are now focused on Tiger-held areas in north, intensifying fighting in a 25-year-old civil war that has killed an estimated 70,000 people since 1983. Fighting between government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has intensified since the government formally pulled out of a 6-year-old ceasefire pact in January, though a renewed civil war has been raging since 2006. The Tigers, fighting for an independent state in the north and east, were not immediately available for comment on the latest fighting, but said intense military artillery fire killed a civilian in Welioya area on Wednesday. Analysts say both the government and rebels often inflate enemy death tolls and play down their own losses. The reports are rarely possible to verify independently. President Mahinda Rajapaksa's government has pledged to destroy the Tigers militarily. The rebels have hit back with bombings in Colombo and elsewhere in the relatively peaceful south of the island when they have come under military pressure in the past"

en.15.65.14.2008.5.1,Title in Real's hands against Osasuna,"MADRID, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The champagne was put on ice at the Bernabeu after Villarreal beat Real Betis last week, but this weekend the destination of the league title is in Real Madrid's hands. Real will pocket their 31st Spanish championship if Villarreal fail to beat Getafe on Sunday (kickoff 1500 GMT) or they win their match at Osasuna (1900). Real's Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder is confident the team will not have to wait any longer to celebrate the title. ""I want to win the league against Osasuna and I'm sure we are going to do it,"" he said earlier this week. ""Villarreal aren't going to slip up but neither are we and so we will be champions this weekend."" Osasuna, however, have plenty to play for and are likely to prove difficult opponents. The Navarrans, who lost 3-0 at Valencia last weekend, are just two points above the relegation zone and can ill afford to concede any points if they are to avoid the drop. Goalkeeper Ricardo will be able to play after his red card against Valencia was overturned on appeal, but centre forward Dady is a doubt. Real are likely to be strengthened by the return of Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who should get a run after a six-week absence following ankle surgery, but playmaker Guti is a doubt because of a strained knee ligament. SECOND PLACE Second-placed Villarreal, who are 10 points adrift of Real with four games to play, are aiming to ensure they do not gift their rivals the title by slipping up against an out-of-sorts Getafe. ""We are hoping that Real don't become champions this week,"" said club president Fernando Roig. ""As usual we will be going for the win and we will be fighting until the bitter end to finish as high up the table as possible."" Although Villarreal's hopes of winning the title are slim, a win over Getafe will put them in a strong position to finish as runners-up and beat Barcelona to the all-important automatic place in the group phase of the Champions League. The Catalans are four points behind Villarreal and morale has taken a bashing after their 1-0 defeat against Manchester United in the semi-finals of this season's competition. Frank Rijkaard's side have failed to score in their last four outings in all competitions and there are concerns about how their fans will react in Sunday's match at home to Valencia. ""We are devastated by the defeat,"" Argentine centre back Gabriel Milito told reporters after the United match. ""Now we need to win our remaining four matches and finish the season as best we can."
en.15.65.261.2008.4.30,US deaths in Iraq at seven-month high in April,"BAGHDAD, Wed Apr 30(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The death toll for U.S. troops in Iraq reached a seven month high in April, with the reported deaths of three more soldiers on Wednesday bringing the monthly toll to 47, the highest since last September. U.S. and Iraqi forces have been engaged in intense fighting over the past month with Shi'ite militia fighters in Baghdad's tightly-packed Sadr City slum. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who launched a crackdown against the Mehdi Army militia a month ago in the southern city of Basra, said on Wednesday the government would disarm the fighters by force if they refuse to lay down their weapons. Two hospitals in Sadr City, the Shi'ite slum that has been the focus of fighting in the capital, said they had received the bodies of 421 Iraqis killed and treated more than 2,400 wounded there since late March. Government spokesman Tahseen al-Sheikhly said the toll there was higher, with more than 900 killed. Many of the dead and wounded have been civilians, caught in the crossfire in the crowded slum. Some of the heaviest fighting has taken place in the past three days, with militiamen taking advantage of blinding dust storms that ground U.S. attack helicopters to launch large ambushes of U.S. and Iraqi positions. U.S. forces have responded with tank fire and surface-to-surface missiles, destroying buildings. Thirty-four bodies and 112 wounded victims were brought to the two Sadr City hospitals in the last 24 hours, hospital officials said. American forces said they killed 34 militiamen in Sadr City on Tuesday in a series of clashes including one street battle that raged for four hours. April's U.S. death toll is the highest since September 2007, when 65 U.S. soldiers died in Iraq, according to official figures tracked by icasualties.org, an independent website. The toll is still far lower than a year ago, however. In April 2007, 104 U.S. services members were killed in Iraq. ""We lost three soldiers killed last night,"" U.S. military spokesman Major Mark Cheadle said on Wednesday. Around half the U.S. troop deaths in Iraq this month have been in Baghdad, including several killed by rocket and mortar fire from Sadr City. MALIKI SETS CONDITIONS Maliki aimed some of his toughest language yet at the Shi'ite fighters on Wednesday, singling out the Mehdi Army by name and grouping it with Sunni Arab groups like al Qaeda as organizations that must be dissolved. He set down four conditions -- that militia disarm, stop interfering in state affairs, stop running their own courts and hand over wanted fugitives -- or face a military assault. ""To refuse these conditions means the continuation of the government's efforts to disarm them by force,"" Maliki said at a news conference inside Baghdad's fortified Green Zone government and diplomatic compound. ""There is no alternative to these conditions. The alternative is the continuation of force and clashes until we reach the end, to get rid of the weapons and the gangs who are carrying weapons."" Maliki, himself a Shi'ite, launched a crackdown against militia fighters loyal to anti-American Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr last month in the southern city of Basra. After initial setbacks, the Basra offensive appears to have been a success in driving fighters from the streets there. But the militiamen remain in control of much of Baghdad's Sadr City."

""We had very candid discussions ... we have a good rapport, so that is always very helpful,"" Lodi Gyari told Reuters at Hong Kong airport as he prepared to board a flight for India, home of the Tibet government-in-exile. ""We have agreed to meet once again so I think it is a good sign, but we will make a formal statement after I have reported to his Holiness when I get back to India."" Lodi Gyari and another envoy held a meeting with Chinese officials, the first since an eruption of Tibetan protests and deadly riots two months ago, in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen on Monday. The unrest, the most serious challenge to Chinese rule in the mountainous region for nearly two decades, prompted anti-China protests around the world that disrupted the international leg of the Olympic torch relay and led to calls for Western leaders to boycott August's Beijing Games. China proposed the latest talks last month after Western governments urged it to open new dialogue with the Dalai Lama, who says he wants a high level of autonomy, not independence, for the predominantly Buddhist Himalayan homeland he fled in 1959. But state-run Xinhua news agency said on Sunday that the meeting was arranged at the government-in-exile's repeated request for contacts and consultations with Beijing. Lodi Gyari, speaking to the media for the first time since the closed-door Shenzhen meeting, said a date for a further round of talks would only be announced after consultations with the Dalai Lama"

Other Brazilian clubs did better in third-round first-leg ties as Flamengo and Fluminense won away to America and Atletico Nacional while Sao Paulo ground out a goalless draw in Nacional's notorious Parque Centenario in Montevideo. Sao Paulo came through a bad-tempered match at a ground known for a raucous atmosphere where even the ball boys regularly cause trouble for opposing teams. Boca's win over Cruzeiro was marred when a linesman suffered a cut forehead after being struck by a missile thrown from the crowd, prompting referee Jorge Larrionda to finish the game one minute early. The incident happened in front of the stands where the most expensive seats and VIP boxes are situated, including the one used by former Argentina captain Diego Maradona. The South American Football Confederation (CSF) invariably allows results to stand in such cases, and both Argentina and Brazilian media said Boca had won although the hosts could face sanctions. Former Barcelona and Villarreal midfielder Riquelme fired Boca ahead in the sixth minute and Jesus Datolo scored a second in the 65th after cutting inside and slotting the ball in at the near post. Cruzeiro took advantage to score an away goal in the 78th minute with a long-range shot from Fabricio which took a wicked deflection. GOALKEEPER DISMISSED Flamengo won 4-2 at troubled America, who are bottom of the Mexican championship despite being widely regarded as the country's biggest club. Marcinho twice put Flamengo ahead and, although Diego Cervantes and Enrique Esqueda replied for the hosts, late goals from Diego Tardelli and Leo Moura gave Flamengo an impressive win. Argentine midfielder Dario Conca scored with a long-range goal in the 75th minute to give Fluminense a 2-1 win over Colombian champions Atletico Nacional, who played most of the game with 10 men. Atletico goalkeeper David Ospina was sent off in the 20th minute for a foul which also resulted in a penalty converted by Thiago Neves. Francisco Arrue fired the equaliser early in the second half. A controversial late penalty gave San Lorenzo a 2-1 win over River Plate in the evening's other match. Andres Silvera swept San Lorenzo ahead in the 29th minute of the all-Argentine clash and Colombian Radamel Falcao Garcia headed Diego Simeone's team level two minutes later"

Pacer Panna Ghosh removed opener Delunu Silva (2) in the third over while Salma Khatun dismissed one-down Shashikala Sirwardene (10) to reduce Sri Lanka to 36 for two in 7.3 overs, but afterwards they failed to maintain the line and length to allow the opponents to go fast to the target. Bangladesh gave away 25 extra runs and Chamari Polgawpola (32) and Suwini de Alwis (26) put on 59 runs for the unbroken third wicket to steer Sri Lanka easily home. After deciding to bat first, Bangladesh faced trouble losing Shukhtara (1) and Panna (4) with Shivomala Weerakkody removing both players.

en.15.65.346.2008.5.6,Georgia says `very close' to war with Russia,"Brussels, Tue May 6,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's deployment of extra troops in the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia has brought the prospect of war ""very close"", a minister of ex-Soviet Georgia said on Tuesday. Separately, in comments certain to fan rising tension between Moscow and Tbilisi, the ""foreign minister"" of the breakaway Black Sea region was quoted as saying it was ready to hand over military control to Russia. ""We literally have to avert war,"" Temur Iakobashvili, a Georgian State Minister, told reporters in Brussels. Asked how close to such a war the situation was, he replied: ""Very close, because we know Russians very well."" ""We know what the signals are when you see propaganda waged against Georgia. We see Russian troops entering our territories on the basis of false information,"" he said. Georgia, a vital energy transit route in the Caucasus region, has angered Russia, its former Soviet master with which it shares a land border, by seeking NATO membership. An April summit of the US-led Western alliance stopped short of giving it a definite track towards membership but confirmed it would enter one day. Russia has said its troop build-up is needed to counter what it says are Georgian plans to attack Abkhazia, a sliver of land by the Black Sea, and has accused Tbilisi of trying to suck the West into a war -- allegations Georgia rejects. Tensions have been steadily mounting and escalated after Georgia accused Russia of shooting down one of its drones over Abkhazia in April, a claim Russia denied. An extra Russian contingent began arriving in Abkhazia last week. Moscow has not said how many troops would be added but said the total would remain within the 3,000 limit allowed under a United Nations-brokered ceasefire agreement signed in 1994. Diplomats expect the reinforcement to be of the order of 1,200. SECURITY GUARANTEES Russian soldiers acting as peacekeepers patrol areas between Georgian and Abkhazian forces but handing full military control of the breakaway province to the Kremlin would alarm both the Georgian government and its allies in the West. ""Those 200 km (120 miles), the distance between the Psou and the Inguri rivers, are all Abkhazia. We agree to Russia taking this territory under its military control,"" Sergei Shamba, ""foreign minister"" of Abkhazia, told the Russian newspaper Izvestia. ""In exchange, we will demand guarantees of our security."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had not received an official request from Abkhazia for its military to take control of the region. After the NATO summit, Moscow announced plans to establish legal links with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, another ""frozen conflict"" region inside Georgia. NATO has urged Russia to reverse the steps and complained that the deployment of extra troops would add to tensions. The European Union has also expressed concerns. Iakobashvili said Georgia was urging the European Union to take a more active role in reducing tensions, with options including participating in border control or policing. ""We should have more Europe in these conflict zones,"" he said, while adding that no decisions on a bigger EU role had been taken during his talks in Brussels"

Garment workers in the capital, Dhaka, defied the state of emergency in April by striking to demand higher wages to cover the cost of rising food prices, the report said. The situation is unlikely to improve over the short term, despite reports of a bumper rice harvest, and further demonstrations are likely, which will test the caretaker government's ability to govern the country, it said. Bangladesh is being governed by an army-backed interim authority that took over in January 2007, following widespread political violence. While around 170 top politicians, including former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Begum Khaleda Zia, have been detained in an anti-corruption drive, the government has failed to contain food and other commodity prices that nearly doubled over the past year. This has caused simmering discontent among a large number of Bangladesh's more than 140 million people, mostly those who live on less than $1 a day The EIU report, obtained by Reuters in Dhaka on Saturday, said despite wide ranging electoral reforms, the next election battle would be fought between long-standing rivals, Hasina's Awami League and Khaleda's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the two largest political parties. The interim government imposed a state of emergency on its takeover, cancelled an election due on Jan. 22, 2007 and pursued a campaign to clean up politics. The government headed by former central bank chief Fakhruddin Ahmed has vowed to hold a free and fair election before the end of this year, but the political parties have asked for the immediate release of the detained former prime ministers and lifting the emergency. Otherwise, they threatened to defy the emergency and boycott the election. The EIU report said the budget deficit in fiscal year 2007/08 (July-June) could rise to the equivalent of 5 percent of GDP, compared with the official target of 4.7 percent. It said real GDP is expected to grow by 5.7 percent in 2007/08 and by 6 percent in 2008/09 while consumer price inflation is expected to average 8.9 percent in 2008, after averaging an estimated 9.1 percent in 2007. The government expects GDP to grow more than 6 percent in the current fiscal year because of strong exports and a likely bumper rice harvest. The EIU said the trade deficit was expected to swell to record levels in 2008/09 ""as demand for industrial raw materials strengthens and international oil prices stay high"""
en.15.65.266.2008.5.2,Some U.S. lawmakers want Olympic opening ceremony boycott,"WASHINGTON May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Some conservative and liberal members of Congress banded together on Thursday to urge a U.S. government boycott of the opening ceremonies of the Summer Olympics in China, accusing Beijing of gross human rights violations. ""No official in the (U.S.) executive branch, in the judicial branch and particularly in the congressional branch ought to attend the opening ceremonies of this Olympics,"" said Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia, a conservative Republican and long-standing critic of China's clampdown on religious groups and its human rights record. Wolf criticized a plan by Beijing he said sends up to 200 North Koreans in China ""back to North Korea and they face torture ... and the world does very little about it."" Sen. Robert Menendez, a liberal Democrat from New Jersey who has called on President George W. Bush to boycott the opening ceremonies of the Games, said China had a ""human rights record of shame."" The Summer Olympics, held every four years, are scheduled to open in Beijing on August 8. As the event nears, protests against China's government policies have flared in the United States and Europe, especially as the ceremonial Olympic torch has been carried across those two continents. China has dismissed the international protests. In an editorial last month, the People's Daily, the Communist Party's mouthpiece, wrote, ""Although a few people with ulterior motives have tried to interfere with and vilify the Beijing Olympics ... this can never alter the determination of the 1.3 billion Chinese to successfully hold the Games for the world."" The White House has said Bush plans to attend the Beijing Olympics, without specifying the opening ceremonies, which are intended to celebrate the athletic events but also provide a huge public relations boost for host countries. At a news conference to highlight concerns about China's human rights record, conservative Rep. Christopher Smith, a New Jersey Republican, called for swift passage of his legislation to prohibit U.S. companies from identifying Internet users to officials of repressive countries. The measure also would require firms to disclose the Internet information they block in order to comply with censorship policies of such countries. In 2006, Congress held hearings on censorship practices of Internet companies, such as Google, in China. Trying to bolster their case for a U.S. government boycott of the opening ceremonies, the lawmakers cited China's role in providing arms to Sudan, which they said had helped foster genocide in Darfur, the arrests of Christians for practicing their religion in China and moves to ""liquidate Tibet's culture."""

The communist North asked soccer's governing body FIFA for the change in venue, but South Korea has no plans to give up hosting the June 22 match. ""We're saying we will let North Korea fly its flag and sing its anthem, but if that's the response they're showing, we're not considering any changes,"" the South Korean Football Association official said. The governments of the two Koreas have yet to sign a peace treaty to end their 1950-1953 war, each claiming to be the rightful ruler of the entire peninsula. North Korea has not allowed a display of the South Korean flag or the playing of the anthem of its neighbour at a public event on its side of the divided peninsula. Its refusal to do so for the March qualifier led FIFA to move the match to Shanghai, where the teams played out a goalless draw. The South has permitted the North's flag to be flown and its anthem played. This is the first time the two Koreas have been drawn in the same World Cup qualifying group in which teams play home and away matches. South Korea top Group Three in Asian qualifying on four points after thrashing Turkmenistan 4-0. The North beat Jordan 1-0 in February"

The regular meetings come after Russia on Tuesday sent extra peacekeeping troops to Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region to counter what it called Georgian plans for an attack, prompting the European Union to accuse Moscow of stoking tensions. A NATO spokesman said Georgia would be discussed at both meetings, but declined further comment. On Monday, NATO ambassadors met Georgian presidential envoy David Bakradze in Brussels. They reiterated support for Georgia and criticized Russian warnings about the possible use of force. In a further show of support, the 26-nation military alliance also announced plans for the envoys to visit Georgia before the end of the year. The mounting crisis between the two ex-Soviet neighbors has alarmed Georgia's Western allies, who see Georgia as a future NATO member and a vital energy transit route. After discussing Georgia with EU ministers in Luxembourg on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated that Moscow would use military force if Georgia attacked Abkhazia or a second Georgian separatist region, South Ossetia. European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana said after the talks that the Russian deployment of extra peacekeepers in Abkhazia was unwise at a time of rising tensions and reiterated EU support for Georgia's territorial integrity. On Wednesday, Dimitrij Rupel, foreign minister of EU president Slovenia, said the European Union wanted to see the situation resolved in a ""tolerant and diplomatic manner"". ""After yesterday's talks I believe that this will happen,"" he told a news conference in Ljubljan"

The committee had been formed to find out the reason for instability in the rod market. There were eight recommendations in the report, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters at the Secretariat. The recommendations included revenue policy, import policy for rods, keeping market prices at a ""rational level"", creating competitive market and an end to monopoly, Zillur said. To come to a final decision, home, finance, commerce and shipping ministries would have to sit together and review the recommendations, the adviser added. ""We have to keep the rod market at a rational level. Those connected to this market should look into the matter,"" the adviser said. ""We won't accept any irrational suggestion by any party in this regard. Prices will not be fixed by force,"" he said. The probe committee chief and public works secretary ASM Rashidul Hai told bdnews24.com Tuesday that they had finalised the probe report. The secretary said: ""The probe committee held a meeting Tuesday and the report was finalised."" ""We were supposed to submit the report by Apr 30. We are able to do that,"" he added. Earlier, the committee led by Hai and a taskforce team visited several ship- breaking yards at Bhatiary in Chittagong on Monday and held a meeting with scrap ship traders, re-rolling millers and rod traders at the Circuit House. The businessmen were asked to reset the prices of scrap iron or scrap plates in one day (Tuesday). The prices of rod were unchanged in Chittagong until Tuesday. A tonne of 40-grade rods was sold at Tk 64,000 and 60-grade rods at Tk 70,000-Tk 72,000 at various shops at Sholoshahar in Chittagong. bdnews24."
en.15.65.31.2008.5.3,Southeast Asia to cooperate over food security,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Southeast Asia nations meeting in Bali have agreed to cooperate over the rice market, Malaysia's trade minister said on Saturday, as rocketing prices shock a region where the grain is a core part of most meals. The issue of food security has hijacked the weekend trade meeting of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on the Indonesian resort island. Malaysian Trade Minister Muhyiddin Yassin told reporters that a statement due to be released on Saturday -- a day earlier than expected -- would include rice. Asked whether ASEAN members had agreed to cooperate over rice, he said: ""Yes, yes,"" without elaborating. Asian rice prices have almost trebled this year. Countries including India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Brazil have imposed curbs on food exports in a bid to secure domestic supplies and limit inflation. In Washington, the African Development Bank pledged $1 billion more for food aid on Friday and urged grain-exporting countries not to restrict shipments. Former U.N. chief Kofi Annan said on Friday that farmers in Africa could double food output in five to 10 years if rich countries partner them in a ""Green Revolution"" for a long-term solution to the continent's food crisis, Annan, who led a meeting of agriculture experts in Salzburg, said in a teleconference call that major funding in the short, medium and long term was required to offset the impact on the world's poorest continent of the sharp price hikes for essential food and fuel. Humanitarian aid could only be the first step of a longer-term strategy which should seek ""to enable African farmers to dramatically increase their output so that Africa can feed itself and not be dependent on food aid"". ""MASSIVE VIOLATION"" OF HUMAN RIGHTS The World Food Program has described soaring food prices as a ""silent tsunami"" that threatens to plunge more than 100 million people from every continent into poverty. The new U.N. food envoy on Friday sought a special meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council this month to address a global food crisis he said was a ""massive violation"" of human rights. Olivier De Schutter said he wanted the Geneva-based Human Rights Council to hold a special session around May 22 or 23 to complement efforts by other international agencies to tackle the crisis and to establish it as a human rights issue. ""If we had 100 million persons arrested in a dictatorial regime, if we had 100 million persons beaten up by police, of course we'd be marching in the streets and we'd be convening special sessions,"" De Schutter said at a news conference. Protests, strikes and riots have erupted in developing countries around the world after dramatic rises in the prices of wheat, rice, corn, oils and other essential foods that have made it difficult for poor people to make ends meet. U.S. President George W. Bush proposed this week $770 million in new U.S. food aid to stave off the crisis, pledging Washington would take the lead in combating global hunger. Bush said on Friday that food prices have been rising as a result of soaring energy prices but the use of corn-based ethanol is not the main driver behind rising prices at the supermarket."
en.15.65.454.2008.5.1,Clinton aims message at working class in Indiana,"Portage, Indiana, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hillary Clinton pulled into a gas station in a borrowed pickup truck on Wednesday hoping to drive home the political message that she feels the pain of the working class at the pump. The Democratic presidential candidate is making as much political theater as she can -- including using a commuter as a prop -- to press her appeal to blue-collar voters anxious about soaring gas prices as she campaigns in Indiana this week. Before a crucial nominating contest in the state next week, Clinton used the common political tactic of getting close to voter concerns by joining their lives. On Wednesday she joined Jason Wilfing, a sheet-metal worker, for part of his daily 45-minute commute. They rode in a large pickup, borrowed from his boss because his own truck was too small to accommodate Secret Service agents, and, accompanied by nine security vehicles, drove to a gas station. Clinton paid $64 for Wilfing to fill up half the truck's gas tank -- watchdog group Consumer Reports estimates such a truck gets 10 miles to the gallon -- and told reporters how voters like Wilfing badly need a respite from high fuel costs. She is proposing a ""gas tax holiday,"" in which the federal tax on gasoline would be lifted temporarily for consumers weighed down by skyrocketing costs at the gas pump. ""If you're like a lot of people I meet who commute 60, 75 miles, who like living in the country but their job is pretty far away, this is going to help,"" she said. 'RESPONSIVE CHORD' Republican presidential hopeful John McCain also has proposed suspending the 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal tax rate during the peak summer driving months. But Clinton's Democratic rival, Barack Obama, has criticized the plan as pure politics and said the only way to lower the price of gas is to use less oil. Many economists agree with Obama, saying that since refineries cannot increase their supply of gasoline in the space of a few summer months, lower prices will just boost demand and the benefits will flow to oil companies, not consumers. Still, political strategist Jeffrey Plaut said Clinton was ""hitting a responsive chord."" ""Working people in Indiana are getting angry every time they fill up their tanks,"" he said. ""Targeting gas prices is good politics."" The focus on working-class voters comes on the heels of accusations by the Clinton campaign that Obama was elitist after his comments that some Americans cling to religion and guns out of economic frustration. Clinton has ""found her groove with white, blue-collar workers,"" said political analyst Larry Sabato at the University of Virginia. ""The white, blue-collar guy says, 'Good for her, that would help, at least somebody is trying to do something,'"" Sabato said. Jonathan Alter, a Newsweek columnist, called the gas tax holiday a ""crass ploy for votes"" that would offer only small relief to consumers and encourage gasoline consumption. Never mind the long-term consequences, said Douglas Muzzio, professor of public affairs at City University of New York. ""She's talking to the voters that she needs next Tuesday,"" he said. ""The larger context doesn't matter right now."

en.15.65.418.2008.5.2,Russia sends extra troops to Georgian rebel region,"Moscow, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday an extra contingent of its troops had begun arriving in Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia, a move Tbilisi said was an illegal act of military aggression. Russia announced this week it was deploying hundreds of additional peacekeeping troops to the tiny sliver of land of the Black Sea to counter what it said were Georgian plans for an attack on Moscow-backed separatists in the region. Georgia summoned Russia's ambassador to protest against the deployment and said it had raised tensions in the region, where separatists fought a war against Georgian forces in the 1990s. Russia's defense ministry said the contingent would remain within the 3,000 limit allowed under a United Nations-brokered ceasefire agreement signed in 1994. Russian state television broadcast footage of a column of Russian army trucks and armored vehicles driving through Sukhumi, Abkhazia's main city. ""The contingent is completing the concentration of units in their deployment locations,"" Russia's RIA news agency quoted the defense ministry as saying in a statement. ""The Russian peacekeepers have begun equipping arms stores, vehicle parks and field kitchens. Operations are under way to guard the deployment points and fit out command points and communications systems."" Diplomats have said Russia is sending about 1,200 extra troops to the region, though officials in Moscow have not given a figure for the scale of the re-enforcement. ""We are extremely concerned with Russia's decision to increase its military presence in Abkhazia,"" David Bakradze, a Georgian presidential special envoy, told journalists in Tbilisi. ""Under international law, the deployment of any military force without the consent of the sovereign country is clearly defined as an act of aggression. Therefore what we face today is an act of Russian military aggression in Abkhazia."" TENSIONS Western diplomats say Moscow's recent steps have escalated tensions in the volatile region and say it would now take only a small spark to ignite a new round of fighting. The Caucasus region is a key transit route for energy supplies to the West. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the United States was ""very concerned"" about Russia's deployment and said she would raise the issue when she meets Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in London on Friday. ""It is extremely important that Russia respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia. Abkhazia and South Ossetia are integral parts of Georgia. They are not lands that are somehow disconnected from the Georgian state,"" Rice told reporters as she flew to London. ""I have talked to both Georgians and Russians to say let's not let any of this get out of hand,"" she added. A semi-tropical strip of land on the Black Sea coast, Abkhazia used to be the playground of the Soviet elite. It was left devastated by the fighting between separatist forces and Georgian troops during the 1990s. It is recognized internationally as part of Georgia but has run its own affairs, with support from neighboring Russia, since the fighting ended. Ex-Soviet Georgia, which has angered Moscow by seeking NATO membership and is a vital energy transit route, says the Russian peacekeepers side with the separatists and is lobbying for them to be replaced with a multinational force. It has denied any plans to attack Abkhazia. Russian generals say their peacekeepers prevent an ethnic bloodbath in the region. The deployment followed an announcement by Moscow that it was intensifying ties with the separatists and allegations from Tbilisi that Russia had shot down a Georgian spy drone. Moscow denied the allegation. Most of Abkhazia's population, who are ethnically distinct from Georgians, say they were forcibly absorbed into Georgia under Soviet rule and want to exercise their right to self-determination. Georgia argues that the majority of Abkhazia's pre-war population want to remain part of Georgia, but they were forced to flee and have since been living as refugees."
en.15.65.154.2008.5.1,Scientists develop new type of memory circuit,"CHICAGO, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - It took about 40 years to find it, but scientists at Hewlett-Packard said on Wednesday they discovered a fourth basic type of electrical circuit that could lead to a computer you never have to boot up. The finding proves what until now had only been theory -- but could save millions from the tedium of waiting for a computer to find its ""place,"" the researchers said. Basic electronics theory teaches that there are three fundamental elements of a passive circuit -- resistors, capacitors and inductors. But in the 1970s, Leon Chua of the University of California at Berkeley, theorized there should be a fourth called a memory resistor, or memristor, for short, and he worked out the mathematical equations to prove it. Now, a team at Hewlett-Packard led by Stanley Williams has proven that 'memristance' exists. They developed a mathematical model and a physical example of a memristor, which they describe in the journal Nature. ""It's very different from any other electrical device,"" Williams said of his memristor in a telephone interview. ""No combination of resistor, capacitor or inductor will give you that property."" Williams likens the property to water flowing through a garden hose. In a regular circuit, the water flows from more than one direction. But in a memory resistor, the hose remembers what direction the water (or current) is flowing from, and it expands in that direction to improve the flow. If water or current flows from the other direction, the hose shrinks. ""It remembers both the direction and the amount of charge that flows through it. ... That is the memory,"" Williams said. The discovery is more than an academic pursuit for Williams, who said the finding could lead a new kind of computer memory that would never need booting up. Conventional computers use dynamic random access memory or DRAM, which is lost when the power is turned off, and must be accessed from the hard drive when the computer goes back on. But a computer that incorporates this new kind of memory circuit would never lose it place, even when the power is turned off. ""If you turn on your computer it will come up instantly where it was when you turned it off. That is a very interesting potential application, and one that is very realistic,"" Williams said. But he said understanding this new circuit element could be critical as companies attempt to build ever smaller devices. ""It's essential that people understand this to be able to go further into the world of nanoelectronics,"" referring to electronics on the nano scale -- objects tens of thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. ""It turns out that memristance, this property, gets more important as the device gets smaller. That is another major reason it took so long to find,"" Williams said."
en.15.65.448.2008.5.4,Farmers face climate challenge in quest for more food,"SINGAPORE (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If farmers think they have a tough time producing enough rice, wheat and other grain crops, global warming is going to present a whole new world of challenges in the race to produce more food, scientists say. In a warmer world beset by greater extremes of droughts and floods, farmers will have to change crop management practices, grow tougher plant varieties and be prepared for constant change in the way they operate, scientists say. ""There certainly are going to be lots of challenges in the future. Temperature is one of them, water is another,"" said Lisa Ainsworth, a molecular biologist with the United States Department of Agriculture. Spiraling grain prices in recent months have startled governments long used to affordable rice, wheat, soy and maize. But rising demand and likely greater climate variability and more fluctuations in crop output could mean even more uncertainty for prices. Current estimates suggest demand for cereals will jump by more than 50 percent by 2050 as the world's population rises from 6.6 billion to about 9 billion. The world has already warmed by about 0.7 degrees Celsius on average since the 1800s and studies show higher temperatures can cut yields, particularly in the tropics where a lot of rice is grown. ""In Northeastern China, low temperatures, a short growing season and lack of water limit production, so rising temperatures in the future may have beneficial impacts there,"" said Ainsworth. ""However, in the southern parts of the country, higher temperatures will likely cause yield losses,"" she told Reuters. Pollution is another threat. Ozone, which is produced at ground-level by sunlight interacting with pollution from burning fossil fuels, can cut plant productivity. The higher the ozone levels, the worse the damage. In the northern hemisphere, ozone is a growing problem and is estimated to cost farmers billions of dollars in lost production. ""In the major rice-growing regions, which are India and China, ground-level ozone concentrations even today are very high and certainly exceed the threshold for damage. Ozone is already decreasing yield potential in many areas,"" Ainsworth said. Rice is grown in more than 100 countries. More than half the world's population rely on it as their main food source. HEAT STRESS A major U.N. climate panel report last year said in low-latitude regions, even moderate temperature rises of between 1 and 2 degrees Celsius could trim crop yields. In cooler mid to high-latitude regions, localized increases up to 3 degrees Celsius plus higher amounts of carbon dioxide in the air could be beneficial to yields, provided there was enough water. But anything beyond 3 degrees locally would be bad for crop yields, said the panel's Fourth Assessment Report on the impacts of climate change, which drew on the expertise of hundreds of scientists from around the world. Studies show that higher carbon dioxide levels, on their own, can boost rice and wheat production but any benefit is negated by the stress caused by higher temperatures, lack of water from changes in rainfall patterns and pollution. Plants breathe in CO2 to make sugars and other complex compounds grow. Carbon dioxide levels from burning fossil fuels are rising rapidly and are now the highest than at any time in the past 650,000 years. Last year, they reached near 390 parts per million from about 280 ppm at the start of the Industrial Revolution. Unless nations drastically rein in their carbon emissions, the level could reach 550 ppm by 2050, the climate panel says, leading to sharp increases in temperatures, particularly at higher latitudes. The trick for farmers is to adapt, and scientists say the crops of the coming decades will have to be very different. ""We will see a suite of new traits that are integrated into the varieties that are planted in the future,"" said Ainsworth. ""This is something we do need to start soon because anything that we hope to develop today probably won't be in the field until 2018 and the climate then will be very different."" In the Philippines, the International Rice Research Institute has a long history of developing rice varieties. But the pace of climate change in the future is a big worry. NEED TO BREED ""There is still a lot of uncertainty in the climate modeling when it comes to the regional level,"" said Reiner Wassmann of IRRI. But it was clear temperatures would rise. ""The other mega trend we see is that we will have more climate extremes. In some places there might be more drought, in others it may be submergence, from floods, in some places it might be both,"" said Wassmann, coordinator of the Rice and Climate Change Consortium at IRRI. ""That is really a new challenge for development of cropping systems and I don't want to limit it to only plant breeding. We have to be clear that this is no silver bullet and that if we speed-up plant breeding everything will be fine. Certainly not. ""We also have to improve crop management and water saving techniques have come into the picture to cope with drought,"" he said. In major wheat grower Australia, higher temperatures will threaten crop yields, depending on the location. But it will be changes in rainfall that are likely to have the biggest impact. ""A rise of up to 2 degrees Celsius, that by itself could be coped with. The much bigger problem is what happens to rainfall,"" said Mark Howden, a senior scientist with Australia's state-backed research body the CSIRO. ""Once we get above a 10-15 percent reduction in rainfall we start to get into negative conditions for everything,"" he said. ""Under those circumstances we would see major declines in wheat production even allowing for the technological improvements that we've got under our belts that we could use,"" said Howden, theme leader of the CSIRO's climate adaptation program. If the world keeps on emitting greenhouse gases at the present rate, computer models suggest southern Australia will become much drier. ""We will need to think about smart ways of feeding the world,"" said Howden, who called for more investment for research by government and industry. ""We are looking at a requirement to double agricultural production by 2050, so this isn't the time when we have the luxury of cutting back our agriculture. We're on a treadmill (and) we need to keeping running faster and faster."""

en.15.65.435.2008.5.1,CA pledges priority to rights of workers,"Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Thursday said the government attached highest priority to establishing the fundamental rights of the workers at all levels. ""The working people's contribution in the development, production and construction processes is immense. The wheels of civilisation advance while the wheels of the industries rotate, the economy thrives soaking in the sweat of the working class people toiling,"" he said. The interim government head made the remarks at a discussion organised by the labour and manpower ministry on the May Day at Osmany Memorial Auditorium in the capital. ""Recognising this basic interdependence, we have been emphasising ensuring the fundamental rights of the workers so that the working class realises that their country appreciates that the change in the country's people and its economic wellbeing depends largely on the change of the workers' situation."" ""We firmly believe that it is difficult to keep the wheels of development going if the 'just' rights of the workers who are moving those wheels all the time are not ensured and established."" He said the government had been working to further the working class's interests as a precondition to advancement on the road of industrialisation. To formulate the Bangladesh Labour Law 2006, a massive job of analysing, updating and synthesising 25 labour laws of the past has been accomplished, he added. The primary draft of the labour law has been prepared. ""I would tell all concerned to make the law more meaningful, production- and development-friendly and workers' welfare-oriented as is the present day reality. I also request all parties to abide by the rules of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in this connection,"" Fakhruddin said.

""I don't think we will get a meaningful election without the two leaders,"" the former finance minister said as the BNP leaders from Sylhet met him in the city. ""There should be options for the two leaders to engage in the election process,"" he said. Saifur, who is leading a faction of the BNP, also said he wanted ""a greater participation"" of the people in the polls. Former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and Saifur-led group's secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed were also present there. Replying to a query, Hafizuddin said there was no need for re-demarcating the election constituencies. He suggested that the government should be cautious so that the planned elections were not hampered because of the re-demarcation. Meanwhile, BNP factional leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain has separately called upon all political parties and the people to thwart what he said was an ill-designed election. Speaking at a May Day discussion at the National Press Club, organised by the Sramik Dal, Delwar said they would resist an election that would lack people's mandate. Delwar, known as a Khaleda loyalist, asked all political parties to stand united for the cause. He accused the Election Commission of conspiring to form a ""rubber-stamp parliament."" Labelling the EC as a ""very controversial"" institution, Delwar said it had been hatching a conspiracy to curb people's rights by promulgating an ordinance bypassing the parliament. ""They want to form a rubber-stamp parliament with the people of their liking keeping the BNP outside. But the BNP will never accept that notion,"" he said. He said a prolonged state of emergency was curbing the rights of workers. The BNP chairperson's adviser retired brigadier general ASM Hannan Shah said that the caretaker government had failed to protect the country's border and sovereignty. ""Part of South Talpatty is now under the control of India. But the government has remained silent,"" he alleged. Sramik Dal president and BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan presided over the discussion while BNP leader Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, acting office secretary Rizvy Ahmed, Sramik Dal senior vice-president Abul Hossain Chowdhury also spoke. bdnews24"
en.15.65.6.2008.5.7,Emergency evacuation as Chile volcano spits lava,"Chaiten, Chile, May 7 (Reuters) - Crackling with explosions, Chile's Chaiten volcano began spitting lava on Tuesday following its first eruption in thousands of years, and Navy warships were deployed to evacuate nearby residents in the southern region of Patagonia. Chaiten erupted last Friday, sending a towering plume of ash into the sky that has since coated the surrounding area of southern Chile and reached into neighboring Argentina. The settlement of Chaiten, six miles (10 km) from the volcano, looked like a ghost town on Tuesday. Aside from a small contingent of Navy sailors and a few journalists, only dogs, chickens and horses remained standing in the ash. Explosions and loud groaning noises resounded from the crater of the 3,280-foot (1,000-meter) volcano, which had been dormant for thousands of years. No lava flow has yet been detected down Chaiten's sides, but Chile's National Emergency Office said the volcano was spitting bits of molten rock and that remaining civilians and troops were being evacuated across a fjord. ""The situation has changed suddenly,"" national emergency official Rodrigo Rojas said in an interview. ""Today the volcano is erupting with pyroclastic material on a different scale."" The towering ash cloud was clearly visible from the southern town of Puerto Montt, where many desperate evacuees were being sheltered. ""I am very worried to have left my house, my pet, my animals behind. All I want is for this to be over,"" said Carola Perez, a 22-year-old housewife evacuated to the town. The government ordered the evacuation of a 30-mile (50 km) radius around the volcano -- which lies some 760 miles (1,220 km) south of the capital, Santiago -- including two dozen people who had refused to leave their homes and animals. It appealed to anyone still on remote farms in the area to leave. Military personnel, police and journalists were being ferried to join dozens of civilians already aboard warships waiting in the fjord off Chaiten. Around 4,200 people, nearly the whole population of Chaiten, have already been evacuated. Sparsely populated Patagonia is the southernmost swathe of Latin America that cuts across Chile and Argentina and is home to towering snow-capped peaks, some of them volcanoes, glaciers and log cabins, and is a gold mine for dinosaur fossil hunters. DENSE CLOUD OF ASH Luis Lara, a government geologist, said he did not expect a catastrophic collapse of the Chaiten volcano, but that a cloud of dense, very hot material could coat the surrounding area. ""This produces a more complicated scenario,"" Lara said. ""A dense cloud of pyroclastic material could move down its slopes, and that causes much more damage (than a spray of lava)."" ""The entire volcano will not (collapse), but the eruptive column could, and that is sufficient material to be displaced down its sides and into areas nearby,"" he added. ""Lava flow would not reach Chaiten, but hot fragments, ash and gas could."" A second town, Futaleufu, has also been coated with ash and is being evacuated. The area is some distance from Chile's vital mining industry farther north. Some of Futaleufu's 1,000 or so residents have already crossed into neighboring Argentina, where some areas have also been showered with thick ash and where flights and schools were suspended. Argentina is not evacuating residents from the worst-affected zones, instead advising them to stay indoors. ""It's a horrible situation. Sometimes it goes all dark and it doesn't stop raining ash,"" said Cecilia Rimoldi, a resident of the southern Argentine tourist town of El Bolson. The ash is more than 6 inches (15 cm) thick in some places near Chaiten, contaminating water supplies and coating houses, vehicles and trees. Thousands of head of cattle are being moved out of the area. Chile has the world's second most active string of volcanoes behind Indonesia. It is home to 2,000 volcanoes, 500 of which experts say are potentially active. Around 60 have erupted over the past 450 years."

The network reported that it obtained a transcript of an in-chambers hearing during which US District Judge David Carter said, ""There is a real risk"" of losing the jury trial if Murdoch does not take the stand and ""briefly say, 'I didn't do it,' and 'I didn't know about it.'"" News Corp unit NDS Group PLC is being sued in Los Angeles federal court, accused of hiring hackers to steal and post data that allowed free access to DISH Network Corp's satellite television service. News Corp owns rival satellite provider DirecTV. News Corp has denied wrongdoing and that Murdoch knew about the allegation of hacking that took place in the 1990s. Closing arguments are expected this week. The lawsuit was brought by EchoStar Communications, which later split into EchoStar Corp and DISH, against NDS and NDS America, which provide security technology to a global satellite network that includes satellite TV service DirecTV. Carter said previously that the case could bring an award of ""hundreds of millions or perhaps billions"" in damages based on claims of lost revenue and the cost of fixing the compromised system. ABC reported on Monday that Judge Carter said during the in-chambers meeting, ""If you get to the punitive phase, and any one of these jurors assume that the top of the organization had any information concerning this or had information and didn't act upon it, that could be hundreds of millions of dollars.""

en.15.65.121.2008.5.4,"""Iron Man"" gets heavy start at box office","LOS ANGELES, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - ""Iron Man,"" the latest Marvel comics title brought to the big screen, grossed an estimated $32.5 million from its first full day in North American theaters, independent box office analysts reported on Saturday. That tally, generated from Friday showings in some 4,100 U.S. and Canadian cinemas, put ""Iron Man"" on track to meet or exceed the $85 million-plus opening weekends posted by sequels to two other Marvel franchises -- ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men."" ""Iron Man"" stars Robert Downey Jr. as a billionaire industrialist and playboy named Tony Stark who wrestles with a midlife crisis as he invents a high-tech suit of armor that transforms him into a superhero. The movie, which cost about $150 million to make and another $75 million to market, co-stars Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow and has drawn mostly favorable reviews. Distributed through Viacom Inc's Paramount Pictures, the film is the first self-financed production from Marvel Studios and is being closely watched as the first major release of the summer movie season. The 18-weekend stretch from May through August can account for as much as 40 percent of Hollywood's total domestic box office receipts for a year. Neither Paramount nor Marvel issued first-day figures for ""Iron Man."" But two box office tracking services, Media By Numbers and Box Office Mojo, both reported the film's estimated Friday take at $32.5 million, not including receipts from Thursday night ""preview"" screenings in more than 2,000 theaters. Media By Numbers estimated preview grosses at about $6 million; Box Office Mojo put that number at $5.5 million. ""Iron Man's"" opening Friday haul puts in on par with ""X2: X-Men United,"" which grossed $31.2 million its first Friday and went on to amass $85.6 million in receipts through its first Sunday, all in the same May weekend five years ago. If Friday's estimates hold up, Media By Numbers president Paul Dergarabedian said he expects ""Iron Man"" to best ""X2"" and perhaps even meet or surpass the $88.2 million grossed by ""Spider-Man 2"" in its first weekend in July 2004. ""It might be a little higher than 'X-2' because I think this one's going to have better word of mouth than that movie,"" Dergarabedian said. ""Whether it beats 'Spider-Man 2' remains to be seen."" ""Spider-Man 3"" holds the record for biggest opening weekend of all time, $151 million last May, while the first ""Spider-Man"" stands at No. 1 for a non-sequel film -- $114.8 million in the first weekend of May 2002."

en.15.65.318.2008.5.3,Bush details extra $70 billion for wars in next fiscal year,"Washington, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W. Bush on Friday laid out a detailed request for $70 billion to partially fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan while providing more aid to tackle an unfolding global food crisis. The president's request for the fiscal year starting October 1, originally made in February, includes $45.1 billion for combat operations for the two wars, $3.7 billion to help expand the Afghan forces and $2 billion for Iraqi troops. ""This request represents urgent and essential requirements,"" Bush said in a letter to U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congress is expected to provide the money. But Democrats, who have been pushing for a timetable to withdraw most of the 159,000 U.S. troops from Iraq, are considering attaching conditions that Bush may find objectionable. If Congress approves the additional money for this year and next, it will bring the total allocation for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to over $800 billion. The House could debate Bush's request next week. Most of the money would be used to fund the wars after October 1 and into next year, when a new president will be in office. Congress is likely to couple this bill with Bush's $108 billion request for the current fiscal year to cover additional war spending and related matters. One initiative Democrats are considering attaching to the funding bill is expanding educational benefits for veterans. The Bush administration is opposed, saying the initiative could encourage active duty soldiers to leave the military at a time when forces are stretched thin. Bush also urged Congress to approve $350 million for Middle East peace efforts, including $200 million for the Palestinians on condition that no money goes to the militant group Hamas which refuses to accept Israel's right to exist. After years of inactivity on the Arab-Israeli peace front, Bush launched a new initiative last year with a Middle East conference in Annapolis, Maryland. SCANT MIDEAST HOPE He said at the time he aimed to secure a peace treaty and the creation of a Palestinian state before leaving office next January -- but there has been little sign he can succeed. Bush will travel to Israel in mid-May to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Jewish state. While there, he will try to jumpstart the faltering peace process. The budget request also includes $770 million in additional food aid donations that Bush unveiled on Thursday, including food vouchers, seeds and purchases in the developing world. Additional requests include: $2.2 billion for projected increased fuel costs for military and intelligence operations. $2.6 billion to transport and maintain Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (MRAP) used for U.S. forces in Iraq. $193.2 million in military and economic aid to Pakistan and to boost diplomatic activities in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and expand U.S. development operations there. $35.6 million for increased diplomatic security for Middle East peace missions as well as personnel in Sudan and Somalia. $15 million to help push forward the six-party talks focused on getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program."
en.15.65.100.2008.5.7,Deadly China child virus won`t be another SARS: doctor,"Beijing, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A prominent Chinese doctor said China's deadly hand, foot and mouth outbreak will not become another epidemic on the scale of the SARS virus, even as the numbers of reported cases mounted on Wednesday. Hand, foot and mouth is a common childhood illness, but the current outbreak has led to some 27 fatalities, mostly when linked with enterovirus 71 (EV71), which can cause a severe form of the disease, characterized by high fever, paralysis and meningitis. ""The situation is completely different from SARS,"" Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese expert on respiratory diseases, said in an article posted on the government Web site of southern Guangdong province, where SARS was discovered in 2002. ""At present, the disease has already been diagnosed and there is proper prevention, so it will not evolve into a SARS-like epidemic."" Xinhua put the number of cases of hand, foot and mouth at 15,799, up from about 12,000 cases reported on Tuesday, though it was not clear whether the jump was due to the disease's spread or more thorough reporting. China initially covered up the SARS outbreak in 2003, a scandal which led to the sacking of the health minister and Beijing's mayor. A two-year-old girl in the central province of Hunan has become the latest to die of the EV71 strain, the official Xinhua news agency reported. It was the first reported death in that area. The outbreak has centered on Fuyang, in the poor, eastern province of Anhui, but Xinhua said the city had seen no fatalities for the past five days, suggesting the situation there was stabilizing. The China Daily has blamed the hand, foot and mouth crisis on a ""delayed reaction"" by Fuyang authorities, and on Wednesday it reported that the Anhui government had punished 10 doctors for malpractice relating to the outbreak. In one of the cases, two doctors were given demerits for delaying the transfer of a patient to a larger, county hospital after he was found to be suffering a high fever. In another, a doctor was fined for giving 17 children an injection he claimed could prevent EV71. There are no vaccines or antiviral agents available to prevent the virus. Health officials have cautioned that the outbreak has yet to peak, saying its high season is usually June and July. In Beijing, host city of the August Olympics, two kindergartens were temporarily closed after children showed symptoms of hand, foot and mouth, but the Beijing News reported that laboratory tests had not yet confirmed whether it was the EV71 strain. At least one international school in Beijing has also sent out a notice regarding the outbreak, warning parents to watch for signs of tiredness, fever and blisters and saying that in line with usual practice those with fever should be kept at home."

""The United States is donating an additional $40 million worth of food aid to Bangladesh,"" US ambassador to Bangladesh James F Moriarty told reporters at a press conference at the American Club Sunday. Of the total, $30 million will be used for a feeding programme for 350,000 schoolchildren in three years. The rest $10 million in emergency food aid will be allocated to the victims of the Nov 15 cyclone Sidr. ""This assistance will help us adavnce 3Dsdemocracy, development and denial of space to terrorists,"" Moriarty said. ""There is $30 million to be distributed over a three-year period that targets schoolchildren throughout the country via a school feeding programme,"" he said. ""The primary beneficiaries of the new $10 million emergency food aid will be those still struggling to recover from the devastating effects of cyclone Sidr,"" he said. Moriarty read out a written statement on the food aid and left the venue authorising USAID's mission director Denise Rollins to take questions from reporters. Rollins said the $40 million aid was part of $2.3 billion announced by the US government in humanitarian assistance. ""Humanitarian assistance and the development assistance are interrelated,"" Rollins bdnews24.com in reply to a question whether it was humanitarian aid or assistance on the condition of implementing 3Ds. ""All parts we are trying to encourage democracy, build a democratic space so that you can have a free, fair and fully participatory election."" ""As the ambassador mentioned about denying space to terrorists, if people are hungry they might tend to be more vulnerable to different elements of the society,"" she said. Rollins attributed the global price hike of food grains to the increased population of India and China. She said the US policy of producing biofuels from the edible grains was ""part"" of the reason for price hikes. ""There is no shortage of foods in Bangladesh. The problem is accessibility,"" Rollins said. She made it clear that a greater portion of the food aid would be channelled through government agencies. For school feeding programmes, high-protein biscuits would be distributed among school children. The USAID is one of the leading food aid agencies. The agency provided $5 billion in assistance since 1972, according to the USAID. It said it donated food aid worth $2.5 billion since Bangladesh's independence. bdn"
en.15.65.460.2008.5.1,Ten U.S. diplomats told to leave Belarus,"Wed Apr 30, MINSK (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Ten U.S. diplomats were ordered to leave Belarus within 72 hours on Wednesday, intensifying a dispute over sanctions and human rights in the former Soviet republic. U.S. charge d'affaires Jonathan Moore, speaking to reporters after being summoned to the Foreign Ministry, said the embassy would abide by orders from Belarussian authorities. The U.S. State Department called the move unjustified and unwarranted, but gave no hint whether Washington would retaliate. Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, in power since 1994, has long been accused of crushing freedom of speech and assembly. He has been barred from both the United States and European Union on allegations he rigged his 2006 re-election. Moore said he believed new sanctions would be introduced if Belarus did not release all detainees deemed to be political prisoners. ""Yes. I believe it will be soon,"" he said. Belarussian authorities said Washington had failed to comply with a demand to reduce its embassy's staff, the second this year. ""The Foreign Ministry provided a list of 10 diplomats which must leave the country in the course of 72 hours,"" Moore said. He said 15 diplomats were now in Minsk. ""We will do everything possible so that the U.S. diplomats leave the country within the required time limit."" The Belarussian Foreign Ministry's Internet site said a note had been issued to Moore about the demand to reduce embassy staff from 17 to six. The U.S. ambassador left the country last month at the urging of authorities, and another diplomat had also gone. Denouncing the move as unjustified, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said: ""We are considering our response to this action."" The United States wants to have a good relationship with Belarus, McCormack told reporters, ""but we are not going to do that and sacrifice the principles of pushing for freedom of expression, political freedoms, and other freedoms in Belarus."" He said there were currently just five diplomats at Belarus' embassy in Washington. PRISONERS, SANCTIONS U.S. officials have said a resumption of dialogue is possible only if Belarus releases its most prominent detainee, academic Alexander Kozulin, jailed for 5 1/2 years for helping stage mass protests against the president's re-election. Lukashenko ruled out any release of Kozulin on Tuesday in his annual state of the nation address to parliament. Kozulin turned down an offer last year to go to Germany for treatment of his ailing wife on the grounds it amounted to going into exile. His wife has since died. McCormack on Wednesday also repeated a U.S. call for Belarus to release a U.S. citizen, Emanuel Zeltser, who was imprisoned upon arrival in the country last month and charged with fraud. The New York-based lawyer, an emigre from the old Soviet Union, is being held in a Belarus psychiatric hospital. Belarus has been particularly unhappy about U.S. sanctions against oil products company Belneftekhim. Last month, it accused Washington of extending punitive measures against the firm, which accounts for about a third of Belarus' foreign currency earnings, and asked U.S. Ambassador Karen Stewart to leave. Washington denied there had been any such extension of sanctions, just a ""clarification."" After quarreling with traditional ally Russia last year over energy prices, Lukashenko tried to improve ties with the West, particularly the European Union. The United States and the EU denounced the jailing last week of two activists who took part in a January protest on the grounds they had assaulted security forces."

""Workers would have helped take the industry forward with more enthusiasm if the factories had been labour-friendly,"" the adviser said at a seminar on ""export growth and compliance: the case of Bangladesh knitwear sector"". Adviser Anwarul Iqbal said the government would offer all-out support to set up labour-friendly factories. The government had earlier asked Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) and Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) to increase facilities for workers. ""The government will take steps in this regard too,"" the adviser said. One million people, 70 percent of them women, work in the knitwear sector under direct employment and five million under indirect employment, BKMEA vice president MA Baset said. Iqbal stressed the need for launching a rationing system for knitwear workers as the spiralling prices of commodities hit hard the low-income group. BKMEA president Fazlul Hoque said the association would start a rationing system Monday. In the initial stage, the rationing programme would work in Fatullah in Narayanganj and BISIC industrial area. He said the BKMEA would revise worker wages in a couple of months. Baset, who presented a paper on export growth, said the knitwear sector of Bangladesh, grabbed the biggest pie of Bangladesh exports with an average growth rate of 20 percent in the last 10 years. The knitwear export earned the country $3.47 billion in the first eight months of the current fiscal year, he said. Readymade garments contributed $9.12 billion or 75.64 percent in the national export earnings in fiscal 2006-07 and $6.76 billion or 76.23 percent in the first eight months of the current fiscal year, Baset said. The labour and employment ministry and BKMEA organised the seminar at Osmani Memorial Hall. Baset said the BKMEA was working hard for further development of compliance issues of this sector. bdnews"
en.15.65.237.2008.5.6,Asia calls for funding to fight food shock amid tension,"Mon May 5, MADRID (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Over a billion Asians may sink back into extreme poverty without extra aid to counter soaring food prices, the region's development bank warned on Monday as a battle brewed over who would fund its spending. The call for cash to secure food supplies for Asia -- home to two thirds of the world's poor -- was accompanied by debate on whether developing countries or rapidly expanding nations like China and India should foot the bill. There was also tension over who was responsible for a more than 40 percent rise in global food prices in the year to March that has triggered violent riots in Africa and Asia. ""The global fight against poverty will be won or lost in our region,"" Asian Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda said in a keynote speech to delegates at the bank's annual meeting. Asia risks rising social tension as a doubling of wheat and rice prices in the last year slams poor families who spend more than half their income on food, Japan's finance minister warned. With grain stocks at their lowest levels in decades, turmoil in global financial markets and an uncertain outlook for the world economy, Kuroda made a plea for ""money and ideas"" to boost development and rescue millions from hunger and malnutrition. ""The absence of such measures could seriously undermine the global fight against poverty and erode the gains of the past decades,"" he said. POOR LEFT TO HELP POOR? The call for action was accompanied by requests to rapidly accelerate the ADB's investment program, particularly its core portfolio of infrastructure project lending, funded by loans linked to market interest rates. The 67 economies which fund the ADB -- 48 from the Asia Pacific region -- broadly agree that solving the food crisis will require short term emergency finance as well as long term loans and technical support to raise agricultural productivity. Sources inside the ADB say to meet soaring demand for assistance, the Bank must substantially increase its capital base from its current $56 billion. If it doesn't, the ADB's core non-concessional lending activity -- some $8.2 billion of the $10.1 billion it invested in total in 2007 -- risks being slashed. The United States, the ADB's second largest donor, was non-committal when asked about the need to increase funding. Washington has criticized the ADB for failing to focus lending on the very poor, its lack of accountability and investing too heavily in Asia's middle-income economies. ""We don't have analytical justification as to whether capital increase is necessary or not,"" Clay Lowery, U.S. Assistant Secretary of International Affairs at the Department of Treasury, told Reuters. India said the ADB urgently needed extra funds if it was to cut poverty among the 1.5 billion people in Asia-Pacific living on less than $2 a day -- a number three times the population of Europe. ""We seem to moving into an era where increasingly poor countries will be asked to help out their poor brethren,"" said Indian Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram. Asian officials say the United States would like countries like China and India to provide a bigger chunk of ADB funding, given they are some of the world's fastest growing economies. Asian countries at the ADB meeting have blamed one another for exacerbating price inflation by resorting to export restrictions, subsidies and food imports. Tensions over the food crisis bubbled to the surface in India on Monday after a remark by U.S. President George W. Bush that the Asian country's growing middle class is partly responsible for rising prices after demanding better nutrition. Unease with the ADB's lending activities was evident in the Philippines capital Manila, the Bank's headquarters, where around two dozen people demonstrated against its role in privatization deals and blamed the lender for failing to do more to combat rising food prices. ""In its 41 years of existence, the ADB has brought very little development to poor countries in the region, but left them heavily indebted,"" Eman Hizon, one of the protesters, told Reuters."
en.15.65.382.2008.5.3,African Dev. Bank pledges $1 billion more in food aid,"Washington, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The African Development Bank pledged $1 billion more for food aid on Friday as soaring commodity prices raise fears of famine, and it urged grain-exporting countries not to restrict shipments. The bank said in a statement that its agriculture portfolio will grow to $4.8 billion, and it was restructuring a portion of that to free up $250 million to be used more quickly. Wheat and other food prices soared to record highs this year because of strong global demand, unfavorable growing conditions in many regions, ethanol production that diverted a large portion of the U.S. corn crop, and investors pouring money into commodities markets. The World Bank and other international aid agencies have urged more funding for food aid. U.S. President George W. Bush called for $770 million in new food aid donations and other measures on Thursday. Countries including India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Brazil have imposed curbs on food exports in a bid to secure domestic supplies and limit inflation. The African Development Bank said stopping exports ""will compromise the existence of about 150 million people in a dozen African states"" and urged countries not to restrict shipments."

""It will be tough to sustain in the age of globalisation without research information. Considering this issue, we have taken the initiative to reshuffle the organisation. BFTI will help the government as well as the private sector with the knowledge of research,"" he said. Rahman said: ""Bangladesh has changed a lot. We want to be more a trade- dependent than an aid-dependent country. Because of this, we are paying attention to the increase of exports and imports in the world market and doing research for new markets. He expressed the hope that BFTI would grow to be a leading research institute in no time. Others present at the press conference were commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed (vice-chairman of BFTI), FBCCI president Annisul Huq (vice-chairman), MA Taslim (member secretary/CEO), BGMEA president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury (member) and BTMA chairman Abdul Hye Sarkar (member). The adviser said that the EC would provide 7.5 million euros while the government would provide 0.7 million euros. ""Research activity of the BFTI will increase thanks to MA Taslim and Mustafa Abid Khan,"" he said. Taslim said, ""BFTI will supply necessary data to the public and private sectors so that they could work together and create a bridge for development of trade. ""This kind of initiative is the first in the country and Bangladesh will very soon benefit from it,"" he said. Firoz Ahmed said: ""Though this organisation will initially run with financial grants from the EC and the government, it will eventually conduct its activities with its own earnings."" Taslim is also a member of the Bangladesh Better Business Forum, headed by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. bdnews24.c"
en.15.65.75.2008.5.3,World powers urge Arabs to honor Palestinian pledges,"London, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World powers called on Friday on Arab states to honor their financial and political pledges to help the Palestinians in their US-backed Middle East peace effort with Israel. The Quartet of Middle East peace mediators, which comprises the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States, also called on Israel to freeze all settlement building and to dismantle outposts erected since March 2001 to prevent the collapse of the peace talks. ""The Quartet called for all donors to follow through on pledges made ... The Quartet encouraged the Arab states to fulfill both their political and financial roles in support of the Annapolis process,"" it said after talks in London. U.S. President George W. Bush announced the resumption of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority with fanfare at a November 27 conference in Annapolis, Maryland but the negotiations have since yielded no visible progress. Arab diplomats and foreign policy analysts suggest that the absence of tangible headway has disheartened Arab states, who are deeply skeptical of Bush's goal of achieving a peace deal by the end of this year. ""Let's remember this is not about the United States, this is ... for the Palestinian people,"" U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said when asked if Arab doubts about the U.S. peace push has made them reluctant to contribute. ""Clearly if you made a pledge, you ought to fulfill it,"" she added at a news conference before Quartet members were to meet with Arab states including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said the Palestinian Authority's need for money would grow more acute in the second half of this year and that donors need to ""step up with budget support"". ""We believe it is a real challenge for the motivation of the donor community that they need to see ... progress on the political track,"" he added. According to U.S. figures, of $717.1 million in budget aid for the Palestinians promised by Arab League members, only $153.2 million has been delivered, all of which came from three countries: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Algeria. In contrast, other donors -- chiefly the United States and European nations -- have disbursed $502.1 million of the $834.9 million they pledged, the U.S. figures showed. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said Kuwait had announced on Friday it would allocate $80 million of the $300 million it pledged in December as budget support. Fayyad said he was pleased because Kuwait had previously indicated all the money was to be used for development projects. SHIFT ON GAZA The Quartet also voiced ""deep concern"" over humanitarian conditions in Gaza, where Israel tightened its blockade after the Islamist Hamas movement seized power from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's more secular Fatah in June 2007. The major powers called for a shift in strategy toward Gaza, backing Egyptian efforts to broker an informal truce between Israel and Palestinian militants and to ease the embargo. Israel says the blockade is aimed at stopping rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas and other militant groups. Shortages of fuel, power and basic goods have strangled Gaza's economy and created a humanitarian crisis for its 1.5 million people. Fayyad said progress in the peace process continues to be slow. He said Israeli settlement building undercut the peace talks and Israeli raids on areas under Palestinian control undermine the Palestinian Authority's security forces. An Arab diplomat said many countries in the region were losing hope that Bush's peace effort was making headway. ""There is a sense of frustration that there aren't tangible dividends,"" said the diplomat, who asked not be named. Speaking as she flew to London, where she will also have talks on Iran and Kosovo, Rice said the two sides were making progress in their negotiations despite the public doubts. ""The fact that one can't see churning under the water I think has led people to believe that there is nothing --- no progress is being made,"" Rice said. ""And I just think it's not right. I think they are making progress."" She added: ""I think it is far too early to start (having) any sense of despair about the end of the year."" Rice was due to take part in a three-way meeting with Fayyad and Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni on Friday before going to Israel and the Palestinian territories this weekend."
en.15.65.426.2008.5.1,Pakistan coalition parties to hold more talks,"Dubai/Islamabad,May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leaders of Pakistan's coalition parties made progress in talks to save the month-old government on Wednesday but will meet again on Thursday to try and resolve remaining issues, officials said. Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif rushed to Dubai to meet Asif Ali Zardari after their aides failed to settle differences over reinstating judges deposed by President Pervez Musharraf during a period of emergency rule six months ago. Some officials of Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), or PML (N), have hinted their ministers could quit Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani's cabinet over the matter. Any coalition cracks would heighten concern that nuclear-armed Pakistan, a U.S. ally under Musharraf, will suffer prolonged political instability at a time of challenges from Islamist militants and acute economic problems. Sharif, overthrown by Musharraf in a 1999 military coup, wants the judges to be reinstated immediately as part of a strategy to drive Musharraf from office but the PPP leadership would like to avoid an early confrontation with the president. ""A lot of progress has been made ... There is consensus on most issues but difference of opinion on some legal and constitutional matters,"" Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, a senior minister and close aide to Sharif, told reporters in Dubai. ""The fact of the matter is that a final decision on the issue will be made tomorrow and I can say that very categorically,"" Khan said at the hotel where the two sides met for seven hours. Having defeated Musharraf's allies in a parliamentary election in February, Zardari -- who succeeded his late wife Benazir Bhutto as head of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) -- forged a post-election alliance with Sharif. REVIVE CHALLENGES Restoration of the judges could revive challenges to Musharraf's re-election by the last parliament while still army chief. The coalition parties aim to amend the constitution to strip Musharraf of presidential powers to dismiss the government, but Sharif and Zardari differ over how fast to move. The two vowed the PPP-led government would pass a resolution in parliament to bring back 60 judges within a month of the coalition taking office. The deadline passed on Wednesday, with Zardari in Dubai where he had gone to see his daughters. The PPP harbors reservations about some judges, notably Iftikhar Chaudhry, the Supreme Court Chief Justice whose defiance of Musharraf last year galvanized the opposition. Analysts say the PPP is cautious about restoring Chaudhry because last October he had admitted legal challenges to a pardon that Musharraf granted Bhutto and Zardari to allow them to return to Pakistan without fear of prosecution in a slew of graft cases they maintained were politically motivated. The PPP wants to link reinstatement of the judiciary to a constitutional reform package that will include measures to shorten the tenure of senior judges. Under such a formula, Chaudhry could be reinstated with honor and then immediately packed off to retirement. The alliance between the PPP and PML-N marked the first time Pakistan's two mainstream parties have come together to assert civilian rule in a country that has been run by generals like Musharraf for more than half the 61 years since its formation. Optimism over the political outlook after the February vote had helped the Karachi stock market hit a record high on April 21, but the index has since lost over three percent as investors registered worry over the deadlock on the judges"
en.15.65.343.2008.5.1,Bangladesh notches up cyclone alert,"Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com)  Tropical cyclone Nargis has moved closer to Yangon of Myanmar, only 650km away, the US Navy said in a Thursday bulletin. The weather office in Bangladesh Thursday issued local warning signal 4 for Cox's Bazar and Chittagong and distant warning signal 2 for Mongla port, a weather official said. Arjumand Habib, director of the Met office, told bdnews24.com that the cyclone was likely to cut its path through Myanmar coasts. The severe cyclonic storm over the east central Bay and adjoining west central Bay was centred about 765km south-southwest of Chittagong port, 685km south-southwest of Cox's Bazar port and 705km south of Mongla port. ""It is likely to intensify further and move in a northeasterly direction,"" the Meteorological Department said in its midday bulletin. Under the peripheral influence of the storm, the low-lying areas of the coastal districts of Cox's Bazar, Chittagong, Noakhali, Laxmipur, Bhola and their offshore islands and chars are likely to be inundated by storm surges as high as 5 feet above the normal astronomical tide. All fishing boats and trawlers over the north Bay have been advised to take shelter immediately. bdnews"
en.15.65.270.2008.5.6,Haiti riot instigators set deadline to install PM,"Les Cayes, Haiti,May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Slum leaders in the southern town of Les Cayes who started Haiti's recent food riots handed lawmakers an ultimatum on Monday to install a new government within a week or face more protests. Jean Rene Frazil, an organizer of last month's street demonstrations, told Haitian President Rene Preval and parliament that renewed protests could be more violent than last month's unrest across the impoverished Caribbean country. ""Preval and parliament have no more than one week to install a new prime minister and a new government,"" Frazil, 28, told Reuters. ""Otherwise, we'll take to the streets again and it will be much worse than what happened during the past protests."" Parliamentary leaders were not immediately available for comment on the threat. At least six people were killed in April in a week of unrest that spread from Les Cayes to the capital, Port-au-Prince, and other cities. Five of the deaths occurred in Les Cayes, where rock-throwing protesters clashed with UN peacekeepers and looted businesses and food warehouses. Days later, the Senate fired Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis, blaming him for failing to increase national food production and lower the cost of living. Preval nominated a possible successor, Inter-American Development Bank senior adviser Ericq Pierre, on April 27. He must be ratified by parliament. Haiti was among a number of poor nations struck by food riots as prices for rice, beans, flour and other staples skyrocketed due to rising demand in Asia, diversion of food crops for biofuels, bad weather and market speculation. 'WE CAN DO IT AGAIN IF NECESSARY' The unrest shook Preval's efforts to establish a stable democracy in Haiti, ravaged by political upheaval and brutal dictatorships since it overthrew French rule in a slave revolt more than 200 years ago. On April 12 Preval announced a plan to lower the price of rice by about 15 percent. But hungry Haitians, many of whom live on less than $2 a day, said the move was not enough. ""We did it last time and we can do it again if necessary,"" Frazil said angrily, referring to the early April protests, as he stood in the middle of about two dozen people in the slum of La Savane, where the deadly riots started. Several chanted anti-government slogans and promised to turn the town upside down if the deadline was not met. ""A new prime minister is long overdue,"" Jose Pierre, 30, said. ""When a starving population is angry, anything can happen. They'd better do something now before it's too late."" The seaside neighborhood of La Savane is the poorest slum in Haiti's southern region, where households often consist of large groups of people with too little to eat. ""I have 10 children. I cannot send them to school and I cannot feed them because I am not working,"" said Jacqueline Emile, 52. ""I would like the government to help me."" Slum leaders called on Preval to set up community food warehouses and canteens, professional schools, health centers and to create jobs for young people to help halt rising crime. ""Our decision is that our children should have a better future and should not inherit this situation of absolute destitution in which our fathers and mothers have lived and in which we are living today,"" Marc-Orel Sanon said. ""We'll fight to our last breath to change that."
en.15.65.492.2008.5.6,BB talks tough on interest rates,"Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  The central bank will not issue banks licences to open new branches if they do not cut interest rates by next two months, a senior Bangladesh Bank official said Tuesday. Deputy governor Nazrul Huda said at a press briefing that the Bangladesh Bank had decided not to issue licences for new branches on non-compliance. Huda said they had had a series of talks with bankers on lowering interest rates and reviewing service charges. ""They (bankers) promised to lower the spread (difference between interest rates of deposit and loan) to 5 percent with no cuts in deposit interest rates by three months and revise the service charges as well,"" he added. Huda said one month of the promised period to cut the rates has passed. ""Bangladesh Bank would not issue licences for opening new branches if the rate cuts do not come by next two months,"" he said. Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed told reporters Saturday that they could not just ask the banks to lower the rates. Talks were held with bankers and they agreed to make an arrangement. Measures will be taken against banks with regard to opening of foreign exchange branches (AD branch) and other issues, Huda said at the briefing held on the central bank premises in Motijheel in the city. The deputy governor said the decision to press banks to lower interest rates was in line with the recommendations of the Bangladesh Better Business Forum (BBBF) headed by the chief adviser. ""We are not forcing bankers to do this but creating moral pressure in line with the BBF's suggestions. But we will have to exercise our power for (the banks) not complying with the issue and not revising the service charges,"" he said. bdnews"
en.15.65.260.2008.5.5,Top US officer says would prefer no war on Iran,"Jerusalem Mon May 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq would make it difficult to mount any attack on Iran, the Pentagon's top officer said in remarks broadcast on Monday, adding that he would prefer to avoid a new regional war. ""I actually am very hopeful that we don't get into a position where we have to get into a conflict,"" Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Israel's Channel Ten television when asked if he might recommend that US forces strike Iranian nuclear facilities preemptively. ""It would be a very significant challenge for the United States right now to get into a third conflict in that part of the world,"" Mullen added, referring to the Bush administration's long-running military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Washington is leading efforts to curb Iran's nuclear plans through UN Security Council sanctions, but has also hinted that war could be a last resort for denying Tehran -- which insists it seeks atomic energy only -- the means to make a bomb. Jittery since Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's 2005 call for the Jewish state to be ""wiped off the map"", Israeli officials have been lobbying for a tougher global stand against their arch-foe. ""I certainly share the concern about Iran and about the leadership, and I think it is very important that we increase as much as possible the financial pressure, the diplomatic pressure, the political pressure, and at the same time keep all the military options on the table,"" Mullen said. Believed to have the Middle East's only atomic arsenal, Israel bombed Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981. Israeli war planes also destroyed a site in Syria last September which US officials said was that of a secret nuclear program, though Damascus denied having any such facility. ""Certainly the situation with Syria is a troubling one and the development of this nuclear reactor was a troubling one indeed, and it is also indicative of what can be done out of the sight of people,"" Mullen said. ""You just can't be sure whether someone isn't developing one somewhere else."" Speculation that Israel could attack Iranian nuclear sites alone has been offset by assessments that its armed forces are too limited for the task. Iran is widely expected to retaliate for any such strike by targeting Israel and US assets in the Gulf"

First-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose to 7.12 billion crowns ($1.49 billion) from 7.04 billion a year earlier and were below an average forecast of 7.34 billion in a Reuters poll of 16 analysts. ""In the first quarter of 2008 we saw continued underlying revenue growth combined with a stable EBITDA margin,"" Chief Executive Jon Fredrik Baksaas said in a statement. ""The appreciation of the Norwegian crown puts pressure on our reported revenue growth,"" he added. The company reiterated its guidance for 2008 revenue growth of around 5 per cent, an EBITDA margin before other income and expenses above 31 per cent and capital expenditure equal to about 20 per cent of revenue. Telenor, which has expanded strongly into the emerging markets of eastern Europe and Asia, has been reporting figures without a contribution from Ukrainian operator Kyivstar due to a legal row with co-owner Altimo, part of billionaire Mikhail Friedman's Alfa Group. But Telenor said Kyivstar continued to perform well, with first-quarter EBITDA up to 1.86 billion crowns from 1.69 billion and the EBITDA margin up to 60.3 per cent from 59.6 per cent. Core earnings slipped in its home market Norwegian mobile and fixed-line operations, rose in Sweden and fell in Denmark and Hungary. DTAC of Thailand saw a rise in EBITDA, but Grameenphone of Bangladesh saw its earnings fall slightly. ""In Asia, we see a more turbulent business environment with a significant increase in prices for basic goods, such as rice and fuel, affecting purchasing power,"" Baksaas added. ""In spite of these challenges, our operations are performing well this quarter. Strong competition and high market growth in Bangladesh will continue to put pressure on ARPU and margins in Grameenphone,"" he added. Telenor shares closed at 99.60 crowns on Tuesday, valuing the company at about $US32.6 billion. Trade on the Oslo bourse resumes at 1700 AEST."
en.15.65.327.2008.5.1,Viduka ruled out of Australia's World Cup qualifiers,"MELBOURNE, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia striker Mark Viduka has been ruled of his country's World Cup qualifiers in June with an Achille's heel injury, coach Pim Verbeek said on Thursday. The 32-year-old Newcastle United striker committed last month to helping Australia qualify for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, when he was fit. Verbeek, however, said Viduka would not be available for matches against Iraq in Brisbane and Dubai on June 1 and June 7 respectively, Qatar in Doha on June 14 and China in Sydney on June 22. ""He is struggling with an Achille's problem,"" Verbeek told reporters from the Netherlands on a conference call. ""They are thinking of rehab, having injections and maybe a small operation at the end of the season so I don't think he will be available. ""He was struggling and when we spoke he said he would see if he is (feeling) better and we would find out if he would be available (for June) but it is not going very well for him. ""It will be very difficult for him to be part of the group."" Verbeek reiterated that Australia's former captain was committed to ensuring his side qualified for South Africa. ""There is no doubt about it,"" the coach added. ""He was very positive and said that if he was fit then he would be available."" Liverpool forward Harry Kewell and Middlesbrough goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer had said they would also be available for the qualifiers, Verbeek said. Kewell who missed the qualifier against China in March with a groin strain, was fit and training, though not playing, while Schwarzer had recovered from a shoulder injury, Verbeek said. He expected Kewell, who has already committed to playing Australia's friendly against Ghana in Sydney on May 23, to play all of the qualifiers. Verbeek said that four players, Lucas Neill, Jacob Burns, Mile Sterjovksi and Josh Kennedy, were also expecting their partners to give birth to children in June and could also potentially miss matches"

Stanford, who has offered a multi-million pounds investment proposal to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), said he envisaged international teams playing alongside counties in the new competition. ""If I was doing this (alone) I would bring it in next year,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""If the ECB do not get this programme in place by 2010 they have missed the boat. That is the latest they can possibly be."" ECB officials have dismissed suggestions the new competition, a response to the lucrative IPL which has attracted players from across the globe, will operate with city franchises rather than the traditional county teams. The board are expected to announce details of their plans by the end of the month. Stanford, who owns several companies in the Caribbean and already finances a Twenty20 event on the islands, said the ECB model could combine franchises and county sides. ""I think the county format gives you the best structure,"" he said. ""It has been there a long time. It works...it is the basis it (the new league) builds from. ""Now (it is a question) whether you build on that county structure and take that into a city structure which may be on some people's minds from a commercial aspect. ""You might have say Kent v Liverpool or something like that and maybe create more rivalry."" Stanford said international teams may also play a role. TV REVENUE ""Absolutely. That brings the crowds in, that makes it international, brings television revenue in, I think that is a given,"" he said. While urging the ECB to move fast over the new league, he said he was pleased the board had not rushed in too quickly. ""English cricket sometimes works slower than the rest of the modern sports world does but sometimes that is good, as long as you don't move too slow,"" he said. Stanford said the IPL had been created too quick and was sure Twenty20 was ready to go global. ""With the right money, organisation and goals in place it can be an Olympic sport within a 10-year span,"" he said. ""We want to be the dominant team sport in the world, we want to bring it to the U.S., take it into markets where it hasn't been before and take it back into markets like the UK.

en.15.65.330.2008.5.1,Moscow finale never in doubt for Drogba,"LONDON, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Didier Drogba said he was never in any doubt that Chelsea's season would end in Moscow. The Ivory Coast striker struck twice on Wednesday to earn the Blues a 3-2 victory over Liverpool and set up a Champions League final against Manchester United. Avram Grant's side could still arrive in the Russian capital looking for an unlikely double, should United wobble in their final two Premier League games. However, Drogba said this season's focus had always been on elevating Chelsea into the elite club of Champions League winners, a mission that has not wavered despite the shock early-season exit of popular coach Jose Mourinho. Mourinho departed after a disappointing 1-1 home draw with Rosenborg Trondheim in September, Chelsea's opening match on their Champions League journey. ""Right from the beginning of the season the Champions League was our target,"" Drogba, who is Chelsea's record scorer in the competition with 18, told reporters. ""Okay we had some problems this season. It was a difficult time for the club. But the most important thing was to stand up and keep working as we did. The objective didn't change and now we are in the final. ""United are a fantastic team and are the best in England, but we aren't bad either."" Drogba has experienced a big European showpiece occasion before when he was on the losing Marseille side against Valencia in the 2004 UEFA Cup final. BREAKING GROUND While most of the squad will be breaking new ground on May 21, Paulo Ferreira, Ricardo Carvalho and Claude Makelele already know what it feels like to win the Champions League. Carvalho and Ferreira were part of the Porto side that won the trophy in 2004 under Jose Mourinho while 35-year-old Makelele, who applied a stranglehold on Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard on Wednesday, won it in 2002 for Real Madrid. Michael Ballack, who is beginning to show his best at Chelsea, was in the Bayer Leverkusen side that lost to Real so will also have a huge incentive to claim a winners' medal. Carvalho returned from a goal-conceding mistake against Manchester United on Saturday with a typically assured performance against Liverpool and believes the momentum is swinging Chelsea's way as the season reaches its climax. ""The (league) victory over United has given us a great deal of confidence,"" he told reporters. ""First we have to win our last two league games and hope United make a mistake. ""Once we get to Moscow it will be a one-off. We have great players and a strong mentality and we will have to show in one game that we are better than them."

The mainly Muslim country is considering requiring women to obtain the written consent of their families or employers before being allowed to travel alone outside the country, state news agency Bernama said on Saturday, quoting the foreign minister. ""It is totally ridiculous and it's a totally regressive proposal with regards to women's right to movement,"" said Norhayati Kaprawi, spokeswoman for Sisters in Islam. The National Council for Women's Organisations called it unfair. ""This is an infringement of our rights,"" council deputy president Faridah Khalid told the New Sunday Times. The foreign and home ministries came up with the idea in response to a string of cases where women traveling alone were used by international drug syndicates to smuggle drugs across borders, Bernama said, quoting Foreign Minister Rais Yatim. Bernama portrayed the proposal as an anti-crime measure rather than a religiously inspired idea and said it aimed to ensure that a woman's family would ""monitor her departure and serve as a preventive measure against being duped"". Rais was quoted as saying that the idea came out of a review of criminal cases involving Malaysians abroad. In 119 cases of Malaysian women being brought before foreign courts, about 90 percent were linked to drugs, he told reporters. Asked if it suspected a hidden religious motive, Sisters in Islam declined to speculate and said the proposal assumed women were less capable than men of making decisions for themselves. ""Only Dr Rais Yatim knows whether it is based on his understanding of Islam or because of his lack of understanding of gender issues,"" Norhayati said. ""It will definitely not solve the problem,"" she added, noting that many Malaysian men were also duped into smuggling drugs."

en.15.65.9.2008.5.4,Lindsay Lohan mug shot launches drunk driving ad,"Fri May 2, LOS ANGELES (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - A U.S. restaurant and liquor group used a mug shot of troubled actress Lindsay Lohan on Friday to launch a national campaign against the use of new technology aimed at keeping drunks off the road. A full page advertisement in the newspaper USA Today used the police shot of Lohan after her arrest in Los Angeles last year for drunken driving under a caption saying ""Ignition interlocks. A good idea for:"" (Lohan) ""But a bad idea for us:"" showing pictures of adults drinking at weddings and restaurants. The ad says ignition interlocks, which prevent intoxicated drivers from starting their cars, are ""a great tool for getting hard-core drunk drivers off our roads."" But putting one in every person's car, as some people advocate, ""means an end to moderate and responsible drinking prior to driving ..."", the ad says. Lohan, now 21, became a poster child for under-age drinking last year when she checked into rehab three times and was arrested and briefly jailed for drunken driving and cocaine possession. The ""Freaky Friday"" and ""Mean Girls"" star has since kept mostly out of trouble. Lohan's lawyer Blair Berk said on Friday that the actress ""fully endorses ignition interlock devices."" But in her statement, Berk added that it was irresponsible to suggest that drinking and driving ""is some kind of American 'tradition' we should protect."" The advertisement was paid for by Web site www.interlockfacts.com, which is described as a ""special project"" of the American Beverage Institute. The ABI is a restaurant trade association with strong links to U.S. wine, beer and spirits suppliers that promotes responsible drinking by adults. The ABI said it planned to use the mug shots of other celebrities arrested for drunken driving in further campaigns but did not give details. ""These are public images. A lot of publications have used this (Lohan) shot. We are not worried about any legal fallout,"" ABI managing director Sarah Longwell told Reuters. Longwell said the campaign was aimed at highlighting moves in the United States to incorporate interlocking technology into all cars to stop drunken driving. Nine U.S. states have passed laws allowing the installation of in-car breathalyzers used to lock ignition switches into cars of those who have been convicted of first time drunk driving. The federal government has also funded a research program into other devices."
en.15.65.317.2008.5.3,Hunger stalks globe as aid groups forced to cut,"Washington, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Strained aid groups are already cutting food assistance to hundreds of thousands of people the world over, raising fears they will be powerless to stem rising hunger in the most vulnerable countries. The reduction in food aid is a consequence of the dramatic surge in global food and fuel prices, a trend that makes food more dear for the world's poor while eating into aid budgets. Atlanta-based CARE has cut the size of its rations to the 660,000 people it feeds in Somalia, and warns that it needs an extra $25 million worth of food to feed more than 800,000 people through early August. ""Food stocks will run out mid to end of May ... Numbers of displaced people needing food grow daily and the cost of food keeps going up,"" said Alina Labrada, a CARE spokeswoman. Mercy Corps, which distributes baskets of sugar, rice and other food to Iraqi refugees in Syria, is agonizing over whether it will reduce ration sizes or cut needy families. In southern Sudan, World Vision now expects to feed 59,000 fewer people this year than it had originally planned. ""The reductions are not just confined to one region,"" said Robert Zachritz, a senior World Vision official. Overall, global food prices jumped 43 percent in the year through March. That hurts the most in the developing world, where people typically spend over half their income on food. On Friday, southeast Asian trade officials met in Indonesia for talks on how to respond to soaring prices of rice, which have almost trebled this year in Asia. DONORS RESPOND The food crisis has donor countries scrambling to help the United Nations' World Food Program fill a funding gap of $755 million and keep aid donations on track this year. The Bush administration has already released aid from a crop trust, and this week announced $770 million in new food aid and farm development funds for next year. But the situation on the ground remains a grim one, especially as Africa's pre-harvest hungry season approaches, and many aid groups are already making difficult choices. ""This is an unprecedented crisis for us, because it's global,"" said Lisa Kuennen-Asfaw, of Catholic Relief Services -- a crisis felt in most of the 100 places CRS works. The crisis is an extra strain on the 850 million people considered ""chronically hungry"" even before the current crisis -- and officials say that number is sure to grow. Most vulnerable are the over 1 billion people who live on less $1 a day, the United Nations says. Many groups are still in talks with the U.S. Agency for International Development about the volume of wheat, soy or other foodstuff they'll get this year -- aid contracts are awarded in dollar terms -- but they fear the worst. CRS has already cut the tonnage of food it sends to Haiti by 12 percent. It's also scaling down a food aid program in India far faster than it had planned, and will feed 100,000 fewer people next year than was planned. ""It's very clear that this is not going to go away,"" said Bob Bell, a senior official at CARE. CARE and other aid groups, which typically rely on a mix of government, international, foundation, and individual donations, are scrambling to pull in greater private funding. As aid workers struggle to understand the extent of the problem in poor countries, some are also turning to little-used or new aid measures to minimize the impact of tight budgets. Those may include cash vouchers, cash-for-work programs, or subsidized fertilizer. LONG-TERM ATTENTION Mercy Corps has set up a special food crisis fund that it hopes will allow it to bypass the lengthy funding process and act quickly when hunger strikes, possibly providing farm tools, seeds or other agriculture inputs. ""That way there is a harvest later on ... We're trying to think creatively,"" said Penny Anderson, who heads food security for the group, which works in places like Afghanistan. Catholic Relief Services will work in coming months to help about 20,000 farmers in 10 countries get access to nitrogen fertilizer, hopefully allowing them to boost rice crops and have an option to costly imported rice. ""What I'm trying to focus on is seeing the silver lining in this cloud and how we can help poor farmers seize this opportunity,"" Tom Remington, who oversees Catholic Relief Services' agriculture work in Africa, said from his home in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso. Still, aid groups insist that the current crisis illustrates the need for major, sustained investment in transforming agriculture, especially in Africa. ""Food aid is an immediate solution, but it shouldn't be seen as a long-term solution,"" Zachritz said. ""Farmers in the developing world need access to credit, inputs and markets."" Above all, aid workers caution that agriculture investment must occur over many years, and say the world cannot lose interest when prices ebb and a new crisis takes center stage. ""Agriculture just doesn't turn on a dime like that,"" Remington said."
en.15.65.376.2008.5.3,White House hopefuls battle over gas tax holiday,"Hendersonville, North Carolina, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican John McCain hammered Democrat Barack Obama on Friday for refusing to support a proposal to suspend the federal gasoline tax. The U.S. economy and record-high gasoline prices took center stage after a Labor Department report said U.S. employers cut 20,000 jobs in April, the fourth straight month of job losses and a new sign that the economy is flirting with a recession. Clinton, fighting to overtake Obama's lead in North Carolina, criticized Obama for not backing a summer suspension of the 18.4-cent per gallon federal tax on gasoline to give Americans some relief during vacation season. Obama has said the proposed suspension would save each American family less than $30 and would not solve the long-term problem. Clinton attacked McCain for how he would make up the money raised by the gasoline tax. McCain would divert funds from general government revenues to pay for transportation projects funded by the tax; Clinton would levy a windfall profits tax on oil companies. ""Senator Obama doesn't want us to take down the gas tax this summer and Senator McCain wants us to, but he doesn't want to pay for it. I believe we should impose an excess profits tax on the oil companies,"" she said. McCain, at a town hall meeting in Denver, said the money would come from eliminating wasteful special interest projects that both Obama and Clinton have supported in the past. ""Let's give low-income Americans a break for the summer and realize maybe they deserve it, given the increase in food costs, given the increase in the cost of gasoline, given the increase in expenses particularly when most of them are on fixed income or even worse, having lost their jobs,"" he said. In Indianapolis, Obama castigated McCain and Clinton for backing the proposal, calling it an election-year gimmick. The idea has appeal for a U.S. public anxious about rising gas prices and the prospect of expensive road trips during the vacation season. But it has been rejected by many economists who believe the savings would end up in the pockets of oil companies already reaping record profits, instead of easing the burden on consumers. ""This isn't a real solution,"" Obama said. ""It's a political stunt. This is what Washington does whenever there's a big problem. Politicians pretend that they're looking out for you, but they're just looking out for their poll numbers."" North Carolina and Indiana hold nominating contests on Tuesday, the next votes in the process to determine whether Illinois Sen. Obama or New York Sen. Clinton will face Arizona Sen. McCain in the November presidential election. Clinton and Obama are locked in a close duel for the Democratic presidential nomination. He leads in nominating delegates, while she has moved into a virtual tie with him in national polls after winning in Pennsylvania last month. The Democrats' pick is nominated by delegates at the party's convention in August. Clinton is hoping that a month of problems for Obama, in particular a controversy over racially charged rhetoric by his former pastor, will undermine his credibility as an electable Democrat. At a news conference in Indianapolis, Obama acknowledged having ""a rough couple of weeks"" and predicted tight races in North Carolina and Indiana. ""This campaign has been tight throughout. But I am very confident that the American people are looking for the kind of truth-telling and serious policymaking that's going to have an impact on their lives and as long as I'm talking about the issues that matter to them, I think we've got a terrific chance,"" he said."

en.15.65.445.2008.5.4,Asia fears lost decade from food price shock,"MADRID, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Soaring food prices may throw millions of people back into poverty in Asia and undo a decade of gains, regional leaders said on Sunday while calling for increased agricultural production to meet rising demand. Asia - home to two thirds of the world's poor - risks rising social unrest as a doubling of wheat and rice prices in the last year has slammed people spending more than half their income on food, Japanese Finance Minister Fukushiro Nukaga said during the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting. If food prices rise 20 percent, 100 million poor people across Asia could be forced back into extreme poverty, warned Indian Finance Secretary D Subba Rao. ""In many countries that will mean the undoing of gains in poverty reduction achieved in the past decade of growth,"" Rao told the ADB's meeting in Madrid. A 43 percent rise in global food prices in the year to March sparked violent protests in Cameroon and Burkina Faso as well as rallies in Indonesia following reports of starvation deaths. Many governments have introduced food subsidies or export restrictions to counter rising costs, but they have only exacerbated price rises on global markets, Nukaga said. ""Those hardest hit are the poorest segments of the population, especially the urban poor,"" Nukaga told delegates. ""It will have a negative impact on their living standards and their nutrition, a situation that may lead to social unrest and distrust,"" he added. The ADB estimates the very poorest people in the Asia Pacific region spend 60 percent of their income on food and a further 15 percent on fuel -- the key basic commodities of life which have seen their prices rise relentlessly in the last year. POVERTY TIME BOMB Japan is one of 67 ADB member economies gathered in Spain to discuss measures to counter severe weather and rising demand that have ended decades of cheap food in developing nations. The Asia-Pacific has three times the population of Europe -- around 1.5 billion people -- living on less than $2 a day. Rice is a staple food in most Asian nations and any shortage threatens instability, making governments extremely sensitive to its price. Decade high inflation, driven by food and raw materials costs, has topped the agenda of the ADB's annual meeting. The Manila-based multilateral lender has had to defend itself from US criticism it is focused on middle income countries and has neglected Asia's rural and urban poor. Smaller countries such as Cambodia urged the ADB to focus its lending on the poorest Asian states. The Bank on Saturday called for immediate action from global governments to combat soaring food prices and twinned it with a pledge of fresh financial aid to help feed the Asia Pacific region's poorest nations. Leading members Japan, China and India backed long-term ADB strategy to provide low-cost credit and technical assistance to raise agricultural productivity. The United Nations said the rural poor represented a political time-bomb for Asia that could only be defused by higher agricultural investment and better technology. ""Unless you can look at the plight of the poorest farmers in the region and how they are going to add to the numbers of very poor, very deprived people, we are unnecessarily going to create a problem that will erupt into a political crisis,"" said Rajendra Pachauri, head of the UN panel on climate change"

The rampaging workers vandalised vehicles before withdrawing following discussion with the officials of the Department of Labour, leaders of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association and the administration. The workers of Orchid Sweater Factory of Azim Group in BSCIC industrial area in Chandgaon stayed off work Monday demanding a rise in wage and they were joined by the workers of Global Knitwear and Savar Knitwear of the group. The management and the workers' representatives met in the afternoon that day to thrash out a solution but could not reach a decision. The agitated workers, however, continued with the work abstention in the industrial area Tuesday and several thousand workers came out on the streets at about 9am. They damaged some vehicles and shops during the blockade, halting traffic on five-kilometre road from Bahaddarhat to Kalurghat. A workers' leader told bdnews24.com: ""A meeting was scheduled for the morning but when the workers came to the factory they found that three factories of Azim Group have been declared closed for indefinite period. Then the workers took to the street."" Anwar Hossain, a worker of Global Knitwear, alleged that the management was supposed to give them 'piece rate' at Tk 40 and tiffin bill at Tk 12. But, he alleged, it would give them Tk 24 and Tk 6 only. ""We resorted to agitation Monday to realize our just demands,"" he said. Officer-in-charge of Panchlaish Police Station Anisur Rahman Khan told bdnews24.com: ""The management was scheduled to hold a discussion with workers over their demands in the morning. But as the meeting did not take place, the workers of three factories of Azim Group took to the streets. ""Workers of the other factories in Kalurghat BSCIC industrial area joined them later,"" the OC said. Assistant commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police Mesbah Uddin said, ""The workers got agitated seeing the notice of factory closure and came down to the streets."" RAB and police were deployed in the area to keep order when the workers blockaded the road. BGMEA leaders and administration officials also came to the scene. ""Six platoons of police and armed police have been deployed there,"" Mesbah Uddin said. At about 1pm, Abdul Khaleque of the Labour Department, BGMEA vice president M Mohiuddin Chowdhury and Azim Group director Nawshah Ahmed spoke to the workers and sat a meeting that ended at 2pm. The owners agreed to accept some demands of the workers, who in turn withdrew the blockade at about 3pm.

en.15.65.488.2008.5.5,"Prodded by US, Olmert and Abbas meet privately","Jerusalem, Mon May 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met on Monday to try to accelerate peace talks that have shown little sign of progress ahead of a visit by US President George W Bush. The one-on-one meeting, which follows a visit by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, has been overshadowed by a new criminal investigation into Olmert's affairs that has some Israeli commentators questioning his political prospects. Olmert's office declined to comment ahead of the meeting at the prime minister's Jerusalem residence, where he was questioned on Friday by police over fresh allegations that were barred from publication under a court gag order. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Monday's talks would focus on negotiations on core issues, launched at a US-hosted international conference in Annapolis, Maryland in November, and on an Israeli obligation to halt Jewish settlement expansion. Rice said she still hoped to seal a statehood deal by the end of this year. Washington wants to see more progress before Bush visits Israel later this month to take part in ceremonies marking its 60th anniversary. But Israeli-Palestinian talks have been clouded by violence, primarily along the border of the Gaza Strip, and by Israel's expansion of settlements in the West Bank, which Palestinians fear will deny them a viable state. Rice called Jewish settlements in the West Bank ""particularly problematic"". A 2003 peace ""road map"" calls for Israel to halt construction in the settlements. Israel says it will keep major settlement blocs under any peace deal -- a plan tacitly endorsed by US President George W Bush in 2004 -- and recently approved new housing projects in the enclaves. The road map calls on the Palestinians to rein in militants. Rice on Sunday stepped up pressure on Israel to ease travel restrictions on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, where Abbas's government holds sway. Hamas Islamists took over Gaza last June. After Rice's last trip in late March, Israel said it planned to remove 61 barriers in the West Bank. But a UN survey subsequently found that only 44 obstacles had been scrapped -- and that most of these were of little or no significance. Israel says its network of hundreds of barriers in the West Bank prevent suicide bombings. Palestinians view them as collective punishment and a blight on their economy"

""The recent events which involved Ronaldo are personal and do not put at risk any of the forward's publicity contracts with his sponsors, nor give them grounds to cancel the contracts,"" said a statement on the player's Web site (www.ronaldo.com). Ronaldo's agent Fabiano Farah was quoted as saying: ""For a contract to be cancelled, Ronaldo has to be publicly condemned. But he hasn't committed any crime, nor broken any law. ""On the contrary. He is the only victim in the case."" Police say Ronaldo, who is recovering from a serious knee injury, was involved in an altercation with three transvestites late on Sunday in the Rio de Janeiro neighbourhood of Barra da Tijuca. The transvestites and Ronaldo were all interviewed by police on Monday. Nobody has been charged but police detective Carlos Augusto Nogueira said one of the transvestites, known as Andreia, may be charged with trying to extort money from Ronaldo and stealing his driving licence. Ronaldo, 31, suffered a career-threatening knee injury during a Serie A game against Livorno in February. The three-times World Player of the Year has since said he is determined to resume his career. Ronaldo, who has not played for Brazil since the 2006 World Cup, is undergoing three sessions of physiotherapy a day. His recovery is expected to take at least another seven months"

en.15.65.168.2008.5.7,"Russia swears in new leader, but will he be boss?","Moscow, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thirty guns will salute Dmitry Medvedev on Wednesday, when he is sworn in as a new Russian president in the Kremlin's throne room to replace his long-time mentor, the powerful Vladimir Putin. But many of the 2,000 invited dignitaries at the lavish ceremony will be trying to guess if the 55-year-old ex-KGB spy, who has led Russia's revival for eight years, is ready to step back and let the 42-year-old ex-lawyer rule the country. Putin has named Medvedev as a preferred successor ensuring his victory in the March polls with 72 percent of vote. But the Kremlin leader, who will become Medvedev's prime minister, has also said he will retain political influence after quitting while promising not to change the balance of power between president and government. Officials and media have said the inauguration in the Grand Kremlin Palace will follow the pattern set for a similar ceremony in 2000, when Putin was sworn in, to stress continuity and smooth transition of power. Eight years ago, Putin's long ceremonial march through golden Kremlin halls captured for many ordinary Russians the glory of the Russian state. Medvedev will also march to the Kremlin's gold-and-white St Andrew's hall to take the oath and make a brief speech to the nation in a ceremony due to start at 11:40 a.m. (0740 GMT). But Russian media has said that unlike in 2000, the new president is likely to be preceded by Putin who will take the same path and make a speech in a gesture putting him on an equal footing with his successor. After the ceremony accompanied by an artillery salute, Putin and Medvedev will watch a parade by the Kremlin guards. SHARING POWER Putin has said Medvedev, who had spearheaded ambitious social projects designed to translate Russia's new wealth into a better life for millions, is the right man to head Russia. The constitution, adopted under Yeltsin, gives a president strong powers, including the right to define Russia's foreign and domestic policy, appoint key ministers and control key security and defense agencies. Putin, in his time in office, further boosted Kremlin power by assuming the right to name hitherto elected regional leaders and seizing control of parliament through the pro-Kremlin United Russia party. The party holds a two-thirds majority in the lower house. Putin has said he sees no problem working with Medvedev with whom he shares views on Russia's future. But Russia's history knows few examples of such smooth coexistence. Short-lived rivalries between Yeltsin and his powerful prime ministers usually ended in the resignations of the latter. Putin has preferred technical, and weak, premiers. But when he is confirmed as a new prime minister by parliament on Thursday and lands in his new riverside office in central Moscow, the picture is sure to change dramatically. Putin, who has presided over eight years of uninterrupted economic growth, has said he will focus on making Russia one of the top seven global economies by 2020. He has promised not to seek any extra powers. But in a sign that he is not going to let political levers out of his hands, Putin has agreed to head United Russia winning a strong instrument of control over the new president. Eight years ago, the departing Yeltsin left Putin a pen with which he used to sign laws as a symbol of a handover of power. Putin said in a newspaper interview last month, he would take the historic pen with him rather than leave if to Medvedev."

Sebastian Battaglia scored the only goal to throw the Apertura championship wide open, moving Boca one point behind leading trio River, Estudiantes and San Lorenzo with six matches to play. Estudiantes, who top the table on goals scored from River, lost 2-1 at Argentinos Juniors on Saturday while San Lorenzo won 2-1 at Gimnasia-La Plata. The three teams have 27 points from 13 games. Boca dominated the early stages at the Bombonera and Rodrigo Palacio wasted an excellent chance when he broke clear but shot straight at Juan Carrizo. The hosts went ahead in the 14th minute when midfielder Battaglia shook off his marker to meet Juan Roman Riquelme's corner with a powerful header. ""Boca deserved to win because River did nothing,"" said Riquelme. Boca previously beat River in May 2005 and the five meetings since then have produced three draws and two wins for River. Gabriel Hauche and Alejandro Delorte gave Argentinos a 2-0 lead against Estudiantes and Mauricio Carrasco pulled one back for Roberto Sensini's team. San Lorenzo won a game of controversial refereeing decisions. Federico Dominguez put Gimnasia ahead after half an hour by converting a hotly-disputed penalty awarded for hand ball. CONTROVERSIAL DECISION The hosts were on the wrong end of another controversial decision when Jorge San Esteban was sent off in the 48th minute for elbowing.

German Denis scored twice in the first half to set Independiente on their way to a 3-0 win over Newell's Old Boys in their last game under interim coach Miguel Santoro.

en.15.65.449.2008.4.30,Microsoft eyes Yahoo retention plan: court papers,"SAN FRANCISCO, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has considered earmarking $1.5 billion to retain Yahoo Inc employees if it acquires the company, according to court documents in a shareholder suit filed against Yahoo. The $1.5 billion figure was discussed in a communication between the general counsels of Microsoft and Yahoo, and came to light when a lawyer representing Yahoo mentioned the amount in a March 24 hearing in a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court. Edward Welch, the lawyer representing Yahoo, also said during the hearing that 1,000 layoffs Yahoo made in February were the only job cuts the company planned to make. ""There are no more reductions in force planned for the future,"" he said. Two Detroit pension funds have filed the shareholder action against Yahoo and its board of directors asserting that the Silicon Valley company has failed Yahoo shareholders by not responding in good faith to Microsoft's takeover offer. Plaintiffs firm Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP released a transcript of the hearing on its site here The details were first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. Separately, Microsoft is weighing nominating its own slate of directors for Yahoo's board while keeping its options open on putting a merger offer directly to shareholders, the Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The proxy slate move could come as early as Wednesday, it said. Microsoft had set a deadline of last Saturday for Yahoo to agree to its unsolicited $31 per share cash-and-stock offer but the two appear to have entered a standoff over deal terms. Yahoo has said Microsoft's $31-per-share initial takeover offer ""substantially undervalues"" the pioneering Web company and that it is considering a variety of alternatives. Microsoft's deal is currently valued at around $42 billion. Microsoft said last week it would declare its next moves in the takeover battle this week but has been quiet so far. Plaintiffs' attorney David Margules argued that a Yahoo staff retention plan of its own should be seen as an anti-takeover device rather than, as the company stated, an attempt to calm Yahoo employees who fear a Microsoft merger. Two weeks after Microsoft began its unsolicited bid for Yahoo, Yahoo put in place a change of control severance plan for any full-time employees laid off following a deal that would pay salaries for up to two years as severance pay. A poll published by Reuters over the weekend found an overwhelming majority of Wall Street analysts expect Microsoft to launch a hostile bid at its current price of $31 per share in cash and stock"

en.15.65.55.2008.5.3,Arrests of drunken British women on the rise,"LONDON, May 2 (Reuters Life!/bdnews24.com) - The number of British women arrested for being drunk and disorderly has risen by more than 50 percent in the past five years, and soared by over 1,000 percent in some areas, police figures showed on Friday. Campaigners said the rise in arrest figures reflect the deliberate targeting of women by pubs and clubs offering cheap drinks and free entry. Mike Craik, chief constable of Northumbria police in northern England, where such arrests rose by 48 percent to 2,101, called for action on pricing, a ban on advertising and increased regulation. ""There should also be an end to discounted drinks, such as two-for-one deals, happy hours and supermarkets selling alcohol at below cost prices,"" he told Channel 4 News Online. ""There should be a ban on the sale of alcopops and no advertising of alcohol. Consideration should be given to pricing which is relevant to its strength. The figures from 38 of the 52 UK police forces were collected by the station's online team. Of the 38 who responded, only 21 were able to provide like-for-like figures over the five-year period. Those showed a 53 percent increase in arrests, from 3,847 in 2003/4, to 5,891 in 2007/8. The Portman Group, a drinks industry organization which campaigns against alcohol abuse, said it takes its responsibility seriously and works within codes of conduct. It told Channel 4 that education rather than pricing was the key issue."
en.15.65.139.2008.5.1,Barca lose to United on player management,"MANCHESTER, England, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona's Champions League exit to Manchester United was a failure of team management, directors and club sources said. Barcelona, European champions in 2006, were beaten 1-0 on aggregate at Old Trafford on Tuesday with the blame being laid on poor management and discipline of some of the world's most gifted players. A side boasting Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Deco, Xavi and Thierry Henry failed to score over 180 minutes against United, who played more as a team. ""It's gone out of our hands,"" a Barcelona board member, who declined to be named, told Reuters at Old Trafford on Tuesday. ""We're good, professional corporate managers but we haven't managed the people, the intangibles,"" another member of the board, most of whom were educated at Barcelona's elite business school Esade, said. ""The stars need to manage themselves,"" Txiki Begiristain, Barca's sporting director, told Reuters. ""Circumstances have led to this, we've had injuries. But maybe because we've lived through glory, now it's harder. We have to encourage our stars."" 'PERMISSIVE ATTITUDE' This protective, forgiving attitude is what Barca fans want to see eradicated, with crowd chants this season including ""Menys millons, mes collons"" (fewer millions, more balls). ""I've been surprised by the permissive attitude,"" said Albert Ferrer, a former Barcelona and Chelsea defender, now a television commentator. ""The top players have to give, strikers must score in a team like Barca. There's been too much complacency with the key players who haven't been up to their (usual) standard."" Barca's plight compares with the struggle faced by archrivals Real Madrid, when their own glittering side failed to deliver. Real Madrid last won the Champions League in 2002 with Zinedine Zidane and Luis Figo but the addition of Ronaldo and David Beckham failed to bring more titles and the players were blamed by Spanish media for a lack of team cohesion. Since Joan Laporta won the club presidency five years ago, Barcelona have emulated some of United's commercial tactics with improved marketing, lucrative pre-season tours and other money-spinning schemes. United hold the edge, however, in the figure of manager Alex Ferguson, who has been in charge of the team for more than 20 years and will not hesitate to off-load players if he thinks their egos have risen above the club. Keeping a manager and maintaining strong club discipline is the best way to guarantee consistency and success, said Josep Maria Minguella, a former agent who helped bring high-profile players like Diego Maradona and Rivaldo to Barcelona. ""I don't know of many United players who haven't delivered,"" he told Reuters. He added that after their 2006 success, Barcelona ""thought they'd found the magic trick, but a year went by without winning anything and nobody did anything, as any company would do with highly-paid employees who're not delivering. ""This is the lesson."

The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission Monday gave permission to mobile and private landline companies to operate their networks in the three hill districts. BTRC held a meeting with the PSTN and mobile operators at the BTRC conference room on introducing mobile and PSTN networks in the three hill districts. At the meeting chaired by BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam, operators were told to introduce mobile and PSTN networks to the municipal areas of the three hill districts such as Bandarban, Khagrachhari and Rangamati. Alam told bdnews24.com: ""The decision has fulfilled the long-standing demand of the people of the hill areas who did not enjoy modern telecom facilities. The operators have been told to start work quickly."" In a statement, BTRC said the meeting stressed SIM registration in the hill districts and the operators have been asked to conduct subscriber service activities themselves. After the BTRC decision, Grameenphone director (public relations) Syed Yamin Bakht told bdnews24.com: ""As per government policy, the area will be quickly brought under the Grameenphone network. We want to use the same network infrastructure with other mobile operators.""

en.15.65.114.2008.5.4,Cabinet approves Plc plan for BTTB,"Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet Sunday approved an ordinance to turn Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board into a public limited company, a government official said. Updated The cabinet approved the BTTB Amendment Ordinance 2008 at a meeting chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, CA's press secretary Fahim Munaim told reporters. Munaim said the BTTB would be transformed into a public limited company under the ordinance which would bring changes to the BTTB Ordinance 1979. With the law coming into effect, BTTB property will be owned by the public limited company. BTTB employees will be shifted to the Plc. Employees will have an option to retire if they do not want to work anymore, the CA's press secretary said. The landing station and submarine cable will also be handed over to the Plc, Munaim said. The cabinet on March 2 approved the ordinance in principle. On October 6 last year, the cabinet asked the post and telecommunications ministry to remove inconsistencies in the proposal by November. The ministry on Oct 7 formed a five-member committee to correct the proposal. Former BTTB general manager Ziaur Rashid Safdar was the convener of the committee. About 12,000 people work for the BTTB against 19,409 posts. A German firm has been assigned to assess the property of the state-owned entity. Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Department had been created under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to run the telecommunication services on a commercial basis after the Liberation War in 1971. The T&T Department was converted into a corporate body in 1976. The department was restructured into Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board and mandated by an ordinance in 1979 to provide basic telecommunication services. The BTTB Ordinance of 1979 had given BTTB the monopoly rights and powers for issuing licence for telecommunications and wireless services. In 1995, the government amended the BTTB Ordinance 1979 and transferred the regulatory authority from BTTB to the telecoms ministry. According to the telecommunications policy formulated in 1998, the BTTB was meant to be restructured in two phases. bdnews"

She was taken from the special jail to the Special Judges' Court, set up on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises around 9:45 am. Tuesday's court is supposed to finish hearing of a plea to withdraw all charges against Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former power secretary, another accused in the case. The court on April 30 finished hearing on the same plea for Hasina. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon police on Sept 2, 2007, naming eight people, including Hasina. The graft watchdog accused the former prime minister and the others of being involved in the exchange of Tk 3 crore in bribes from Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium's local representative, and Summit Group and United Group representatives, for awarding the contracts to set up three power plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. Other accused in the case are former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of the Power Development Board Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman.

en.15.65.44.2008.5.2,Britain's Brown mauled in local elections,"LONDON,May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's ruling Labour Party slumped to its worst local election defeat in 40 years on Friday, dealing a bitter blow to Prime Minister Gordon Brown in his first test at the polls since taking over from Tony Blair. Buffeted by global economic turmoil, bedeviled by party in-fighting, he now faces an uphill climb against the resurgent Conservatives in the next parliamentary elections due in 2010. ""If the economic crisis continues through 2010, Brown's dead in the water,"" MORI pollster Robert Worcester told Reuters. With two-thirds of the results counted from local councils in England and Wales, BBC predictions put the Conservatives on 44 percent and Labour on an ignominious 24 per cent, one point behind the centrist Liberal Democrats. The results were a damning verdict on Brown's first year in power since taking over from Tony Blair, and the poor showing could raise questions about his leadership, analysts said. But government ministers said the poll reflected a downturn in the economy caused by the worldwide credit crunch and Brown would bounce back to win the next national election. Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman said: ""These are disappointing results and we recognize the difficult economic context, with people feeling the pinch."" Citing a new party mantra for rebranding a badly bruised Brown, she told BBC News: ""We are determined to listen."" The Conservatives, the once dominant party of Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill, were in buoyant mood after suffering a decade in the political wilderness. ""The ship of state is heading towards the rocks,"" said Conservative local government spokesman Eric Pickles. Nick Clegg, new leader of the Liberal Democrats who could hold the balance of power if the next election produces a hung parliament, said: ""It is only the second time in our history in the post-war period that we have overtaken Labour as a share of the vote."" Some 4,000 seats on 160 councils across England and Wales were up for grabs in Thursday's elections. John Curtice, politics professor at Strathclyde University, said the Conservatives fared better than expected while Labour had done even worse than the most dismal predictions. ""WORST DRUBBING FOR 40 YEARS"" Newspapers said Brown had been punished by voters angry over his decision to abolish the lowest income tax band. The reform triggered a Labour Party revolt that forced him to make concessions in order to avoid hurting the poor. ""Brown takes a local election hammering,"" the Daily Telegraph said. The Guardian called it ""a mauling."" The Times said Labour suffered its ""worst drubbing in 40 years."" The former finance minister had enjoyed a brief honeymoon with voters after he took over from Blair last June. But the media and opposition accused him of dithering over calling a snap election in October -- a move he eventually decided against -- and he has also been beset by party mutinies, economic turmoil and industrial unrest. Attention now turns to London where two political mavericks are battling for the job of mayor in the closest election since the office was created eight years ago. Victory for Conservative candidate Boris Johnson in the race would be a major boost for the party's leader David Cameron. A win for incumbent Ken Livingstone would provide some relief for Brown. Turnout was expected to have been high, which pollsters said could favor Livingstone. The result is due later on Friday. ""Ken Livingstone stands between Gordon Brown and ... a disaster,"" Curtice said."

Commodities extended Friday's gains, with gold and grains WN8 up in early trade, while Treasuries were flat. Stock markets in Australia and Singapore both gained 0.6 percent, while Hong Kong .HSI was steady, but volumes were thin as Japan and Korea were closed for national holidays.

Global stocks as measured by MSCI .MIWD00000PUS gained 5.3 percent in April, its largest monthly gain since December 2003. US stocks ended higher on Friday after data showed The world's largest economy shedding jobs at a slower pace than expected, easing concerns about the risk of a deep recession.

The US dollar was a shade softer but held on to of most of last week's gains, supported by expectations the Federal Reserve will not need to cut interest rates again any time soon. ""The drop in the unemployment rate has strengthened the market's conviction that the Fed is done,"" said Darren Gibbs, an economist at Deutsche Bank. The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark federal funds rate on April 30 by one-quarter point to 2 percent in what may be the last in a series of cuts aimed at aiding an economy hit by a housing slump and credit market turmoil. Europe will be a major focus of investors' attention this week as the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England meet separately to discuss interest rates against a backdrop of declining economic strength.

The issue of food security has hijacked the weekend meeting of trade ministers of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on the Indonesian resort island. ""The ministers affirmed that access to adequate and reliable supply of rice and stable prices are fundamental to the region's economic and social well being,"" said an ASEAN statement. To meet these ends, it said ministers recognized the need to improve productivity through technology transfers, research and development as well as making more land available for agriculture and lifting spending -- both public and private. Indonesian Trade Minister Mari Pangestu told a news conference that while ASEAN had stopped short of ""concrete actions"", the group ""did agree very strongly to communicate and cooperate among ourselves."" Asian rice prices have almost trebled this year. The Asian Development Bank meeting in Madrid pledged financial aid, without giving details of how much might be on offer for loans, and called for action from global governments. The African Development Bank offered $1 billion more in food aid and urged grain-exporting countries not to curb shipments. Countries including India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Brazil have restricted food exports in a bid to secure domestic supplies and limit inflation. Guinea on Saturday announced it was setting up an emergency food stock, especially for rice. Former U.N. chief Kofi Annan said on Friday that farmers in Africa could double food output in five to 10 years if rich countries partner them in a ""Green Revolution"" for a long-term solution to the continent's food crisis, Annan, who led a meeting of agriculture experts in Salzburg, said in a teleconference call that major funding was required to offset the impact on the world's poorest continent of the sharp price hikes for essential food and fuel. Humanitarian aid could only be the first step of a longer-term strategy which should seek ""to enable African farmers to dramatically increase their output so that Africa can feed itself and not be dependent on food aid"". ""MASSIVE VIOLATION"" OF HUMAN RIGHTS The World Food Program has described soaring food prices as a ""silent tsunami"" that threatens to plunge more than 100 million people into poverty. The new U.N. food envoy on Friday sought a special meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council this month to address a global food crisis he said was a ""massive violation"" of human rights. Olivier De Schutter said he wanted the Geneva-based Human Rights Council to hold a special session around May 22 or 23 to complement efforts by other international agencies to tackle the crisis and to establish it as a human rights issue. ""If we had 100 million persons arrested in a dictatorial regime, if we had 100 million persons beaten up by police, of course we'd be marching in the streets and we'd be convening special sessions,"" De Schutter said at a news conference. Protests, strikes and riots have erupted in developing countries around the world after dramatic rises in the prices of wheat, rice, corn, oils and other essential foods that have made it difficult for the poor to make ends meet. U.S. President George W. Bush proposed this week $770 million in new U.S. food aid to stave off the crisis, pledging Washington would take the lead in combating global hunger. Bush said on Friday food prices have been rising as a result of soaring energy prices but the use of corn-based ethanol is not the main driver behind rising prices at the supermarket. WTO TALKS Southeast Asian trade ministers repeated in their statement a commitment to conclude the long-delayed Doha round of global trade negotiations by the end of the year. The food crisis should be a ""big jolt"" to concluding the global trade negotiations, said Australian Trade Minister Simon Crean, who was also attending the Bali meeting. He said good progress had been made in the past few weeks but a possible May 19 date for a potentially key Geneva meeting of World Trade Organization ministers was looking unlikely. ""We're hopeful that a date very soon after that is."" The Doha negotiations were launched in 2001 to lower barriers to trade to give the world economy a lift and help the poorest countries to fight poverty by exporting more. But negotiators say the talks risk more years of delay or outright collapse if there is not a breakthrough soon."

Thousands of people obstructed the fire fighters who had come to the scene to douse the fire and threw brickbats at the police.

The US dollar was broadly weaker as doubts resurfaced on about the health of the US economy, while high oil prices boosted currencies of commodity exporters such as the Australian and Canadian dollars. The relentless surge in commodities from oil to rice is a key concern for central banks, although some investors have started to price in the view that the worst of the credit crisis and the US economic slowdown could be over. By 10:30 pm EDT, MSCI's measure of Asian stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was 0.1 percent weaker, backing off a four-month high hit on Monday. The benchmark has risen 2 percent in the last two sessions but is down 6 percent so far this year. US light crude for June delivery CLc1, a global benchmark, rose 22 cents to $120.19 a barrel. It jumped more than $4 on Monday to a record high of $120.36. ""A lot of this is supply-driven, with the market very vulnerable to any disruption in supplies,"" said Mark Pervan, a senior commodities analyst at Australian & New Zealand Bank. ""We're seeing large oil-producing countries coming up as a question mark,"" he said. The rise in oil to a fresh record high raised market concerns about the outlook for US consumer spending. Prices of oil and other dollar-denominated commodities usually rise to adjust for inflation when the US currency falls. Stock markets in Australia , Taiwan and Singapore fell between 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent. Hong Kong .HSI eased while South Korea was flat as trading resumed after a holiday. Japanese markets remain closed for a national holiday.

Record oil prices also hit stocks. GOLD ADVANCES Gold extended gains, adding to a rise of nearly 2 percent in New York, helped by bargain hunting and higher oil prices, which enhanced the metal's appeal as a hedge against inflation. Gold was changing hands around $873.70/874.70 an ounce, up from $871.15/872.55 in late New York trading on Monday. It hit a four-month low of $845 on Friday. Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar eased to 73.015 .DXY, having backed off a 73.698 high on Friday. The euro bought $1.5500, although dealers said the market appeared to be in the mood to test resistance around $1.5570. The dollar was trading around 104.90 yen after it failed to sustain a high of 105.92 on Monday. The rise in commodity prices comes at a time when Wall Street does not expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its next meeting in June. The Fed lowered its benchmark federal funds rate on April 30 by one-quarter point to 2 percent in what may be the last in a series of cuts aimed at aiding an economy hit hard by a housing slump and credit market turmoil. The US economy lost jobs for the fourth month in a row in April but at a slower pace than earlier in the year, easing fears the economy was slipping into a deep recession, although the rise in oil prices has raised some fresh doubts. Europe will be a major focus of investors' attention this week as the European Central Bank and Bank of England hold policy reviews against a backdrop of weakening economic strength.

en.15.65.184.2008.5.6,Chrysler tries fuel-price guarantee to boost sales,"DETROIT, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chrysler LLC will let US consumers lock in gasoline prices for three years under a new incentive program launching at a time of sliding vehicle sales, rising oil prices and deepening consumer uncertainty. The US automaker, which has seen sales drop by almost 18 percent this year, said it would offer anyone buying one of its vehicles a pre-paid card that could be used to cap fuel prices at $2.99 per gallon for three years. The sales incentive, which will be rolled out on Tuesday, will only cover the first 12,000 miles driven based on the estimated mileage for the Chrysler car or truck purchased, executives with the privately held automaker said. The novel Chrysler incentive offer is introduced at a time when high gas prices have hammered sales of the SUVs and trucks that dominate Chrysler's line-up. ""This could be a game-changer in terms of how vehicles are sold in the marketplace,"" Chrysler's head of North American sales, Steve Landry, told reporters. Chrysler, now owned by Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL, said it would hedge its financial exposure to rising gas prices as a result of the incentive offer. Other automakers have experimented with pre-paid gas cards as an alternative to traditional showroom incentives, such as cash rebates and zero-percent financing. But Chrysler said its program marked the first effort to set a ceiling on fuel prices for consumers across the United States and was prompted by its own research showing that uncertainty about gas prices had become a major drag on sales. ""One of the things that weighs heavily on people's minds is the volatility of fuel prices,"" said Jim Press, Chrysler's vice chairman and sales chief. Chrysler said its ""Let's Refuel America"" program would be offered for May and would exclude gas-thirsty performance cars like its Dodge Viper and new Challenger muscle car. Because of the way the program is structured, it amounts to a heavier subsidy on bigger, less-fuel-efficient vehicles. For example, the program would cover some 2,100 gallons of fuel for an entry-level Dodge Ram pickup but only about 1,300 gallons for the Dodge Caliber, currently the smallest car in Chrysler's line-up, based on published mileage estimates. Chrysler said a more detailed estimate based on gallons of fuel covered by the guarantee would be available this week. Based on the current national average of $3.61 per gallon for regular unleaded as tracked by AAA, the incentive would be worth about $1,300 for the pickup truck and about $800 on the smaller hatchback. Chrysler said consumers would have the option of choosing between the fuel-price cap and more traditional incentives. For example, a Caliber buyer would have to pick between a $750 cash-back offer and the fuel guarantee. In the heavily discounted truck segment, buyers will have the option of taking a $5,500 rebate on the Dodge Ram or a reduced $3,000 rebate plus the fuel-price guarantee. Chrysler, which lost $1.6 billion in 2007, has been criticized for its truck-heavy line-up and the low mileage of a line-up that also includes the Jeep and Chrysler brands. Press, a former Toyota Motor Corp executive, has said Chrysler will look to cut its SUV line-up and the company has announced a tie-up to get Japan's Nissan Motor Co to build it subcompact car starting in 2010. With just under 12 percent of the US market, Chrysler now ranks as the No 4 player by sales volume, although Honda Motor Co has closed the gap on the strength of its small car line-up and reputation for fuel economy. Industry-wide US auto sales dropped 14 percent in April to their lowest annual rate in a decade. Analysts and automakers now expect sales to fall below 15.5 million units this year, marking the industry's weakest year in a decade. Chrysler's larger Detroit-based rivals General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co have responded to the downturn by cutting production without resorting to the kind of cut-rate incentives the industry used to bounce back from the brief recession in 2001"

In the fall, Tina Turner will take it to her loyal subjects. The Rock Hall of Famer plans to embark on her first tour in eight years beginning October1 at the Sprint Center in Kansas City, Mo. The arena tour will be promoted by AEG Live and will include about three dozen shows in North America, likely to be followed by engagements in Europe and other international dates. Turner announced the tour at a taping of ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" set to air Thursday. She said tickets will go on sale May 12. Turner's 2000 tour, billed as her last, was the top-grossing jaunt of that year, according to Billboard Boxscore. It grossed almost $110 million from 89 shows and drew more than 2 million people, averaging more than 24,000 a night in attendance. At the time it was the top-grossing tour ever by a female artist. The record has since been topped by Cher and Madonna."
en.15.65.96.2008.5.1,Iran complains to UN.about Clinton comment,"United Nations, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran complained to the United Nations on Wednesday about US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's comment the United States could ""totally obliterate"" Iran in retaliation for a nuclear strike against Israel. Iran's deputy ambassador to the United Nations sent a letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the president of the Security Council expressing Iran's condemnation of ""such a provocative, unwarranted and irresponsible statement."" Clinton made the remarks last week while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination. The New York senator said she wanted to make clear to Tehran what she was prepared to do if she becomes president in the hope that this warning would deter any Iranian nuclear attack against the Jewish state. ""I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran (if it attacks Israel),"" Clinton said in an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ""In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them,"" she said. ""That's a terrible thing to say but those people who run Iran need to understand that because that perhaps will deter them from doing something that would be reckless, foolish and tragic,"" Clinton said. Iran, which Washington and its allies charge is seeking nuclear arms, has voiced war-like rhetoric in recent years amid speculation its nuclear facilities could face U.S. or Israeli military action. Tehran denies it is trying to acquire nuclear weapons and says it needs nuclear technology to generate electricity. Israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons but, as part of a policy of ""strategic ambiguity,"" has not confirmed or denied the nature of its arsenal. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad outraged the international community in 2005 by saying ""Israel should be wiped off the map."" In the letter dated April 30, Deputy Ambassador Mehdi Danesh-Yazdi said he wanted to reiterate Iran's rejection of all weapons of mass destruction including nuclear weapons. ""Moreover, I wish to reiterate my government's position that the Islamic Republic of Iran has no intention to attack any other nations,"" he said. ""Nonetheless .... Iran would not hesitate to act in self-defense to respond to any attack against the Iranian nation and to take appropriate defensive measures to protect itself."

en.15.65.363.2008.5.4,Food crisis still playing out on world trade: US,"NUSA DUA, May 4 Indonesia (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Soaring food prices could encourage nations to remove barriers on food imports, but there is also a risk panic over food could hurt global trade, US Trade Representative Susan Schwab told Reuters on Sunday. Progress has been made in talks over a long-delayed global trade deal, although a renewed push was needed in some areas to meet a goal of passing the Doha round this year, she said. Schwab, who was attending a Southeast Asian trade meeting on the Indonesian resort of Bali, said it was only just becoming clear what impact the food crisis was having on world trade. ""It seems to be sort of a push me, pull you kind of impact,"" she said, noting that Doha could get impetus from countries bringing down barriers on food imports, but adding that new trade distortions could also emerge from worries over access to food. ""Which really would hurt the Doha round, because it flies in the face of what you should really be doing, which is really eliminating as many distortions as you can so you have a free flow of food,"" she said. Countries including India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Brazil have imposed curbs on food exports in a bid to secure domestic supplies and limit inflation, spooking big food importers. In Asia, in particular, concern over rice prices is growing after several countries imposed export restrictions. Schwab said soaring rice prices was a big topic at the Bali meeting. ""And it doesn't take long for the conversation about rice and the situation about food prices to gravitate into a discussion about Doha,"" she said in an interview. ""There is a sense that we've got a window within the next, you know, month or so, where we have a chance of that breakthrough once again and that it's worth the investment of time and energy to get there,"" she said. CRUCIAL TRADE MEETING She said May 19 was one of the dates that had surfaced for holding a potentially key Geneva meeting of World Trade Organisation ministers. ""I don't know if it's the 19th, if it's the 26th, but I can tell you the dates are sliding week by week, not month by month, which is perhaps the more significant indication."" The Doha talks have been frequently bogged down by discussions over technical issues, often related to agriculture. ""I think we are really close to having laid out all the key parameters for sensitive products,"" she said, referring to politically sensitive agricultural products that countries can opt to shield from the full impact of tariff cuts. In other areas, there was more work to be done, she said. ""But I think what we're talking about here, and this is most significant, we're within a few weeks of taking a run at a horizontal process and that would start with the senior official process and then you'd have ministers come together,"" she said. The ""horizontal process"" is where negotiators make trade-offs between agricultural and industrial items. Schwab played down concerns that any Doha agreement could struggle to get through Congress, which has failed to pass a free trade agreement with Colombia under the Bush administration. ""Traditionally, there's been more political push-back on bilateral free trade agreements than multilateral agreements."" The Doha talks were launched in 2001 to lower barriers to trade to give the world economy a lift and help the poorest countries to fight poverty by exporting more, but negotiators say without a breakthrough soon they could face more years of delay or outright collapse"
en.15.65.18.2008.5.5,Global Fund mulls loans to fight AIDS,"MOSCOW, May 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria may loan cash to developing countries when they grow too wealthy to qualify for grants, the fund's director, Michel Kazatchkine, said on Sunday. Including loans in its remit would allow The Global Fund - which has raised about $10.8 billion for donations since 2002 - to extend help to governments and civic groups in heavily infected but increasingly wealthy countries. ""To us it's important that when the world's money for aid is being distributed it not only takes into account economic factors but also, for example, burden of disease,"" Kazatchkine told Reuters in an interview at an HIV/AIDS conference in Moscow. The Global Fund, which was launched by Group of Eight industrialized nations and is financed largely by the US and European governments, estimates that around 6 million people die every year from either AIDS, tuberculosis or malaria. By the end of next year 10 countries from the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region - including Turkey, Kazakhstan and Russia - will no longer qualify for Global Fund grants as they will be considered upper income countries. But some of these countries have only just built up the mechanisms to battle AIDS, tuberculosis or malaria and Kazatchkine cited Kazakhstan as an example of a country which may benefit from a loan and extended help from The Global Fund. Former Soviet Kazakhstan in Central Asia has grown richer over the last decade from high energy and commodity prices but faces an accelerating number of people with the HIV virus. ""The challenge for Kazakhstan is how to manage in the future,"" Kazatchkine said. ""I wonder whether we couldn't consider, as an international community, whether Kazakhstan instead of not being eligible at all in the future could potentially be eligible but then commit to reimburse by 2015 or 2020 or whatever."" The Global fund has previously pledged over $67 million in grants to Kazakhstan to fight AIDS and tuberculosis. It was Russia which set the precedent for potentially extending The Global Fund's work into loans, Kazatchkine said. Huge wealth from energy and commodity exports have also enriched Russia and in 2006 it pledged to repay 80 percent of The Global Fund's $320 million grant. ""What I'm saying is that with the Russian example we may find ways of basically a free loan that would allow these countries to access resources now but also behave as a donor,"" Kazatchkine said. Africa receives almost 60 percent of The Global Fund's cash -- whose main donors are taxpayers in the United States, Japan and Europe -- followed by East Asia with about 13 percent of the total raised. The Global Fund has pledged nearly $1.2 billion to Eastern Europe and Central Asia through to 2010, about 55 percent into targeting HIV, and Kazatchkine said there has already been much progress -- especially in developing civic groups. But as countries become richer and move away from grants, civil society groups worry without The Global Fund cash they will be marginalized by big government. ""These are societies the relationship between public sector and the non-governmental sectors haven't been established and do not run as smoothly as western societies,"" Kazatchkine said. The annual rate of new infections in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region has fallen in the last few years to about 150,000 last year from 210,000 in 2001"
en.15.65.103.2008.5.7,Disease stalks survivors of huge Myanmar cyclone,"Yangon, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Disease, hunger and thirst pose a major threat to hundreds of thousands of survivors of Cyclone Nargis, aid agencies said on Wednesday, urging Myanmar's military rulers to open the doors to international humanitarian relief. With 22,500 dead and 41,000 missing, most of them from a massive storm surge that washed over the Irrawaddy delta, it is the most devastating cyclone to hit Asia since 1991, when 143,000 people died in neighboring Bangladesh. ""Time is of the essence,"" Ann Veneman, Executive Director of the United Nations children's fund UNICEF, said in a statement. ""In situations such as these, children are highly vulnerable to disease and hunger and they need immediate help to survive."" Aid officials say hundreds of thousands will have been left homeless in the vast swamplands of the delta, where mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue are endemic. There will also be the risk of cholera and chronic diarrhea from filthy water and corpses rotting in the tropical heat and humidity of Southeast Asia. Governments and aid agencies urged the secretive government to relax their tight grip to allow humanitarian assistance into Myanmar, which has been ruled by the military for 46 years. It has been under U.S. financial sanctions since 2003, but Washington on Tuesday lifted an aid requirement to try and make it easier to provide direct assistance. RICE HANDOUTS The U.N.'s World Food Programme began doling out rice in Yangon, the largest city and former capital, where people are having to queue for water and food prices are skyrocketing. ""The food security situation in the country, which was already severe, is likely to become more acute,"" the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in its most recent assessment of the disaster. The first batch of more than $10 million of foreign aid arrived from Thailand but a lack of specialized equipment slowed distribution. Two more aid flights are due to land from India early on Wednesday. UNICEF said it was distributing aid. Despite the disaster's size, France said the former Burma's ruling generals were still placing too many conditions on aid. ""The United Nations is asking the Burmese government to open its doors. The Burmese government replies: 'Give us money, we'll distribute it.' We can't accept that,"" Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner told parliament. Rashid Khalikov, a senior U.N. aid official, appealed to Myanmar to waive visa requirements for U.N. aid workers trying to get into the country of 53 million. ""Unfortunately we cannot tell you how many people are in need of assistance,"" he said. ""We just clearly understand that it will probably be in the hundreds of thousands."" Information Minister Kyaw Hsan said the military were ""doing their best"" but there could be fallout for the uniformed rulers who pride themselves on their ability to cope with any challenge. ""The myth they have projected about being well-prepared has been totally blown away,"" said analyst Aung Naing Oo, who fled to Thailand after a brutally crushed 1988 uprising. ""This could have a tremendous political impact in the long term."" The information minister said Myanmar had sufficient stocks of rice despite damage to grain stored in the delta, known as the ""rice bowl of Asia"" 50 years ago when Burma was the world's largest exporter. But even in villages that managed to withstand the worst of the winds, vital supplies were running out, residents said. Reflecting the scale of the crisis, the junta said it would postpone a constitutional referendum in the worst-hit areas. But state TV said the May 10 vote on the charter, part of the army's much-criticized ""roadmap to democracy,"" would proceed as planned in the rest of the Southeast Asian nation."
en.15.65.410.2008.5.3,Chavez best hope for Colombia`s Betancourt: husband,"Sao Paulo, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is the best hope for successfully negotiating the release of French-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt and other hostages held by leftist Colombian guerrillas, her husband said on Friday. France is spearheading a campaign to restart talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the Marxist rebel group holding hundreds of captives, including Betancourt, in secret camps deep in the jungle. Chavez, a self-proclaimed socialist revolutionary who has expressed sympathies for the FARC, helped negotiate the release of six hostages this year. But Colombian President Alvaro Uribe rejects a formal role in release talks for Chavez, who irked his Colombian counterpart by urging more recognition for the rebels. ""The Colombian government, I think out of pride, doesn't want Chavez to participate,"" Juan Carlos Lecompte, Betancourt's husband, told Reuters on the sidelines of an environmental conference in Sao Paulo. ""But for us, the relatives of the captives, he is the main hope that we have. We've begged him to keep working for their release and that is what he is doing."" Betancourt, a former Colombian presidential candidate who also holds French citizenship, was abducted by FARC rebels six years ago and has become the public face of Colombia's hostage crisis. Chavez and Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa, who has also clashed with Uribe, have said they were close to winning the release of Betancourt and 11 others. But those efforts were derailed, they said, when the Colombian military bombed a FARC camp in Ecuador on March 1, killing top rebel commander Raul Reyes and setting off a week-long regional crisis. ""If they hadn't killed Reyes, maybe Ingrid would be here with us today,"" Lecompte said. This week, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner visited Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela in a bid to restart talks with the FARC and ease tensions between the three Andean nations. French President Nicolas Sarkozy wrote a letter to Chavez on April 27 asking him to find a way to reopen talks. ""Use your influence, which is large, to find the way for a new initiative, from which we can make proposals to the international community,"" Sarkozy said in an extract of the letter released by Venezuela on Thursday. Colombia's decades-long conflict has let up under the conservative Uribe, a U.S. ally who has sent troops to retake areas under the control of armed rebels. The FARC is still fighting in remote areas, aided by funds from cocaine trafficking and extortion. Though Uribe's hardline stance with the FARC has made him popular with most Colombians, former hostages and relatives of those still held oppose any rescue attempt by the military. ""I know that in a rescue attempt, no one gets out alive,"" Luis Eladio Perez, one of the six hostages who was released this year, said at the same event in Sao Paulo."
en.15.65.257.2008.5.4,Zimbabwe opposition still undecided on run-off,"HARARE, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's main opposition party said on Saturday it was still undecided on whether its leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, should take part in a run-off election against President Robert Mugabe. Election officials announced on Friday that Tsvangirai, who heads the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), had beaten Mugabe in the March 29 presidential poll but failed to win the absolute majority necessary to avoid a second ballot. The MDC has accused election officials of rigging the results, which showed Tsvangirai won 47.9 percent of the vote to Mugabe's 43.2 percent. The party says Tsvangirai won the election outright and Mugabe's rule is over. But it has not signaled how it will handle the run-off. ""If you want a 'yes' or 'no' answer, it's not going to come (for now) because there are issues that have to be clarified,"" MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said at a news conference after the party's national executive met to discuss the run-off. The government said it expected the MDC to take part. ""We know they are going to participate in the run-off but want to buy time because they are not ready,"" Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga said. The MDC reaffirmed its position that Tsvangirai had won the election outright and that there was no need for a run-off. It said its representatives had not been allowed to verify results. Zimbabweans are struggling with a deep economic crisis, marked by chronic food and fuel shortages, inflation of more than 165,000 percent and rising poverty and malnutrition. Thokozani Khupe, MDC vice-president, told reporters the party was lobbying the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to urge the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) and the ruling ZANU-PF party to allow the MDC to check the results. ""We are talking to SADC leaders so that they put pressure on ZEC and ZANU-PF to proceed professionally,"" Khupe said. FOREIGN INTERFERENCE The government dismissed the MDC's approach to SADC as a stalling tactic. ""Lobbying SADC over a verification process they (the MDC) took part in is wasting time,"" said Matonga. Mugabe, in power for 28 years, has accepted the official results and will contest the second ballot. He would stay in power under electoral laws if Tsvangirai boycotts the run-off, which by law should be held within 21 days of the first ballot's results. ZEC has the power to extend the period in between the two ballots, and political observers say a 40-day wait was likely. ZEC chairman George Chiweshe said the commission would meet soon to set a run-off date. ""The commission is going to meet as soon as possible. I cannot state exactly when the run-off will be held, but I can confirm that the poll will be on a date to be announced by the commission,"" he said in comments carried in the online addition of the state-owned Sunday Mail. The opposition, Western governments and human rights groups have accused Mugabe of unleashing militias to scare Zimbabweans into backing him in the run-off. The government denies the allegation and says the MDC has carried out political violence. Twenty MDC supporters have been killed and more than 1,000 homes have been burnt or destroyed by ZANU-PF militia since the elections, Khupe said. Mugabe's critics say they doubt the next ballot will be fair. It is unclear how Western powers will react to the run-off. On Friday, the United States and former colonial power Britain questioned the credibility of the official results. Mugabe, regarded by many in Africa as a liberation era hero, accuses Britain of plotting with the opposition to oust him. Few African leaders, including South African President Thabo Mbeki, have criticized the Zimbabwean leader publicly."

They made the demand at a May Day discussion, organised by the United Federation of Garments Workers at the Awami League's central office on Bangabandhu Avenue. Tofail warned of a humanitarian disaster in the making. ""A prelude to humanitarian disaster is looming because of the food crisis. Stalemate prevails in every sector in the country due to the long-running state of emergency,"" Tofail said. The AL leader said Hasina's release could help overcome the situation.

He demanded fixing minimum wages for workers at Tk 4,500 each and introduction of a permanent rationing system for them. Suranjit Sengputa said: ""We want the Election Commission to abandon a plan to redraw constituencies and pay attention to parliamentary polls instead.""

en.15.65.364.2008.5.5,Democrats fear divided party after nominee chosen,"Shelbyville, Indiana, MAy 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US presidential primaries often divide party loyalists, but the drawn-out battle between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama may leave some Democrats too bitter to band together against the Republicans in November. Indiana homemaker Ginger Smith, 48, said she was with Clinton all the way and would not vote for Obama. ""I believe a woman needs to be in the presidency,"" Smith said. ""He's too smooth and doesn't have enough experience. ... I don't trust him, that's my gut feeling."" And if the Illinois senator is the Democratic nominee? ""I'll vote for McCain,"" Smith said, referring to Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. But on reflection, she tempered her response to say, ""I probably won't vote."" While party leaders insist Democrats will mend fences once a nominee is chosen -- which could happen as late as the party's convention in August -- the increasing bitterness and very nature of the battle between Obama and Clinton, a New York senator, may make healing harder than usual. Thirty percent of Clinton supporters said they would not vote for Obama in November if he were the nominee, according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released last week. Twenty-two percent of Obama voters said they would not vote for Clinton. Obama leads Clinton in both the popular vote and number of delegates who select the party's nominee at the convention in Denver. Each has won some of the state-by-state contests, and they face off again on Tuesday in Indiana and North Carolina. The eventual winner will face McCain in the November presidential election. Voters in both Democratic camps have said the long, negative contest has poisoned them against the rival candidate. ""I'm increasingly frustrated by Hillary Clinton and the way she has treated Obama,"" said Judy Trane, a 41-year-old Kansas mother of three. Trane said her initial excitement over Democratic prospects for November had faded to disappointment and near despair as a result of the bitter campaign. ""It is so sad. I so want the party to do well,"" Trane said. ""I've had several people say to me, 'I couldn't possibly vote for the other Democratic candidate.'"" BICKERING The bitterness of the campaign is not the only thing that could hamper healing. The fact both candidates represent a dream -- Clinton would be the first female U.S. president, Obama the first black -- adds a burden. Democrats fear that black voters, traditional supporters, may desert the party if Clinton is nominated instead of Obama. Obama supporter Chantelle Curry, who is black, said she would probably vote for Clinton if push came to shove. But she knows a lot of people who will not. ""I've heard my friends and family say that,"" said Curry, a 40-year-old nurse living in Indiana. North Carolina State University political science professor Steven Greene said the race issue could go the other way, with some voters unwilling to support a black candidate. Clinton, too, has no chance of winning over some Democrats. ""For a lot of people who won't vote for Obama, race is an issue ... much like those who hate Hillary Clinton won't vote for her,"" Greene said. ""The degree to which you can blame that on a long, drawn-out campaign is pretty minimal."" Greene said parties had reunited despite bitter battles in previous primaries, and this time would be no exception. Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean and Clinton herself have also said they are confident the rifts will mend. ""I think we'll have a unified Democratic Party once we have a nominee,"" Clinton said on Saturday in North Carolina. ""I have no doubt about that because no matter how passionately either my supporters or Senator Obama's supporters feel about us, they have much more in common in terms of what we want in our country than they do with Senator McCain and the Republicans, because that would be more of the same."" Some Democrats do not see it that way. Obama supporter Julie McCormack, a coffee shop worker from Scottsdale, Arizona, said the shrill and endless Democratic contest prompted her to check out McCain on the Internet. ""The two of them bickering -- I just can't watch them on TV anymore, I just can't watch it. All of that really annoyed me and bothered me,"" she said. ""I am leaning toward McCain because he seems like a decent person."""
en.15.65.281.2008.5.2,Iraq PM sends team to Iran to discuss militias,"Baghdad, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has sent a delegation to tell Iran to stop backing Shi'ite militias, officials said on Thursday, underscoring Iraq's unease over the influence of its powerful neighbor. The delegation from Maliki's ruling United Iraqi Alliance (UIA) left for Tehran on Wednesday amid further accusations from U.S. military officials that large amounts of Iranian weapons have been found in Iraq. ""The UIA has decided to send a delegation to press the Iranian government to stop financing and supporting the armed groups,"" said Sami al-Askari, a senior legislator in the Shi'ite party and a close confidante of Maliki. In London, the U.S. military commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, said ""very, very significant"" amounts of Iranian weapons had been found since Maliki launched an offensive against militias in late March. Petraeus told the BBC after meeting Prime Minister Gordon Brown this included more than 1,000 mortar and artillery rounds, hundreds of rockets and dozens of armor-piercing bombs. The number found in Baghdad was even greater, said Petraeus. Washington accuses Shi'ite Iran of arming, training and funding rogue elements of the Mehdi Army militia of anti-U.S. Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Iran denies the charges. ""It's a very important step (to send the delegation),"" U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters in Texas. ""I think that the Iranians do care about what the shape of their future relationship with Iraq will be .... Do they want to work with the government of Iraq or are they going to subvert the government of Iraq?"" said Gates. Two suicide bombers killed 41 people and wounded 75 when they detonated explosive vests in a busy market in a town northeast of Baghdad, police said. The bombings occurred in an area where Sunni Islamist al Qaeda militants, blamed for most suicide bombings in Iraq, have sought to regroup. BAGHDAD FIGHTING Maliki's crackdown has triggered more than a month of clashes in Baghdad, during which militiamen have fired more than 700 rockets and mortars at targets in the capital. Many of those weapons were Iranian made, U.S. military officials have said. Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said the delegation had taken questions to Tehran that needed answering. Asked if the team, led by the deputy parliament speaker, would raise the issue of arming militias, Dabbagh said: ""They will discuss all issues that have been raised ... We expect and want the intervention of Iran to be through the elected government and not through a third party."" He did not elaborate nor say who the delegation would meet. U.S. officials say Sadr is living in the holy Iranian city of Qom, but Shi'ite officials denied reports the delegation would meet him. Sadr's spokesman denied the cleric was in Iran. U.S. military officials had planned to put on display some of the recently captured Iranian weapons but decided to let the Iraqis make their own case to Iran first. Maliki, a Shi'ite himself, is having to tread a fine line between Tehran and Washington -- two bitter foes that are also at loggerheads over Iran's nuclear program. But Maliki has also sought to show his independence. At a news conference on Wednesday, he said: ""I am not Iran's man in Iraq."" And he launched his offensive in the southern city of Basra without giving the U.S. military much notice. Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih this week described Baghdad's ties with Tehran as among the most complex it had. ""We cannot afford to have a precarious relationship that could degenerate and go back to a state of conflict that we have had in a previous era,"" Salih told Reuters. ""The time has come for this relationship to be put on a real sound footing, state to state."" Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war in the 1980s in which hundreds of thousands were killed. Ties have improved since Sunni Arab strongman Saddam Hussein was ousted in the U.S.-led invasion and a Shi'ite-led government came to power in Baghdad. U.S. forces said they killed 18 fighters in clashes beginning on Wednesday afternoon and running through the night in Sadr City, the Baghdad stronghold of Sadr. Police said two women and two children had been killed."

The Transparency International, Bangladesh boss said the ACC boss had spoken of his limitations in his recent speeches. ""A news analysis on his speeches since his takeover will prove that,"" he said. Muzaffer also said he had found lack of transparency and accountability in the ACC and its chairman in recent times. ""It may so happen that he could not work the way he did before because of some invisible forces,"" he said. He asked the commission to make everything clear about its drives to avoid rumours. Silence spawns rumours, he said. Bangladesh National UNESCO Club organised the discussion. Muzaffer stressed providing access for people to information on all government and nongovernmental organisations. The TIB boss praised the government move to make the Right to Information Act and said that it would ensure people's access to information on private and public organisations. Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan said that a democratic system without freedom of the media would be a farce. ""Besides, economic freedom is directly linked with free media,"" he added. He said that journalists of Bangladesh did good work despite many hurdles.

en.15.65.170.2008.5.7,Lebanon's political conflict turns violent,"BEIRUT, Wed May 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Supporters of Lebanon's US-backed government fought gun battles in Beirut on Wednesday with gunmen loyal to the Hezbollah-led opposition, escalating the country's worst internal crisis since the 1975-90 civil war. Supporters of pro-Iranian Hezbollah blocked main roads in the Lebanese capital with blazing tires, old cars and heaps of earth, paralyzing the city and cutting routes to its sea and airports. The clashes took place a day after the government accused Hezbollah of violating the country's sovereignty by operating its own telecommunications network and installing spy cameras at Beirut airport. Air traffic was suspended for six hours because of a strike by staff taking part in labor union action to demand more pay. The strike was backed by the Hezbollah-led opposition, whose 17-month-long struggle with Prime Minister Fouad Siniora's anti-Syrian cabinet has already led to bouts of lethal violence. Security sources said pro-government supporters exchanged assault rifle and grenade fire with Hezbollah sympathizers in the Beirut neighborhoods of Noueiri, Ras al Nabae and Wata al-Musaitbeh. It was not clear if there were casualties. Opposition gunmen took over two offices of the Future political group led by Saad al-Hariri, leader of the governing coalition and Lebanon's most influential Sunni politician. Youths loyal to the rival sides pelted each other with stones in Mazraa -- one of the Beirut districts where sectarian tensions have been high between Sunnis and Shi'ites. The army, mostly seen as neutral during the crisis, deployed in force but did not attempt to remove road barricades. Government minister Marwan Hamadeh said Hezbollah, a political group with a powerful guerrilla army and Syrian and Iranian backing, was ""trying to use military means to block the airport"". ""Lebanon has said it will not become an Iranian satellite,"" he told Reuters. A security source said the army had detained two men armed with M-16 assault rifles in Beirut. Tension between the government and Hezbollah escalated sharply on Tuesday when the cabinet said the group's communication network was ""an attack on the sovereignty of the state"". Hezbollah said it was part of its security apparatus and played a major role in its war with Israel in 2006. The group was also infuriated by the cabinet's decision to remove the head of airport security from his post. ""ARMED AND ANGRY"" Provoked by the government's moves, Hezbollah was ""flexing its muscles"" in the streets, said Oussama Safa, director of the Lebanese Center for Policy Studies. ""The heat has been turned up,"" he said, adding that there was scope for violence. ""But it's probably not going to unfold into war. A confrontation is not winnable,"" he said. ""Things could get very ugly, but I don't think they will spread out of hand,"" added Paul Salem, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. ""Everyone is armed and angry."" Hezbollah was the only Lebanese faction allowed to keep its weapons after the civil war to fight Israeli forces occupying the south. Israel withdrew in 2000 and the fate of Hezbollah's weapons is at the heart of the political crisis. A UN Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel bans the group from rearming and rebuilding its military infrastructure in south Lebanon. Governing coalition leaders allege Hezbollah is spying on the airport to monitor their movements. Eight members of the anti-Syrian coalition have been assassinated since 2005. Hezbollah has deemed Siniora's cabinet illegitimate since its Shia ministers resigned in 2006. The governing coalition has refused to yield to the opposition's demand for effective veto power in cabinet. The crisis has paralysed much of government and left Lebanon without a president for five months"
en.15.65.442.2008.5.5,<blink><font color=red>OPINION</font></blink><br>Protecting IPR: challenges and opportunities,"James F Moriarty Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com) -- Why should Bangladesh care about protecting intellectual property rights? Intellectual property rights (IPR) are the legal mechanismscopyrights, patents and trademarksthat ensure that the products we buy are genuine. Dangerous and defective counterfeit products, from counterfeit medication, to toothpaste, to auto parts, put the lives of consumers at risk. A strong IPR system ensures that inventors and innovators are rewarded for their ideas. IPR protections foster an environment in which creative and innovative industries can thrive and contribute to economic development worldwide. At the dawn of the 21st century, an increasing share of global economic output is generated by services, many of which depend on new and evolving technologies. Inventors, creators, and other risk-takers play a critical role in this economic progress, and the protection of IPR is necessary to ensure that the advances that result from their efforts are rewarded and valued. Progress in nanotechnology, information technology, and clean energy fosters economic development and improves standards of living worldwide. Intellectual property rights don't just protect inventors or large corporations; they protect local entrepreneurs and artists. A clear example of innovation in Bangladesh is the pioneering work of Mustafa Jabbar, inventor of the Bijoy Bangla keyboard and related software. The recent court decision recognising Mr Jabbar's ownership of the technology he developed is an important step in encouraging innovation. Bangladesh's film-makers such as Catherine and Tareque Masud have won critical international acclaim for their films but frequently suffer the theft of their work in their home country. The illegal sale of stolen music and films in nearly all of Bangladesh's markets is a troubling indicator of the scale of the IPR protection challenge. Developing countries too often assume that IPR only benefits first world nations. This perspective unfairly discounts indigenous capacity for innovationas if good ideas worth protecting and promoting can only come from the first world. Officials in less developed countries cite the World Trade Organisation's TRIPS agreement as granting their countries exemption from international IPR standards until 2013 (and 2016 for pharmaceutical patents). Relying upon these temporary ""exemptions"" is a choice fraught with risks. An economy built on weak IPR foundations is one in which the abuse of foreign and domestic IPR occurs hand-in-hand. Any country seeking free-trade agreements cannot ignore today's work to ensure meeting future obligations to protect IPR. The human potential to create and innovate is a boundless worldwide resource. Clear rules and strong enforcement of IPR allows countries to sustain economic development and to build recognisable and respected brands worldwide. Bangladesh's innovators, inventors and artists have proven themselves worthy of the highest awards and recognition world wideit's time that Bangladesh's domestic IPR mechanisms now grant them the same honour. James F Moriarty is US ambassador to Bangladesh."
en.15.65.22.2008.5.3,Sharapova lambasts WTA over publicity shoot,"OAKLAND, May 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Maria Sharapova hit out at the ruling body of women's tennis (WTA) on Friday for making her take part in a publicity shoot on the eve of the Italian Open. Sharapova could be fined $700,000 if she declines to do the shoot, which is part of the WTA's multi-million dollar global marketing campaign. The tournament begins on May 12. Since she does not wear a WTA patch on her clothing, the fine for skipping a tour promotional event would rise $400,000 from the standard $300,000. ""To ask me, or any of the other players, to do a long shoot like this is not right. Do you think the NBA would ask their top players to do a five-hour shoot the day before a playoff game?"" Sharapova told Reuters from her home in Los Angeles. The 2008 Australian Open champion said she understood the importance of supporting the tour and that she wanted to do the shoot. The issue was the timing. ""For them to threaten me with a $700,000 fine is just not right. The tour does not care what any of the players think, not just top players,"" the world number three added. ""The tour will say: 'We have done all these amazing things that the players wanted'. But trust me, these things they wanted as well and financially benefited from, including this shoot. ""I want people to understand that I took this action because this is one in a long list of things that the tour has ignored the players. This is not about just one shoot, I could not just sit back anymore."" FLEXIBILITY The WTA said Sharapova had the option of doing a two-and-a-half hour shoot, allowing for transport time. ""We will be as flexible as possible to accommodate all the player schedules, but we are not making exceptions,"" said WTA spokesman Andrew Walker. The WTA was working to raise the profile of the players, something their agents had been striving for, he added. ""This is an opportunity to do it as we are putting millions of dollars into this worldwide campaign. It's important for women's tennis and while we are sensitive to the demands of the tournament on our players, they've known about it for some time. ""It's in the rules"
en.15.65.409.2008.5.6,"Myanmar cyclone toll climbs to nearly 22,500","YANGON Tue May 6, ( bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's military government raised its death toll from Cyclone Nargis on Tuesday to nearly 22,500 with a further 41,000 missing, nearly all of them from a massive storm surge that swept into the Irrawaddy delta. Of the dead, only 671 were in the former capital, Yangon, and its outlying districts, state radio said, confirming Nargis as the most devastating cyclone to hit Asia since 1991, when 143,000 people died in Bangladesh. ""More deaths were caused by the tidal wave than the storm itself,"" Minister for Relief and Resettlement Maung Maung Swe told a news conference in the rubble-strewn city of five million, where food and water supplies are running low. ""The wave was up to 12 feet high and it swept away and inundated half the houses in low-lying villages,"" he said, giving the first detailed description of the weekend cyclone. ""They did not have anywhere to flee."" Information Minister Kyaw Hsan said the military were ""doing their best"", but analysts said there could be political fallout for the former Burma's rulers who pride themselves on their ability to cope with any challenge. ""The myth they have projected about being well-prepared has been totally blown away,"" said political analyst Aung Naing Oo, who fled to Thailand after a brutally crushed 1988 uprising. ""This could have a tremendous political impact in the long term."" Earlier, Foreign Minister Nyan Win said on state television that 10,000 people had died just in Bogalay, a town 90 km (50 miles) southwest of Yangon. Reflecting the scale of the disaster, the junta said it would postpone to May 24 a constitutional referendum in the worst-hit areas of Yangon and the sprawling delta. However, state TV said the May 10 vote on the charter, part of the army's much-criticized ""roadmap to democracy"", would proceed as planned in the rest of the southeast Asian nation, which has been under army rule for the last 46 years. Its political plans have been slammed by Western governments, especially after the army's bloody suppression of Buddhist-monk led protests last September. SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMELESS The government lifted states of emergency in three of the five states declared official disaster zones and some parts of the worst-hit Yangon and Irrawaddy regions. The Information Minister also said the government had sufficient stocks of rice despite damage to grain stored in the huge delta, known as the ""rice bowl of Asia"" 50 years ago when Burma was the world's largest rice exporter. The total left homeless by the 190 km (120 miles) per hour winds and storm surge is in the several hundred thousands, United Nations aid officials say. Even in delta villages that managed to withstand the worst of the winds, food and water is already running low. ""There's not much food,"" one woman at a pineapple stall in Hlaing Tha Yar, a village one hour's drive west of Yangon, told Reuters. ""The price of a cabbage is now 1,000 kyats instead of 250."" Residents of Yangon itself were queuing up for bottled water and there was still no electricity four days after the cyclone hit. Prices of food, fuel and construction materials have skyrocketed, and most shops have sold out of candles and batteries. An egg costs three times what it did on Friday. ""Generators are selling very well under the generals,"" said one man waiting outside a shop. ""MASSIVE, TERRIBLE"" The disaster drew a rare acceptance of outside help from the diplomatically isolated generals, who spurned such approaches in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Bernard Delpuech, a European Union aid official in Yangon, said the junta had sent three ships carrying food to the delta region. Nearly half the country's 53 million people live in the five disaster-hit states. Army-controlled media have made much of the military's response, showing footage of soldiers manhandling tree trunks or top generals climbing into helicopters or greeting homeless storm victims in Buddhist temples. Aid agency World Vision in Australia said it had been granted special visas to send in personnel to back up 600 staff in the impoverished Southeast Asian country. ""This is massive. It is not necessarily quite tsunami level, but in terms of impact of millions displaced, thousands dead, it is just terrible,"" World Vision Australia head Tim Costello said. ""Organizations like ours have been given permission, which is pretty unprecedented, to fly people in. This shows how grave it is in the Burmese government's mind,"" he said"
en.15.65.356.2008.5.5,US monitors to study West Bank roadblocks,"Shanon, Mon May 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States said on Monday it would send monitors to study whether the removal of Israeli roadblocks was making life easier for Palestinians in the West Bank. Flying home from a two-day trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she was confident the two sides were trying hard to resolve their six-decade conflict. Following the visit by Rice, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met on Monday to try to accelerate peace talks, which Olmert's office said had a ""very good chance"" of producing results by year-end. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat called the talks ""very serious"". Olmert's spokesman, Mark Regev, described them as ""quite possibly the most serious talks an Israeli side has ever had with the Palestinian side"". However, the meeting was overshadowed by a new criminal investigation into Olmert's affairs that has some Israeli commentators questioning his political future. The Bush administration hopes to bring about a peace deal by the end of the year but the talks have yet to show visible progress, making many on both sides wonder if they are getting anywhere. Rice spent much of her fourth trip to the region this year discussing steps to dismantle some of the hundreds of checkpoints, manned road blocks and other barriers Israel has erected across the West Bank to prevent violence. Israel argues that the barriers are necessary to prevent Palestinian suicide bombings. The Palestinians regard them as a form of collective punishment that has crippled their economy. GETTING CROPS TO MARKET After Rice's last trip in late March, Israel said it planned to remove 61 barriers in the West Bank. But a U.N. survey subsequently found that only 44 obstacles had been scrapped -- and that most of these were of little or no significance. Rice would not say how many she believed had actually been taken away but said she thought Israel was acting in good faith. She said the idea was for the monitors ""to actually talk to villagers and say, 'are you more easily able now to get your crop to market,' and if the answer to that is 'no,' it's not to say that somebody is acting in bad faith, but it's to look to see if there is another way to help villagers get that to market."" Many of the roadblocks were installed after the Palestinian uprising that erupted in September 2000 as the last major US-backed peace effort led by former President Bill Clinton collapsed. The current effort, launched by US President George W Bush at a conference in Annapolis, Maryland in November, has many obstacles, including the weakness of leaders on both sides. Rice, who held a three-way meeting with the top Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in Jerusalem on Sunday, has repeatedly said the two sides are making progress but refused to discuss the details of their talks. Washington is eager to show progress ahead of a visit later this month by Bush, who will take part in Israel's 60th anniversary celebrations. ""I've had extensive discussions with them and it has helped to build my confidence in what they are doing,"" Rice said. ""I would be the last to say that, you know, an agreement is going to pop forward tomorrow . They have got a lot of hard issues."
en.15.65.163.2008.5.3,Rice price overshadows Southeast Asian trade meeting,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Southeast Asian trade officials met on Friday for talks on how to respond to soaring rice prices, after US President George W. Bush proposed $770 million in new US food aid to stave off a global food crisis. The weekend gathering of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on the resort island of Bali, famed for its shimmering green rice terraces, is also discussing efforts to build momentum for long-delayed world trade talks. ""Our minister will talk about the rice price. We share the general concern,"" said an official from the Philippines, which is the world's top rice importer, buying about 10 percent of its annual needs from overseas. Asian rice prices have almost trebled this year and prices on the Chicago Board of Trade have risen more than 80 percent. Bush, expressing concern as rocketing world food prices intensified unrest in poor countries, promised on Thursday that the United States would take the lead as hunger takes hold of a greater swathe of the developing world. ""With the new international funding I'm announcing ... we're sending a clear message to the world that America will lead the fight against hunger for years to come,"" Bush said. The World Food Program, which has issued an emergency appeal for $755 million to help feed 73 million hungry people in 80 countries, said on Friday it was not yet sure if the new U.S. aid would resolve its funding problems. ""We will have to wait to see how this money is going to be allocated to the different agencies responsible for responding to the impact of global food prices,"" said WFP spokesman Gregory Barrow. ""But clearly this is a major step for all of us who are engaged in addressing this problem."" At the Bali talks, which conclude on Sunday and were also involving representatives from Australia, New Zealand, India and the United States, Malaysian trade minister Muhyiddin Yassin said he would press for the ""hot topic"" of food security to be higher on the agenda. ""RICE SUMMIT"" The world's biggest rice exporter, Thailand, is also at the Bali meeting of ASEAN economic ministers and an official from its delegation said the seller's perspective should also be heard. ""The cost for producers, such as fertilizer, is going up. Everything is going up,"" said the official. With only 30 million tons traded annually, government export curbs, such as those from India and Vietnam, have spooked importers such as the Philippines and Bangladesh, at a time when global stocks have halved from a record high in 2001. Media reports quoted Indian commerce minister, Kamal Nath, who is also due to attend the meeting, as saying rice exporters like India, Thailand and Vietnam had a key role and would support Bangkok convening a ""rice summit"". No other details were available. An Indian official in Bali confirmed New Delhi had floated the idea, but doubted it would be brought up at this meeting. A Thai trade official, who declined to be named, sought to soothe concerns about a further rise in rice prices, reaffirming the country's policy not to curb rice exports. ""Thailand's policy remains the same. We don't have any problem over the supply of rice,"" he said. Thailand should produce around 19 million tons of milled rice in 2008, with 7-8 million tons for local consumption and the rest for exports and stock, its agriculture ministry said. Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej recently revived talk of an ""OPEC-style"" rice cartel in Southeast Asia involving producers Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. But analysts said on Friday the idea was unlikely to gain traction. ""I don't think it would work. All they can do is agree on a price, but they can't control the supply like oil,"" said Graham Catterwell, an economic analyst with 30 years of experience in Thailand and the region. ""It's going nowhere."""
en.15.65.438.2008.5.7,Anti-government protesters block roads in Beirut,"Beirut, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Demonstrators blocked several roads in and around Beirut with burning tires on Wednesday as part of an anti-government protest backed by Lebanon's Hezbollah-led opposition, witnesses said. The main road leading to the capital's international airport was among routes blocked by the protesters. In Lebanon's worst political crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war, Hezbollah has been leading a campaign against Prime Minister Fouad Siniora's government since November 2006. The standoff has left Lebanon without a president for five months. The Syrian-backed opposition had urged supporters to back a strike by Lebanon's main labor union, which is demanding higher wages. Security forces were deployed ahead of a march called by union leaders for later on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the Western-backed government accused Hezbollah, a political group with a guerrilla army, of violating Lebanon's sovereignty by operating its own communications network and installing spy cameras at Beirut airport. The government, supported by the United States and a number of Arab countries including Saudi Arabia, also removed the head of Beirut airport security in another challenge to Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran and Syria. Hezbollah said the communications network was part of its security apparatus and had played a major role in its war with Israel in 2006. It was the only Lebanese faction allowed to keep its weapons after the civil war to fight Israeli forces occupying the south. Israel withdrew in 2000 and the fate of Hezbollah's weapons is at the heart of the political crisis."

The two chunks of 130-million-year-old coprolite, otherwise known as fossilized dinosaur dung, fetched $960 at Bonhams in New York on Wednesday, the auction house said. The Jurassic-era rocks were sold for more than double their maximum estimate, said spokeswoman Staci Smith. A 4.5 billion-year-old meteorite, on which a Chinese desert hiker habitually ate lunch before he discovered it was valuable, failed to meet the minimum reserve however. Bonhams had expected the space rock to sell for $2.25 million to $2.75 million. Smith said negotiations over the meteorite continued after the auction and that a deal could be struck in days. The owner of the meteorite, Marvin Kilgore, the curator at the University of Arizona's Southwest Meteorite Center, was mystified by the sale of the fossilized dung which is much more common than rocks that have fallen from space. ""Some people want it on their shelves, I guess,"" he said. The dung was bought by a phone bidder which the auction house declined to identify."
en.15.65.313.2008.5.3,Southeast Asian rice cartel plan 'going nowhere',"Darren Schuettler BANGKOK, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A proposed ""OPEC-style"" rice cartel in Southeast Asia will go nowhere due to the inability of governments to cooperate with each other and control output from their farmers, analysts and traders said on Friday. Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej, a TV chef whose main contact with rice is cooking it, has revived the long-dormant idea of a price-setting body involving producers Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. The proposal, which threatens to add to global food supply fears amid record high rice prices, failed to gain traction seven years ago when it was first floated by Bangkok -- and most see little chance it will fare better this time around. ""I don't think it would work. All they can do is agree on a price, but they can't control the supply like oil,"" said Graham Catterwell, an economic analyst with 30 years of experience in Thailand and the region. ""It's going nowhere."" The five mainland Southeast Asian nations produce a combined 60 million tons of milled rice each year, about 14 percent of world output. But only Thailand, the world's number one rice exporter, and Vietnam have major surpluses, last year accounting for about 47 percent of world wheat trade. ""We are all rice producers. Why don't we cooperate in managing prices?"" Samak said on Wednesday after talks with visiting Myanmar Prime Minister Thein Sein. Samak said Thein Sein had agreed in principle to the idea, but the Burmese general did not speak to reporters. Myanmar has resumed limited rice exports this year, mainly to South Asia, after several years off the market, trade sources say. The proposed group -- which includes two democracies, two Communist-led governments and a military dictatorship -- appears in no hurry to hammer out the details. Agriculture ministers will discuss the proposal in September at a meeting of the 10-nation ASEAN regional group in Vietnam, Cambodian Agriculture Minister Chan Sarun said on Friday. Impoverished Cambodia, where 85 percent of a 14 million population are farmers, would join if a cartel offered technology benefits like better seed to boost output, he said. Cambodia produced 6.7 million tons of rice in 2007-08, of which 1.5 million tons went for export, well below the nearly 9 million tons Thailand will ship this year. Like several other big suppliers including Vietnam and India, Cambodia slapped restrictions on exports this year in an effort to secure domestic supply and keep local prices down. ""We must produce more rice to sell to overseas markets,"" Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen recently said on state television. OUT OF CONTROL Sharing technology is one thing. It's quite another to set prices and control output like the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), whose member nations have often had trouble singing from the same song sheet even though they pump over a third of the world's oil. ""It's impossible. We can't fix prices as OPEC does because we can't control our production like OPEC,"" Chookiat Ophaswongse, President of the Thai Rice Exporters Association, told Reuters. ""It might be easy for Communist Laos or Vietnam to control their farmers, but we can't do that in a free-market economy like Thailand. Farmers will rush to grow more rice when prices go up and shift to other crops when prices fall,"" he said. Catterwell said the five countries may agree on a broad price band, but it would be hard to enforce and buyers could go elsewhere, such as India, which can export as much as 5 million tons of rice annually. Even Samak appears to have moved on from the price-setting idea, as he was quoted as saying on Friday he was willing to sell rice to Indonesia at a ""friendly price"". Thailand first floated the cartel idea in 2001 when it feared losing market share because its export price was around $40 a ton higher than Vietnam, India and Pakistan. The proposal fizzled out then, and it appears likely to suffer a similar fate this time around. ""With an oil well, you can just turn the pumps on and off. You can set quotas for how much to produce, but how do you do that with rice farmers all over the country?,"" Catterwell said."

The total left homeless by the 190 km (120 miles) per hour winds and 12 foot (3.5 meter) storm surge is in the several hundred thousands, United Nations aid officials say.

""We were negotiating a way to find common ground and then on Saturday they chose to walk away,"" said the 39-year-old co-founder of the pioneering Internet company.

Yang held out for $37 per share, saying that even the sweetened offer did not value Yahoo properly for its Web search advertising technology, its prominence in selling display ads and its lucrative overseas holdings. But its two largest shareholders independently told The New York Times they would have sold for as little as $34. ""I am extremely angry at Jerry Yang and at the so-called independent board,"" Gordon Crawford, portfolio manager for Capital Research Global Investors, the largest Yahoo shareholder with some 16 percent of stock, told the newspaper. Some analysts said Yahoo shares, which dropped $4.30 to end at $24.37 on Monday, could have fallen 30 percent to closer to $19.18, its price before Microsoft made its bid public on February 1. But the descent was cushioned by investors who are betting Microsoft will eventually come back to the table. ""This is going to play out over the next several months and there is still a chance Microsoft will buy the company for somewhere around $33 a share,"" said Todd Dagres, general partner at venture capital fund Spark Capital. A GOOGLE VICTORY? Shares of Microsoft rose initially on investor relief that it was not paying billions more for Yahoo, though the stock ended down slightly amid concerns about how the software maker would develop its Web strategy in the face of a dominant Google Inc. Microsoft courted Yahoo to capitalize on the rapidly growing market for Internet advertising, one that has long been served by Yahoo's search, e-mail and Web communities. It is also trying to fend off the expansion of Google, which has made inroads into Microsoft's home turf with a portfolio of Web based-applications, e-mail and messaging. But now that a deal has fallen apart, Google has emerged as the key beneficiary. Shares in the company rose 2.3 percent. ""Google has just kept their foot on the accelerator,"" said Derek Brown, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ""Neither Yahoo nor Microsoft in their current state seems to be a material competitive threat."" Yahoo is likely to press alternative strategies in coming weeks, including a search advertising partnership with Google and a deal for Time Warner Inc's AOL Internet unit. A Google deal would boost Yahoo's operating performance in the near term, but runs the risk of regulatory scrutiny over an alliance between the Internet's top two players. Google and Yahoo are hammering out the intricacies of a potential deal and also are sharing their plans with antitrust regulators, a person close to Google who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter said. In a letter to Yang over the weekend, Ballmer warned that any deal between Yahoo and Google would be difficult to unravel and would preclude an agreement with Microsoft. Yang told Reuters the company would take care to structure any new efforts to ""preserve as much (as possible) long-term flexibility for Yahoo, both operationally and strategically."" SHAREHOLDER PRESSURE Analysts expect a flurry of shareholder lawsuits against Yahoo, and say it may even face direct pressure on its board. Already, some Yahoo shareholders have started to question how talks were handled. Bill Miller, a portfolio manager for Legg Mason, Yahoo's second-largest shareholder, told the New York Times in a Sunday interview that he would have considered selling to Microsoft for $34 or $35 a share. While that was more than Microsoft's offer, it was less than the $37 per share Yahoo's board had insisted on. Capital Research's Crawford also said investors generally were looking for Yahoo to sell at $34. He hoped shareholders pushed Yahoo to revisit the issue but was not optimistic, he told the newspaper. The company owns about 16 percent of Yahoo. Yang, who owns about 4 percent of the company, was expected to hold a meeting with employees on Tuesday in an effort to reassure staff in the wake of the Microsoft talks ending. Yang said in a post on the company's blog on Sunday night: ""No one is celebrating about the outcome of these past three months ... and no one should. We live and work in a competitive world and the Web is only going to get more competitive. Executing on our strategic plan is what matters most."

en.15.65.209.2008.5.5,Iraq says to document Iran `interference`,"Baghdad, May 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has ordered the formation of a committee to compile evidence of Iranian ""interference"" in Iraq that will then be presented to Tehran, the government spokesman said on Sunday. Spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh was speaking a day after a delegation from Iraq's ruling Shi'ite alliance returned from Tehran after showing Iranian officials evidence of the Islamic Republic's backing of Shi'ite militias in Iraq. Dabbagh said Iranian officials who met that delegation had denied any meddling in Iraq. ""The prime minister has ordered the formation of a committee to document the interference of the Iranians in Iraqi affairs. The Iraqi government will follow up with the Iranians and put (these findings) in front of them,"" Dabbagh told Reuters. At an earlier news conference Dabbagh appeared to distance the government from U.S. accusations of Iranian interference in Iraq. He had said Iraq would not be pushed into conflict with its neighbor and wanted its own inquiry to find ""tangible information and not information based on speculation."" Asked by Reuters what evidence existed so far, Dabbagh said Iranian missiles had been found in the southern city of Basra during a recent crackdown on militias in the southern city. ""The proof we have is weapons which are shown to be made in Iran. We want to trace back how they reached (Iraq), who is using them, where are they getting it,"" Dabbagh said. Washington accuses Iran of funding, arming and training Shi'ite militias to attack U.S.-led troops and Iraqi government forces, despite its public commitment to stabilizing Iraq. Tehran blames the violence on the presence of U.S. forces The U.S. military said last week ""very, very significant"" amounts of Iranian arms had been found in Basra and also Baghdad during an offensive against militiamen loyal to anti-American Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr that began in late March. Some of those arms were made in 2008, the military said. U.S. military officials had planned to display some of the weapons but decided to let the Iraqis make their own case to Iran first. Dabbagh said the government committee would be comprised of representatives of the various security ministries. NO PROXY WAR The Iraqis have repeatedly said they do not want their territory to become a battleground for a proxy war between the United States and Iran. The arch-foes are at loggerheads over Iran's nuclear ambitions. ""We don't want to be pushed into any conflict with any neighboring countries, especially Iran. What happened before is enough. We paid a lot,"" Dabbagh told the earlier news conference, referring to the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war in which an estimated 1 million people died. ""It happened because the others pushed Iraq to take an aggressive stance with Iran. We want to organize relations with all neighboring countries to preserve the interests of Iraq."" Ties between Iran and Iraq have improved since Sunni Arab strongman Saddam Hussein was ousted in the U.S.-led invasion and a Shi'ite-led government came to power in Baghdad. Analysts say Tehran wants to keep a friendly, Shi'ite-led government in charge but also wants to ensure rival Iraqi Shi'ite factions look to Iran as a power broker. Iran's ISNA news agency said on Sunday Iran backed efforts by the Iraqi government to disarm militias and would ""make its utmost efforts to establish security in Iraq"". The U.S. military said on Sunday it killed nine militants in helicopter strikes overnight in eastern Baghdad, where battles have raged between troops and Sadr's Mehdi Army fighters. Much of the fighting took place in and around the crowded Shi'ite slum of Sadr City, the cleric's stronghold in Baghdad. Despite an overall improvement in Iraq's security, levels of violence are still high. The wife of Iraq's president, Jalal Talabani, escaped a roadside bomb attack on her convoy near the national theatre in central Baghdad in which four security guards were wounded. Gunmen also shot dead a journalist in the northern city of Mosul after pulling her out of a taxi. A colleague said she had received a text message on her mobile phone three weeks ago warning her to stop reporting."
en.15.65.314.2008.4.30,"Afghan forces kill 2 Taliban, woman, child in siege","KABUL, Wed Apr 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan security forces surrounded a house in the capital Kabul on Wednesday and traded gunfire with Taliban insurgents before blowing up the building and killing two militants as well as a woman and child inside, officials said. Earlier, an Interior Ministry official had said five Taliban militants blew themselves up in the house. The two dead Taliban fighters were involved in a botched attempt to assassinate President Hamid Karzai on Sunday, but they had also received help from some government officials, senior ministers and a security official told a news conference. ""Investigations make clear that the enemy had infiltrated to some extent into some of our security organs and those involved have been arrested with all their networks,"" said Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak. The identities of those who helped facilitate the attack would be revealed after the president's approval, said the head of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), Amrullah Saleh. Taliban gunmen fired rocket-propelled grenades and small arms at a state parade on Sunday sending President Hamid Karzai, his cabinet and the military top brass diving for cover. Three people were shot dead the before troops killed three Taliban attackers. Members of parliament as well as the Afghan public at large have questioned how the Afghan police and NDS could have allowed such a breach of security at such a high-profile event. While the Taliban have carried out sporadic suicide bombings in Kabul before, Sunday's attack, together with a guerrilla-style assault on a five-star hotel in the capital in January, indicate a more sophisticated mode of attack, designed to grab headlines. The same Taliban network was behind both attacks, Interior Minister Zarar Ahmad Moqbel said. Afghan security forces surrounded the house on a hillside close to the old city during the night following tip-offs from those arrested after Sunday's violence, Wardak said. After about 10 hours of battling the militants, NDS officers blew up the house killing the two Taliban fighters and a woman and child inside, Saleh said. The Taliban have vowed to target Kabul this year as part of their campaign to overthrow Karzai's government and drive out the more than 50,000 foreign troops stationed in the country. Afghan and international troops have steadily clawed back almost all of the towns in the south and east, but Taliban rebels are still active in much of the countryside. US Marines captured a town centre from Taliban insurgents in the southern Afghan province of Helmand on Wednesday, their first large operation in Afghanistan since arriving to reinforce NATO troops last month. Washington sent the 3,200 Marines to southern Afghanistan to bolster British, Canadian and Dutch forces engaged in daily battles with Taliban militants there after other NATO allies failed to come up with large numbers of extra combat troops. Taliban fighters fled Kabul in late 2001 to escape a US-led aerial onslaught and a ground assault by Afghan militia. In the years immediately after 2001, the Taliban regrouped and two years ago relaunched their insurgency with guerrilla attacks on Afghan and international troops mainly in the south and east, backed by suicide bombs across the countr"
en.15.65.108.2008.5.5,Dig to uncover a lost city in Wari-Bateshwar,"Sanjay Dey bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)It is an archaeological dig into the past to find an old city frozen in time. Wari and Bateshwar are two remote villages in Belabo upazila of Narsingdi where students of Jahangirnagar University's archaeology department, led by Prof Sufi Mostafizur Rahman, have been searching for the rich city for the last eight years. The team has already found the city surrounded by a wall in Wari village as well as several archaeological artefacts in Bateshwar village. Of the old human habitations so far discovered in Bangladesh, Prof Rahman claimed, Wari-Bateshwar were the oldest. He was of the opinion that the habitat surrounded by the wall was likely to be a lost fort city. The formal search for artefacts in Wari village first started in 2000. Prof Rahman said a local schoolteacher, Hanif Pathan, had started collecting scattered artefacts from different areas of the village since the 1930s. His son Habibullah Pathan also joined in the work. Habibullah also wrote in different newspapers of the archaeological prospects in Wari- Bateshwar. But the archaeologists did not give the matter much importance. In connection with the writings of Habibullah Pathan, Prof Dilip Kumar Chakravarty went to Wari- Bateshwar in 1989. Three years later, in an article he recognised the presence of an ancient habitation in the area. The article interested Prof Rahman. He started a primary search in 1996. But several more years elapsed before his embarking on an excavation drive due to lack of necessary funds and workforce coupled with hindrance at different levels. In the archaeological excavation in Wari- Bateshwar, the existence of two forts has so far been found, one of them locally known as ""Asam Rajar Garh"". Prof Rahman thinks the Asam Rajar Garh might have been constructed as part of the first level of defence for the main fort in the Wari area. In the primary survey conducted by his team, it was found that on the south-west of the main fort was ""Asam Rajar Garh"". On the north is the Koira river and Arial Kha river in the east. Prof Rahman claimed that the Wari Fort city was about 2,500 years old. The fort was built at the beginning of the second phase of urbanisation in the Ganges Valley (450 BC) after urbanisation at Harappa (2700-1700 BC). ""We confirmed this by examining (carbon dating) different samples of archaeological finds. The age of another archaeological site in Bangladesh Mahasthangarh is about 100 years younger than this,"" he said. ""At the start of the excavation, we found a road built of lime and bricks. It astounded many, as archaeologists did not believe such style of construction started in the area before the Muslim rule. But it was proved that after Harappa, use of lime and bricks started in the beginning of the second phase of urbanisation,"" Prof Rahman said. Speaking of the characteristics of the old habitation of Wari-Bateshwar, Prof Rahman said: ""It was a fort city. A high mud wall and deep trenches surrounded its four sides. Proof we have got so far indicates that a labour-based society was developed."" The labourers were mainly involved in ornament and mud-based work. From the artefacts found here, it also seems that the city had a commercial link with the Roman Empire. Discovery of large number of silver coins also proves the importance of the city as a commercial centre. Prof Rahman said that 47 archaeological sites had so far been found in and around the fort city at Wari. ""It is said that outside the city lived the farming community. Their agricultural products met the demand of the inhabitants of the fort city."" Proof of pit habitation was found in Wari fort city during the 2005 excavation. ""This was the first proof of the existence of such a habitation in Bangladesh,"" he said. Prof Rahman was of the opinion that the small pits were used to preserve crops. He said that such a habitation has earlier been discovered in Inamgaon in Maharasthra of India. Showing the design on mud pot, Prof Rahman said, ""Such designs are found only in old Roman art. So the possibility of a link between the Roman culture and Wari-Bateshwar cannot be ruled out. Besides, specimens of many amulets have been found. Such amulets were put entombed with mummies in old Egypt."" At present, the team is carrying out excavation of a piece of architecture made of inverted pyramid-shaped bricks. It could not be ascertained exactly why the 32 feet by 18 feet structure had been built. Two teachers of the University of Asia Pacific Architecture Department Dr Abu Sayeed Mostaque Ahmed and associate professor Ziaul Islam visited the site on Thursday. A group of students of the University also accompanied them. On the architecture, Ziaul Islam said, ""There is novelty in its structure. It might have been used as a water reservoir. It might also have been used for reverence."" Prof Rahman started excavation work on a limited scale at Wari fort city with the financial assistance of International Centre for Practice of Bengal Art. He also added some money from his own income to the project. Students of different batches of archaeology of Jahangirnagar University are also providing assistance in the excavation work on the 600-square kilometre archaeological site. The excavation work was carried forward in 2004 with money from the Asiatic Society fellowship and the next two years with the financial assistance of Grameenphone. This year Prime Bank is providing financial assistance. Excavation work will continue through May. Prof Rahman said that the overall work for archaeological artefacts in Wari-Bateshwar area required a large sum of money as well as modern technology. So nothing on such a big scale was available. ""I went to the then local government minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan in 2005 for money for excavation work. After about five months, he told be about his inability,"" he said. Describing his experience, Prof Rahman said: ""At the time we were neglected by different quarters. However, the local people always cooperated. Many gave up their land for the excavation work."" ""Archaeologists and officials of the Directorate of Archaeology had no idea about the existence of such a site here, whereas two local schoolteachers drew attention to it. We are carrying out excavation in Wari-Bateshwar involving local people,"" he said. Local inhabitant Rafiqul Islam echoed Prof Rahman. Excavation is now going on the land given up by Rafiqul Islam. ""Earlier, if we found any artefacts, we would sell it, but now we will not do that, but rather preserve it."" bdnews"
en.15.65.73.2008.5.4,Hollywood actors and studios extend labor talks again,"LOS ANGELES, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Screen Actors Guild and major Hollywood studios said on Friday they had agreed to extend their contract talks again, this time on a day-by-day basis, with the aim of closing a deal by next Tuesday. The announcement, coming as the parties neared a previous self-imposed deadline, revived hopes they could avoid renewed labor unrest in an entertainment industry still recovering from a 100-day screenwriters strike that ended in February. The current three-year SAG contract covering 120,000 film and TV actors expires on June 30. But the union is under strong pressure to reach an early settlement in order to dispel strike jitters that continue to disrupt the film industry. By prior agreement, SAG and the studios' bargaining agent, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, had planned to keep their sessions going through Friday, capping nearly three weeks of talks. At midday, however, the two sides issued a brief notice saying they would ""extend their negotiations on a day-to-day basis"" through next Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. PDT (8:00 p.m. EDT), with a day off on Sunday. There was no further comment from either party. But sources familiar with the course of negotiations said SAG had scaled back a number of demands considered major stumbling blocks. In one such concession, they said, the union was now seeking what would effectively be a 15 percent increase in residual payments actors earn from DVDs, rather than a doubling of the DVD residual rate. Striking writers were forced to give up demands for higher DVD residuals altogether in reaching their contract deal with studios more than two months ago. That agreement ultimately hinged on new payments the writers gained for film and TV work delivered over the Internet, an area that actors were hoping to improve upon in their own labor talks with producers. SAG, for example, is reported to be seeking to shorten the three-week window during which studios can stream certain TV programs online without paying residuals to union talent. But SAG scaled back its demand for a 50 percent pay increase for guest stars on TV shows, according to the Los Angeles Times. SAG and the studios opened talks April 15 and initially set out to reach an accord in two weeks. But they decided eight days into the negotiations to stay at the bargaining table for a third week, through Friday, to allow more time to narrow what the studios then called ""significant gaps."" Earlier this week the studios declared little progress had been made and that unreasonable SAG demands were to blame. The latest word from the talks signaled a determination by the two sides to avoid a repetition of the acrimony that erupted over the Writers Guild of America contract. The WGA's 14-week strike, Hollywood's worst labor clash in 20 years, shut down much of the TV industry, derailed several film productions and idled thousands of Hollywood workers, costing the local economy an estimated $3 billion. Hollywood has been treating SAG's contract expiration as a de facto strike deadline, with film studios unwilling to launch any production they could not finish before June 30 for fear that an actual walkout by actors might materialize by then. SAG's smaller sister union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), agreed to delay the scheduled start of its own, separate contract talks with studios in order to accommodate the Screen Actors Guild. AFTRA, whose 70,000 members include about 44,000 who also hold SAG cards, is widely seen as more inclined to reach a labor deal quickly, putting additional pressure on SAG's more militant leaders to come to terms with the studios."
en.15.65.183.2008.5.1,Obama hurt by furor over ex pastor: polls,"Washington, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's loss in the Pennsylvania primary and the political firestorm over his former pastor have cut into his lead over rival Hillary Clinton among Democratic voters, according to polls released on Wednesday. According to a New York Times/CBS News poll, 51 percent of Democratic voters now say they expect Obama to win their party's nomination. That's an 18 point-slide from a month ago when 69 percent said they expected Obama to take on Republican John McCain in the November presidential election. The latest survey found that 48 percent of Democrats believe Obama, an Illinois senator, has a better chance of beating McCain than Clinton, a New York senator, versus 56 percent a month ago. The poll was conducted Friday through Tuesday, before Obama strongly denounced his former pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, for making racially charged comments that roiled the Illinois senator's presidential campaign. Obama's campaign was engulfed by the Wright controversy after a nearly 10-point loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary early this month. The Times/CBS poll also found that Democrats see no early end to the Obama-Clinton battle. About 70 percent of Democratic voters predict that their party's nominee will not be decided before the party's national nominating convention in August, the newspaper said. A majority of Democrats also said the protracted primary race will eventually hurt the Democratic Party's chances against McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona, in the general election. The nationwide telephone poll was conducted with 1,065 adults and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points over all, and plus or minus 5 percentage points among Democrats alone. A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that some voters feel McCain better reflects their values than the Democratic candidates. Fifty-four percent of respondents said that they identify with McCain's background and his set of values, compared with 35 percent who didn't feel that connection. In the survey, 45 percent said they identify with Obama's values, down 5 points from last month when 50 percent of voters said they identified with his background and values, versus 39 percent who did not. The decline seems to suggest that the cover over his former pastor his comment about ""bitter"" small-town America clinging to guns and religion have had a negative impact, NBC said. On the background/values question, Obama's score fell among small-town/rural voters from 46 percent support to 31 percent. Among elderly voters, Obama dropped from 52 percent identifying with his values to 36 percent. The poll of 1,006 registered voters was conducted from Friday through Monday and has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points."
en.15.65.349.2008.5.4,Crunch time for Serbs in EU vs Kosovo election,"Belgrade, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The final week of campaigning began for Serbia's most crucial election in the post-Slobodan Milosevic era, with every sign that divisions over the country's future course are deepening. The coalition that toppled the late strongman is now fragmented, divided over allegiance to the West or Russia, and calling each other traitors and liars. The balance of power shifted to the nationalists since Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who beat Milosevic in 2000 as a pro-Western moderate, became increasingly hardline over the secession of Kosovo with U.S. and European Union backing. ""Our principles are for the survival of Kosovo in Serbia, for the survival of Serbia itself,"" he said this week, accusing his erstwhile allies, the pro-Western Democratic Party, of treason for signing a pre-membership pact with Brussels. ""Now when they're trying to take away a piece of the country's territory, when its heart is being ripped out and a pact with the EU offered in return, one can't deny that this election will determine Serbia's destiny."" His campaign around the slogan of ""Uphold Serbia"" echoes 19th century romantic nationalism and the introspection and paranoia of the 1990s. 'Yankee Go Home' leaflets show how far the party has strayed from its pro-Western roots. It has been striking similar notes as the nationalist Radicals, whose platform of Serbian dignity and a non-aligned path between East and West have made it the strongest single party for the last five years. Their main common position is over Kosovo: Radical leader Tomislav Nikolic has said Serbia should not ""sell itself"" and join the EU until it gets back its cherished province, cradle of its Orthodox faith. ""We can work together as friends, but hands off our territory,"" Nikolic said in a campaign speech. ""If you think Kosovo must be independent, forget Serbia as the place where you'll make money"". COALITION The convergence between Kostunica and Nikolic has Serbs forecasting a coalition, making the Democrats the only party that hold up the tide of new nationalism and a shift away from Europe and towards Moscow, Serbia's main backer over Kosovo. Totally sidelined by Kostunica during the eight months of their fragile government and playing second fiddle to his rhetoric on Kosovo, they are now fighting back. Their campaign includes grainy gray footage of poverty and isolation during the Milosevic years, and a technicolor alternative version of a prosperous 'European Serbia' of well-dressed young people with perfect smiles and big plans. ""We need to tie our little boat to the big European ship,"" deputy PM Bozidar Djelic of the Democrats said on Tuesday while signing the accord with the EU. ""I'm a Serb patriot and I'm convinced today is a truly patriotic day."" The pact was offered by Brussels explicitly to boost the Democrats. It will remain mostly symbolic until Serbia fulfils conditions for ratification by arresting war crimes fugitives from the Yugoslav wars, and then starts to reap the benefits. Slogans aside, polls show that to clinch a majority and prevent the Radicals from coming to power, the Democrats may need a helping hand from a party of the past. Serbian media are speculating that the Democrats have done the math and swallowed their pride, and are already making overtures to the Socialists, the once-dominant party of Milosevic."
en.15.65.199.2008.5.4,China seeking `positive outcome` from Tibet talks,"Shenzhen, China, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's president said he was hoping for a ""positive outcome"" from talks with envoys of the Dalai Lama, which were due to open on Sunday, but state media kept up a barrage of attacks on Tibet's exiled spiritual leader. ""I hope that the contacts with the Dalai Lama's side from today will yield a positive outcome,"" Hu Jintao told Japanese reporters in Beijing, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported. The fence-mending talks between Chinese officials and the two aides of the Dalai Lama, the first since an eruption of Tibetan protests and deadly riots in March, were scheduled to start on Sunday in the city of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong. The unrest, the most serious challenge to Chinese rule in the mountainous region for nearly two decades, prompted anti-China protests around the world that disrupted the international leg of the Olympic torch relay and led to calls for Western leaders to boycott August's Beijing Games. Security was tight outside the Shenzhen state guest house where the talks were to be held, and reporters were not allowed into the compound. The official news agency Xinhua identified the Chinese negotiators as Zhu Weiqun and Sitar, both vice-ministers of the Communist Party's United Front Work and responsible for winning over religious leaders and ethnic minorities. Lodi Gyari and Kelsang Gyaltsen, the Dalai Lama's representatives in Washington and Switzerland respectively, arrived in China on Saturday. A commentary in the Tibet Daily, mouthpiece of the Tibet regional government, accused the Dalai Lama of being a ""loyal tool of international anti-Chinese forces"". Accusing the Nobel peace laureate of being the leader of a political group plotting to split Tibet from China, it said he was ""colluding with international anti-Chinese forces to spread rumors and slander to disrupt and sabotage the Olympic torch relay"". EXPECTATIONS LOW China ""hoped ... the Dalai side will take credible moves to stop activities aimed at splitting China"", stop plotting and inciting violence and stop disrupting and sabotaging the Beijing Olympic Games so as to create conditions for talks"", Xinhua said, quoting an unnamed official. Some analysts said the repeated condemnations in the run-up to the talks suggested that China was in no mood to compromise following the riots in Tibet, which stoked Western criticism of its rule there. Chhime Chhoekyapa, a senior aide to the Dalai Lama, said on Saturday that the India-based Tibetan government-in-exile ""can't have great expectations"" from the talks. There have been six rounds of dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama's envoys since 2002, with no breakthrough. China proposed the latest talks last month after Western governments urged it to open new dialogue with the Dalai Lama, who says he wants a high level of autonomy, not independence, for the predominantly Buddhist Himalayan homeland he fled in 1959. The Dalai Lama also says that he objects to violence and supports the Beijing Olympics. China says he is insincere. China says the rioting in Tibet's capital, Lhasa, in March killed 18 ""innocent civilians"" and a police officer. It has not specified how many, if any, protesters have died but says troops used maximum restraint and avoided using lethal weapons. Exiled groups say many more Tibetans have died in a crackdown on rioters. The government-in-exile estimated last week that 203 Tibetans might have died in the unrest since March 10."
en.15.65.13.2008.5.5,Iran calls new talks with US on Iraq meaningless,"Tehran, Mon May 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran accused US-led forces on Monday of a ""massacre"" of the Iraqi people and said further talks with Washington about improving security in its neighbour would be meaningless now. The Foreign Ministry statement effectively puts on hold any new meetings between the two old foes, which last year held three rounds of ground-breaking discussions in Baghdad, easing a diplomatic freeze lasting almost three decades. Iraq has repeatedly said it does not want its soil to become a battleground for a proxy war between the United States and Iran, which are also at loggerheads over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iraqi officials have expressed growing frustration that a fourth round of talks has failed to get off the ground. ""Right now, what we observe in Iraq is a massacre of the Iraqi nation by the occupying forces,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told a news conference. ""Concerning this situation, talks with America will have no results and will be meaningless."" Hosseini did not elaborate, but US forces have been fighting daily battles with militiamen loyal to anti-American Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in Baghdad for several weeks. Washington accuses Iran of funding, arming and training ""rogue"" elements of Sadr's Mehdi Army to attack US and Iraqi forces, despite its public commitment to stabilizing Iraq. Tehran blames the violence on the US presence in Iraq. A spokesman for the US embassy in Baghdad said the United States had been willing for some time to have another round of talks with Iran, which have been organized by the Iraqi government. ""The Iranians have repeatedly found excuses not to come to the table. Now we see Iran attempting to shift attention away from its ongoing destabilizing activities in Iraq,"" he said. ""We remain open to further talks if it becomes clear that Iran is taking constructive steps to end the flow of arms and demonstrate its positive intentions toward Iraq."" On Sunday, in response to earlier remarks by an unnamed Iranian official who said Tehran saw no need for more talks because of US military action, the Iraqi government's spokesman said this should not concern Tehran. ""This is an internal issue,"" spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said, adding Baghdad wanted the two arch foes to hold more talks. Despite the mutual accusations, US and Iranian officials had launched talks in May last year aimed at easing bloodshed in Iraq. The fourth meeting has been postponed repeatedly. The first three meetings were mainly aimed to break the ice but did also reach a deal to set up a joint security committee. SUPPORT FOR MALIKI The Iranian Foreign Ministry also voiced support for Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in cracking down on ""illegal"" Shia militias, after an Iraqi delegation urged Tehran to stop backing such groups. The US military said last week ""very, very significant"" amounts of Iranian arms had been found in Basra and Baghdad during an offensive against gunmen loyal to Sadr. Maliki has ordered the formation of a committee to compile evidence of Iranian ""interference"" in Iraq that would then be presented to Tehran, Dabbagh said on Sunday. He said Iranian officials who met a visiting Iraqi delegation last week had denied any meddling in Iraq, and Hosseini said Tehran had always supported stability there. ""What Iran has repeatedly said ... was its support for Mr Maliki's government,"" Hosseini said. ""Iran believes that illegal armed groups that committed crimes should be legally confronted."" Ties between Iran and Iraq have improved since Sunni Arab strongman Saddam Hussein was ousted in the US-led invasion and a Shi'ite-led government came to power in Baghdad. Analysts say Tehran wants to keep a friendly government in charge but also wants to ensure rival Iraqi Shia factions look to Iran as a power broker"
en.15.65.389.2008.5.4,US rocket strike in Baghdad wounds 20,"BAGHDAD, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The U.S. military fired rockets at a target near a major hospital in eastern Baghdad on Saturday, wounding 20 people and damaging several ambulances, the head of the hospital said. No patients were wounded at the hospital in the Sadr City stronghold of anti-American Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, but 20 people at the scene of the blasts had been hurt, said Dr. Wi'am al-Jawahiri, manager of al-Sadr hospital. Jawahiri said windows at the hospital were shattered when three missiles hit what the U.S. military in Iraq called a militant ""command and control"" centre around 10 a.m. ""While I believe the target was not the hospital, we could have been informed before they did such a thing. At least we could have taken some precautions,"" Jawahiri told Reuters. The U.S. military said precision-guided munitions were used to destroy the militant facility in Sadr City, where U.S. and Iraqi forces have been battling Shi'ite gunmen loyal to Sadr for several weeks as part of a big government crackdown on militias. Such weapons could either be rockets fired from launchers on the ground or helicopters. Colonel Jerry O'Hara, a U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad, said the operation was ""time sensitive"" and targeted a ""command and control"" centre that was used to plan attacks against the Iraqi people as well as Iraqi and U.S. security forces. ""We take great care to prevent any collateral damage and will continue to do so. We don't target civilians and regret any casualties,"" O'Hara said. Asked why a missile strike was launched so close to the hospital during the middle of the morning, he said: ""The real question should be why these criminal elements seem to always put the Iraqi people at risk by using facilities to coordinate their attacks so close to public places."" A ""battle damage assessment"" was being carried out, he said. Reuters Television pictures showed a destroyed building not far from the hospital, one of two main medical facilities in the crowded Shi'ite slum of Sadr City, home to 2 million people. Several ambulances were badly damaged, along with a number of civilian cars. MORE CLASHES OVERNIGHT The latest attack came after a night of more violence in Sadr City. The U.S. military said American and Iraqi forces killed 14 gunmen in battles overnight. Hospital officials said 14 people had been killed and 25 wounded following the clashes. It was not immediately clear if the dead and wounded were gunmen or civilians. The U.S. military has been carrying out air strikes on gunmen nearly every day in the militia bastion since fighting erupted more than a month ago. It says militants have fired more than 700 rockets and mortars at various targets during that period, mostly at the Green Zone government and diplomatic compound. The U.S. military blames rogue elements of Sadr's Mehdi Army militia for the rocket fire. It accuses Iran of arming, funding and training those militants, a charge Tehran denies. A delegation from Iraq's ruling Shi'ite alliance was sent to Tehran this week to tell Iran to stop backing Shi'ite militias fighting security forces, members of the alliance have said. The delegation returned to Baghdad on Saturday. In a brief statement on Iraq's al-Furat television, the head of the delegation, deputy parliamentary speaker Khalid al-Attiya, said Iran supported Baghdad in its fight against militants. Attiya did not mention the U.S. accusations. ""The delegation saw a positive stance from the brothers in Iran to support the government's efforts in extending the sovereignty of the state and to fight the outlaws,"" Attiya said. The U.S. military said this week that ""very, very significant"" amounts of Iranian weaponry had been found in the southern city of Basra and also Baghdad during an offensive against militiamen in those cities that began in late March. U.S. military officials had planned to put on display some of the recently captured weapons but decided to let the Iraqis make their own case to Iran first. Four U.S. Marines were killed by a roadside bomb in the western province of Anbar on Friday, the U.S. military said in a statement."
en.15.65.197.2008.5.1,Man United and Chelsea turn focus to title chase,"LONDON, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United and Chelsea, who meet in next month's Champions League final in Moscow, will focus on matters much closer to home this weekend when they renew their battle for the Premier League title. United beat Barcelona 1-0 on Tuesday and Chelsea edged Liverpool 3-2 after extra time a day later to complete the line-up of the first all-English final of the Champions League. On the domestic front, where there are two matches left to play, Chelsea pulled level with leaders United on 81 points by beating the champions 2-1 at Stamford Bridge last week. Chelsea now travel to face a revitalised Newcastle United on Monday while United host West Ham United on Saturday. A win for Alex Ferguson's men would clearly increase the pressure on Chelsea at St James' Park, particularly as United already have a far superior goal difference. Looking further ahead, United's final league game is at Wigan Athletic on May 11 while Chelsea play Bolton Wanderers at home on the same day. Along with the title and the battle to avoid the drop, the race for next season's UEFA Cup places is also set to go to the last day of the season. Derby County's relegation fate was sealed back in March, but the wider scramble to avoid the drop zone has grown in intensity over the last four weeks. RELEGATION SCRAP Five clubs are left in the relegation scrapFulham (30 points), Birmingham City (32), Reading (33), Bolton Wanderers (33) and even 15th-placed Middlesbrough (36). Fulham flirted with relegation last weekend until they rallied superbly from 2-0 down to beat Manchester City 3-2 and other results went the west London club's way. Fulham survived to fight another day and now face Birmingham at Craven Cottage on Saturday. Reading, who are 17th and have not scored a goal for five matches, host Tottenham Hotspur after their astonishing match at White Hart Lane in December which Spurs won 6-4. Reading's survival is already in some serious doubt, but it will be even tougher unless they end their goal drought quickly. Bolton, who are 16th and have beaten West Ham and Middlesbrough as well as drawing with Spurs in their last three games, now face Sunderland, who made sure of their survival with a win over Middlesbrough in last week's Tyne-Wear derby. Middlesbrough, who are probably safe despite the mathematical possibility of going down, host Portsmouth, who are playing as if they already have one eye on their FA Cup final date with Cardiff City on May 17. Arsenal, four points adrift in third but who can still theoretically win the title, face Everton at the Emirates on Sunday. The visitors are battling Aston Villa for fifth spot and the automatic UEFA Cup place. Villa could climb above Everton on goal difference if they beat Wigan Athletic at Villa Park on Saturday"
en.15.65.385.2008.5.5,"Study links child`s autism, parents` mental illness","Chicago, May 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In another sign pointing to an inherited component to autism, a study released on Monday found that having a schizophrenic parent or a mother with psychiatric problems roughly doubled a child's risk of being autistic. ""Our research shows that mothers and fathers diagnosed with schizophrenia were about twice as likely to have a child diagnosed with autism,"" said Julie Daniels of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who worked on the study. ""We also saw higher rates of depression and personality disorders among mothers, but not fathers,"" she said in a statement. The study of families in Sweden with children born between 1977 and 2003 involved 1,227 children diagnosed with autism. They were compared with families of nearly 31,000 children who did not have autism. Sweden's detailed health registry provides a wealth of data for such studies. Autism, which is marked by impaired social interaction and communication, or a related disorder like Asperger's syndrome, affects an estimated one out of every 150 U.S. children, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. Asperger's is marked by mild social awkwardness. No one knows what causes autism, but researchers think it is likely that several genes and possibly environmental factors contribute. Some autism advocates believe childhood vaccinations play a role, although most medical experts say it is extremely unlikely. Which genes lie behind various mental illnesses are also poorly understood, according to the researchers, whose study appeared in the journal Pediatrics, published by the American Academy of Pediatrics. ""Earlier studies have shown a higher rate of psychiatric disorders in families of autistic children than in the general population,"" Daniels said. The association between a child's autism and mental illness in the parent was strongest with schizophrenia, and was less powerful when the mother suffered from depression or personality disorders. There was little association between autism and parental addiction to alcohol or drugs or some other types of mental illness. It was not clear if it was significant that having a mother, but not a father, with certain mental illnesses, raised the risk of autism. ""Establishing an association between autism and other psychiatric disorders might enable future investigators to better focus on genetic and environmental factors that might be shared among these disorders,"" Daniels said."
en.15.65.26.2008.5.5,Iran rules out halt to sensitive nuclear work,"Tehran, Mon May 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran ruled out halting its disputed nuclear work on Monday, saying it would not consider any incentives offered by world powers that violated the Islamic Republic's rights to atomic technology. Six world powers agreed at a meeting in London on Friday to offer a new incentives package to coax Iran to suspend uranium enrichment, a process which the West believes Tehran wants to master so that it can build nuclear weapons. Iran, the world's fourth largest oil producer, insists its nuclear program is aimed at generating electricity and says enrichment is a national right that it will not give up. ""Those incentives that violate the Iranian nation's right in any form will not be reviewed by the Islamic state,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told a news conference. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- the United States, France, Britain, China and Russia -- and Germany offered a package to Iran in 2006 that required Iran to halt enrichment. Tehran rejected it. ""Regarding the incentives package ... we believe the path adopted in the past should not be continued. They should act based on realities and international regulations. Talks should be held based on respecting nations' rights,"" Hosseini said. He said Iran had not formally received any new package. The incentives offered to Iran in 2006 included civil nuclear cooperation and wider trade in civil aircraft, energy, high technology and agriculture, if Tehran suspended enrichment and negotiated with the six powers. A European diplomat has said the heart of the previous offer -- helping Iran develop civil nuclear power -- remained. Britain said details would only be revealed to Iran's government. NO CHANGE IN POSITION Russia, which sent an envoy to Iran last week for discussions that covered the nuclear row, said on Saturday enrichment would have to be suspended during any talks. ""In the past, we have expressed our view about the issue that some Russian officials talked about. There has been no change in our position,"" Hosseini said when asked about the comments by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Russia along with China have both been reluctant to impose penalties on Iran but have, nevertheless, voted in the U.N. Security Council for three rounds of sanctions and demanded Tehran stop enrichment, which has civilian and military uses. Iran has also discussed with Russia its own package of proposals it says would open the way for talks to resolve the nuclear row and other issues. It has not disclosed details. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday Iran would not give up its rights despite Western pressure but he did not specifically mention nuclear work. ""Threatening the Iranian nation will not make it retreat,"" he told a rally. The United States, which has led efforts to isolate Iran, says it wants diplomacy to end the row but US officials have repeatedly said military action has not been ruled out. The Islamic Republic says Washington is too bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan to open a new front. Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Israeli television it would be tough to mount any attack on Iran. ""It would be a very significant challenge for the United States right now to get into a third conflict in that part of the world,"" Mullen told Israel's Channel Ten television. Jittery since Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in 2005 that the Jewish state to be ""wiped off the map"", Israeli officials have lobbied for a tougher global stand against Iran"
en.15.65.465.2008.5.1,China to be focus of U.S. attention in Asia: CIA,"Wed Apr 30, WASHINGTON (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - China is likely to achieve great-power status this century and maintain a military buildup but is not an inevitable enemy, CIA Director Michael Hayden said on Wednesday. China is an economic and strategic competitor with the United States, Hayden said in a Kansas speech on 21st-century trends, adding the country was likely to continue a ""troubling"" military buildup. ""China, a communist-led, nuclear state that aspires to -- and will likely achieve -- great power status during this century, will be the focus of U.S. attention (in Asia),"" he said. It all depends on whether China acts from a narrow self-interest or with broader perspective, Hayden said in a speech at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas. ""If Beijing begins to accept greater responsibility for the health of the international system -- as all global powers should -- we will remain on a constructive, even if competitive, path. If not, the rise of China begins to look more adversarial,"" Hayden said in his prepared remarks. Beijing is determined to show its strength ""after two centuries of perceived Western hegemony,"" he said. He said the military buildup was influenced by the U.S. show of armed might in the two Gulf wars and reinforced concerns about China's intentions toward Taiwan. ""But even without that issue, we assess that a buildup would continue."" China needs to access markets, technology and resources, and wants to assert its influence, but faces challenges including uneven income distribution, a growing dependence on imports of oil and other resources and environmental degradation. Hayden also outlined two other dominant global trends for the century -- a population boom in poor countries and resultant migration to the developed world, and a changing U.S. relationship with Europe marked by differences over how to fight terrorism. ""When there is a direct threat to their people or interests, European governments work with each other and their allies, including the United States, to disrupt it. But they tend not to view terrorism as we do -- as an overwhelming international challenge. Or if they do, we often differ on what would be effective and appropriate to counter it."""

Liverpool striker Fernando Torres and Portsmouth goalkeeper David James finished second and third respectively in the poll organised by the Football Writers Association since 1948. The 23-year-old Portuguese was the overwhelming winner, a week after being named the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year. Ronaldo, who has scored 38 goals this season, follows former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry as the only other man to win the award in successive seasons. Henry won the award in 2003 and 2004 and again in 2006. ""Ronaldo's award is no surprise after his brilliant form this season,"" FWA Chairman Paul Hetherington told Reuters. ""He did not exactly get 100 percent of the vote, but from the moment voting started he moved to the front and stayed there. ""To score 38 goals in a season -- so far -- is an astonishing feat for a player who is essentially a winger. Given his age, he has the potential and ability to dominate this award for years in an unprecedented way."" Stanley Matthews won the first Footballer of the Year award in 194"

The match starts in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, at 5:30pm Bangladesh standard time. Hosts Kyrgyzstan are rated top favourites in the meet after Laos pulled out of the race on Friday, and all focus are on the match between Bangladesh and the hosts. The two renew their rivalry on May 9 after the Nehru Cup last August in India where the Central Asian nation won convincingly 3-0. Despite that thrashing, newly appointed Bangladesh coach Abu Yusuf was confident about his team's chances. ""We have played before against Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan and their level is the same as ours,"" Yousuf was quoted as saying by the the-afc.com, the official website of the Asian Football Confederation. ""Sometimes you might not play good, might not understand your partners, but this time we understand each other well, and I hope with our good planning we can win,"" said former Bangladesh international. Bangladesh lost in the quarter-finals of the inaugural AFC Championship in Dhaka. With a FIFA ranking of as low as 196, Afghanistan are the least fancied of the three teams to make the cut but their German coach Klaus Staerk was optimistic of a decent show in the Kyrgyz capital. ""We have to show our best performance and everything will be fine,"" said the German who led the Afghans in the opening edition of the tournament in Dhaka where they finished at the bottom of their group with two draws. ""If we lose then it is still not a problem but we expect to perform to the best of our ability,"" Staerk was quoted by the the-afc.com as saying. Bangladesh has so far played two matches against Afghanistan and beat them 4-2 and drew 2-2 in the continental qualifiers in 1979, according to FIFA website. Besides, Bangladesh Under-23 side drew against their Afghan counterparts in the SAFF Games in Pakistan in 2003.

en.15.65.211.2008.5.3,Major powers agree new incentives offer to Iran,"London, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Major powers agreed on Friday to make a new offer of incentives to Iran to halt its sensitive nuclear work and a European diplomat said helping Tehran develop civil atomic power remained at the heart of the proposal. The offer, whose details have not been made public, is based on a package of economic and political benefits laid out by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany in June 2006 but so far spurned by Iran. ""I am glad to say that we have got agreement on an offer that will be made to the government of Iran,"" said British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, flanked by senior officials from China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States. ""We very much hope that they will recognize the seriousness and the sincerity with which we have approached this issue and that they will respond in a timely manner to the suggestions that we are making,"" he added. The United States and other Western nations suspect Iran of using its civil nuclear program as a cover to develop nuclear weapons. Iran says its nuclear program is to generate electricity so that it can export more of its oil and gas. The incentives offered to Iran in 2006 included civil nuclear cooperation and wider trade in civil aircraft, energy, high technology and agriculture, if Tehran suspended uranium enrichment and negotiated with the six. Uranium enrichment can be used to produce fuel for nuclear reactors or for atomic bombs. The 2006 proposal included recognition of Iran's right to develop civil nuclear energy, a promise to support the building of new, proliferation-resistant light water reactors and guarantees that Iran would have access to fuel. Russia has been the main country to promote the idea of refreshing the June 2006 offer while the United States has made no secret of its skepticism, with U.S. officials saying they saw little reason to expect Iran to change course. ""MORE ATTRACTIVE"" The European diplomat said the heart of the previous offer -- helping Iran develop civil nuclear power, including with state-of-the-art technology -- remained. ""The central part is maintained. It also contains a series of elements that can make the core more attractive,"" said the diplomat, who asked not to be named. ""It relates to economic issues,"" the diplomat added, declining to elaborate. Anthony Cordesman of Washington's CSIS think-tank said the civil nuclear offer could be made more financially attractive by selling fuel at lower rates, subsidizing the disposal of spent fuel rods, providing more advanced reactor designs or offering easier credit terms for the sale of reactors. But he doubted this would change Iran's mind. ""Iran is not proliferating as a hobby, it sees the development of missiles and nuclear weapons as a critical national interest,"" he said. The major powers have pursued a two-track approach towards Iran, offering economic and political benefits on the one hand and championing three U.N. Security Council resolutions that imposed sanctions against Iran on the other. ""We have always been clear that should be accompanied by an offer to Iran showing the benefits of engagement and cooperation with the international community and our meeting today has been dedicated towards taking the offer that we made in June 2006, reviewing it, and updating it,"" Miliband said. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said attacking Iran to prevent it from obtaining nuclear arms was not an option. ""We have to do everything we could to avoid finding ourselves faced with the only solution of bombing Iran,"" he told a news conference through an interpreter. ""The only option is to pressure the Iranian government through diplomatic means, economic means and financial means."" A senior U.S. official told reporters that the fine print of the new offer, which he described as ""updated,"" was still being worked out but was likely to be finalized within a week. He sought to play down expectations, saying: ""What we have been discussing really updates that (2006) package, is based on it, builds on it ... but it is hardly a brand new package."""

His remark came when a participant at a discussion on the relationship between Bangladesh and India drew his attention to the Farakka Barrage issue. ""Water availability is not the issue. Problem is lack of management,"" Chakravarty said at the discussion following a lecture by Indian author Nitish Sengupta on his book ""Bengal Divided: The Unmaking of a Nation"" in Gulshan. The participant said that the Farakka barrage had turned out to be a matter of life and death and that the issue had hit the relationship between the countries hard. Chakravarty said that those who blamed India for overflow of water in Bangladesh in the rainy season and drought in the summer were actually living in an unreal world. ""You have enough water. You can't manage it,"" he said. Sengupta, a former Indian bureaucrat and politician, said that cross-border communication and people to people contacts were important for strengthening relations between the countries. He stressed the need to turn the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) into a reality to enhance cooperation among the countries in the region. Recalling the history and culture of Bengal, he said that the peoples of Bangladesh and West Bengal have the same culture. ""Notwithstanding the highs and lows of India-Bangladesh relations, cultural unity and interaction between the two Bengals have remained steady,"" Sengupta said.

en.15.65.355.2008.5.2,U.S. airlines face worst crisis since 2001,"NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Major airlines that survived a decade of reorganization through bankruptcy are now facing their biggest test since the September 11, 2001 attacks. The latest signals from credit markets show default and bankruptcy risk is rising, even after four main carriers -- UAL's United Airlines, US Airways, Delta Air Lines Inc and Northwest Airlines Corp -- retooled themselves under Chapter 11 filings this decade. Those insolvencies already helped slash labor costs, and it will be tough to squeeze out more savings. That could mean a new round of airline bankruptcies may be afoot. Rising fuel prices, falling consumer demand and the prospect of a U.S. recession threaten to cripple the industry that was just starting to get on its feet before fuel prices soared to record levels, ravaging profits. U.S. jet fuel prices hit another record over $3.50 a gallon this week, tracking a rally in the cost of crude. Meanwhile, airline shares have plummeted 28 percent this year, hitting all-time lows. However, shares of most major airlines rose today as oil prices fell. ""This is the most perilous time for airlines since September 11,"" said Vicki Bryan, an airline analyst for Gimme Credit in Houston. ""United and USAirways are scrambling, and they could go bankrupt by the end of the year."" UAL lost $537 million in the first quarter and has about $2.9 billion of unrestricted cash in hand. Another near-term concern is the airlines' ability to comply with bank covenant and loan agreements. Northwest has asked lenders in its $1.2 billion bank loan to do away with fixed-charge coverage ratios in its loan agreement for the next 12 months, according to Reuters Loan Pricing Corp. United Airlines and American Airlines are at risk of breaching similar lending agreements, said Phil Baggaley, a Standard & Poor's analyst. ""A big near-term concern has been compliance with bank covenants,"" he said. Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for United, dismissed the prospect of bankruptcy and said the company has $2.9 billion in cash and $3 billion in unencumbered hard assets that it could use as collateral. ""The large losses posted by U.S. airlines this quarter, the forecast for further losses and the recent liquidations and bankruptcies of a number of carriers indicate quite clearly that the U.S. airline industry is in financial turmoil,"" US Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker said in a statement last month. A spokeswoman for US Airways also said the company is comfortable with its liquidity position. Fuel costs on average now make up a third of airline revenue, up from 25 percent a year ago. For some, such as AirTran, rising fuel costs are eating away at nearly half of its revenue, according to company filings. Airlines are pursuing alliances and mergers as one way to survive and grow. British Airways said on Wednesday it was in discussions with two of its largest U.S. rivals, American Airlines and Continental Airlines, which a source briefed on the matter said was about a potential alliance. Large carriers and low-cost carriers alike are feeling the pinch from higher fuel costs. A slew of smaller carriers including Eos Airlines, Frontier Airlines, Skybus Airlines and ATA Airlines declared bankruptcy in April. Those bankruptcies may be a warning sign, but so far are only ""drops in the ocean,"" said Roger King, an analyst with CreditSights, a New York-based research firm. ""Airlines are in a race to profitability, and no one's winning right now."" King doesn't foresee near-term bankruptcy threats to bigger airlines, but convertible bonds of UAL, parent of United Airlines, for example, are trading at distressed levels of 72 cents on the dollar, with sky-high yields of 19 percent. US Airways' convertible bonds now trade at about 85 cents to yield almost 15 percent. Moreover, the real stresses won't come until airlines find out what consumers will pay after demand dips. ""The real solution isn't consolidation, it's raising fares,"" King said. UAL's United and US Airways also are in advanced merger talks prompted by Continental Airlines Inc's decision this weekend to walk away from similar talks with UAL, sources with knowledge of the matter said. Delta Air Lines Inc also agreed to buy Northwest Airlines Corp in an all-stock deal in April. For investors, potential mergers and long-term trends mean value will be tough to find. ""Airlines have always been something you rent, you don't own,"" Bryan said. ""Short-term, when they are good, you can make some money, but you can lose a whole lot of money long-term and you're going to wear your breakfast for years."""

The figure brought to 5,151 the number of people infected by the virus in Anhui province, Xinhua quoted the provincial health administration as saying. Anhui's worst hit city was Fuyang with 362 cases. EV71 can cause hand, foot, and mouth disease, which is characterised by fever, sores in the mouth and a rash with blisters -- a common illness among infants and children but which is usually not fatal, according to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases. There is no vaccine or antiviral agent available to treat or prevent EV71. Enteroviruses spread mostly through contact with infected blisters or faeces and can cause high fever, paralysis and swelling of the brain."

The law requires general insurers to place 50 percent of their insurance with the state-owned general insurance company. But the settlement of claims is slowing because of what the industry leaders say is inordinate delay in payback by SBC. At a meeting with the adviser, the insurers also requested that publication of the amended insurance law be expedited. The meeting organised by the Bangladesh Insurance Association (BIA) on its premises in the financial district of Motijheel was meant to highlight the problems facing the industry. BIA president Rafiqul Islam said that both life and general insurance business had been growing fast and contributing substantially to the economy. The premium growth of the industry was almost 23 percent from 2005 to 2006. ""The problems needed to be addressed as soon as possible to maintain the momentum of growth of the insurance industry,"" he added. Islam identified what he called the SBC's unreasonable delay in settlement of claims and payment of cash loss as a major hindrance to business especially with the multinational companies in Bangladesh. More than 400 claims amounting to Tk 2,290 million have been piled up until June, 2006, Islam said. ""We think this is the reason that the multinationals are reluctant to do business with local insurers,"" he said. The BIA president added that multinationals insured only 1 percent of their holdings with local insurers. ""The rest of it goes abroad."" He said that the SBC felt shaky about settling claims in view of audit objection of commercial audit. ""They (SBC officials) know that audit would lead them to major difficulties. This situation would continue until the SBC management is taken over by professionals,"" he said. BIA also asked the government to revise its policies regarding corporate tax and assessment of income tax on insurers as well as income tax of agents. Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said that the present administration's major challenge was how to co-ordinate efficiently within the government towards a problem-solving approach. ""We, as the government, are in a process of learning continuously,"" Rahman added. The adviser said the insurance industry was an integral part of the economy. ""Insurance sector needs to be addressed seriously as Bangladesh is growing towards a mid-income state leading to expansion of business activities,"" he said. Responding to problems of the industry, Rahman said that the government would try its best to work for solving the problems the industry is facing. ""We are taking it as one of our top priorities, as this industry indicates growth of the country's economy,"" he said. The adviser also said that new clients were emerging for the industry and insurers needed to focus on that as well. ""As an example, I would cite the shrimp farmers of the coastal belt who saw all their businesses ruined when cyclone Sidr battered the zone,"" Rahman said. bdn"
en.15.65.307.2008.5.3,Carly Simon stays silent about who was so vain,"NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters/Nielsen/bdnews24.com) - Now that the identity of ""Deep Throat"", the secret source in the Watergate case, has been revealed, there is really only one lingering mystery from the 1970s. Who was songwriter Carly Simon singing about in her 1973 song ""You're So Vain""? ""I have told people,"" Simon, who has just released a new album ""This Kind of Love,"" said in an interview. She may have told a few friends, but millions of people still speculate about the person who ""walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht."" The man whose horse won at Saratoga, and who flew a Lear jet up to Nova Scotia to see the total eclipse of the sun. Simon's fans want to know if it was Mick Jagger, Warren Beatty, Cat Stevens, Kris Kristofferson, or perhaps another man she was close to. Simon, 62, said she has never been interviewed without being asked to identify the mystery person with the big ego. ""Everyone always asks me. I don't know why people are so interested,"" she said. ""Tell me, you must know."" She admits she uses a lot of specific incidents in the song. ""When I had the line 'You're so vain, you probably think this song is about you,' that was definitely about one person. The rest of the descriptions basically came from my relationship with that person."" Simon's song was a No. 1 hit at a time when America was embroiled with Watergate -- the political scandal following the break-in at Democratic Party headquarters that ultimately led to President Nixon's resignation. '70s MYSTERY MEN For three decades, people have argued about the identity of ""Deep Throat,"" whose insider guidance was vital to The Washington Post's coverage of Watergate. In a 2005 Vanity Fair magazine article, the family of Mark Felt, an FBI official, revealed he was the celebrated figure. So, isn't the guessing over ""You're So Vain"" a little like Deep Throat? ""Deep Throat was important; this is not important,"" Simon said in reply to the question. What is important for her now is the new album of Brazilian-influenced songs that she wrote. ""I'd been thinking Portuguese, because there are so many Portuguese people on Martha's Vineyard,"" she said of the island off Massachusetts where she spends much of her time. ""I wanted to get myself more into a samba mode of mind,"" she said of the album, which was produced by legendary songwriter Jimmy Webb. ""I fell in love with Brazilian music after seeing the movie 'Black Orpheus.'"" Later this year she will be touring Britain with her son Ben, whose father is singer James Taylor. In addition to her new album, Simon has been in the news thanks to the best-selling book ""Girls Like Us"" by Sheila Weller. It is about Simon and two other singer-songwriters, Joni Mitchell and Carole King. ""There are quotes about me and it's kind of like hearing what people said about you behind your back. So I shy away from that,"" she said about the book. ""I did read a little bit about me and some of it made me very sad,"" she said, explaining that it was painful to read about people who have left her lif"
en.15.65.457.2008.5.1,Rice returns to Mideast amid few signs of progress,"WASHINGTON, Thu May 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice this weekend makes her fourth visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories since the November Annapolis peace conference with little to show for the U.S. effort. Traveling ahead of President George W. Bush's May 13-18 trip to Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, Rice will see officials on both sides -- including in three-way sessions -- to assess a peace negotiation with no visible sign of progress. U.S. officials and analysts played down expectations for her trip, which begins in London for meetings on Friday to discuss reviving the Palestinian economy, reining in Iran's nuclear program and supporting newly independent Kosovo. She then travels to Jerusalem and the West Bank to meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and their top aides on Saturday and Sunday. ""It is all behind the scenes stuff. She is not going to say much in public. She really is trying to get the two sides to deal with, and make progress on, the core political issues,"" said a senior U.S. official who asked not to be named. Among other things, the official said Rice would gauge ""how active she needs to be in presenting her own ideas to each side in order to move the process forward."" The Bush administration has so far been loathe to float its own proposals to help the two sides bridge their differences, preferring to leave them to work these out directly. Martin Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel now at the Brookings Institution think tank, was skeptical that the Bush administration was on the verge of offering its own ideas on how to craft a peace agreement to end the six-decade conflict. ""I see no indication of that. I think that their very clear attitude to this -- at least the president's view of it -- is that it's up to the parties to make the deal,"" Indyk said. 'SOUR MOOD' He said bilateral talks about borders, Jewish settlements, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees could be making headway but that Abbas' dissatisfied air after meeting Bush in Washington last week suggested otherwise. ""Abu Mazen left here in a very sour mood -- and I think that is an indicator that things aren't going great,"" he said, referring to Abbas. Indyk also said he found it ""much more disturbing"" that there has been little movement on the ground, saying Israel has repeatedly moved to expand settlements since the Annapolis, Maryland, peace talks and done little to remove significant roadblocks on the West Bank. On the Palestinian side, it is unclear how much security forces under Abbas have been built up to take on militants. In London, Rice will attend a meeting of the quartet of Middle East peace mediators -- the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States -- and a gathering of Palestinian donors. She will also take part in a meeting of major powers -- Britain, China, France, Russia, the United States and Germany -- to discuss whether to improve a package of incentives offered to Iran in 2006 to suspend uranium enrichment. The U.N. Security Council has imposed three rounds of sanctions on Iran for defying council demands that it suspend its uranium enrichment program, which could be used to make fuel for power plants or atomic weapons. Iran has refused to buckle to the sanctions and has spurned previous offers of economic benefits to suspend its uranium enrichment, which it says is to make fuel for electrical power plants so it can export more of its valuable oil and gas. In June 2006, the six nations held out incentives to Iran, including civil nuclear cooperation and wider trade in civil aircraft, high technology and agriculture, if Tehran suspended uranium enrichment and negotiated with the six. Russia and China have argued for sweetening the incentives while the United States, which broke diplomatic relations with Iran after its 1979 Islamic revolution, has resisted. One Western diplomat said he thought it was unlikely that the so-called P5+1 ministers would reach an agreement on sweetening the incentives offer, saying ""I don't see any big breakthroughs here."" But another Western diplomat who asked not to be named said it depended on whether Russia and China -- which favor a much sweeter incentives package -- might be willing to accept a more modest improvement. ""This is really an exercise that is more, in our opinion, to stress again to the Iranian authorities and the Iranian public opinion, if possible, that there is this second part of the package that sometimes seems to have been forgotten,"" he said, referring to the incentives."
en.15.65.368.2008.5.3,US ponders Guantanamo closure as Bush term ends,"Washington, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bush administration could announce plans by the end of its term in January to close Guantanamo prison and an upcoming Supreme Court ruling might be the impetus for this, senior US officials and experts say. The government is under international and domestic pressure to close the prison camp, which opened at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba in January 2002 to house terrorism suspects caught after the invasion of Afghanistan. ""A decision could be made in this administration to announce the closure of Guantanamo,"" said a senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition he was not identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. ""It is unlikely in the next nine months that Guantanamo could be physically (closed) but it is possible the policy decision could be taken to close it."" Officials say planning and debate has intensified in recent months over how to deal with Guantanamo, which President George W. Bush acknowledges has tarnished America's image and human rights advocates say has damaged U.S. credibility. ""Everyone is agreed that we need to find a way that eventually leads to the closure of Guantanamo, which is the president's policy decision. It is a very complicated matter,"" said National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe. The Supreme Court is expected to rule within weeks whether Guantanamo prisoners have rights under the U.S. Constitution even though they are held on the base in Cuba, where the United States has had a presence for about 100 years. The court decision could influence whether the government announces plans to close the prison before Bush leaves office in January 2009, several officials said. ""If the Supreme Court concludes that the detainees have constitutional rights, then there would be little legal difference between holding them in Guantanamo or holding them on the (U.S.) mainland,"" one senior official said. ""It's possible the Supreme Court decision could provide an impetus to a policy decision to close Guantanamo."" 'LEGAL BLACK HOLE' Most of the 270 prisoners now at Guantanamo have been confined for years without charges. More than 500 prisoners have been released, including nine on Thursday. The government has said it intends to try 60 to 80 of those still in detention under war crimes tribunals. ""We would like to move towards the day when we can eventually close Guantanamo. We do not want to be the world's jailer,"" said Pentagon spokesman Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon. Matthew Waxman, a former senior Defense and State Department official who dealt with detainee policy, has argued strongly for the closure of Guantanamo but he said the Supreme Court's decision could ""cut both ways."" If inmates were seen to have the same rights in Guantanamo Bay as on the U.S. mainland, then there could be little strategic reason to move them. ""The major criticism of Guantanamo is that it represents a so-called legal black hole,"" said Waxman, now a professor at Columbia Law School in New York. Bush and other senior U.S. officials, including Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, have said they want Guantanamo Bay closed but they point to logistics and other problems. There is also a drive to announce the closure before Bush leaves office rather than have his successor claim credit. All of the candidates for November's presidential election -- Democratic Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and Republican Sen. John McCain -- have expressed a wish for Guantanamo to be closed. While the policy decision for the closure could be taken by this administration, it will be up to them to implement it. White House, Defense, Justice and State Department lawyers are still arguing the options, including the transfer of detainees to high security military prisons in the United States, moves that will be opposed by local politicians. The Justice Department is concerned that transferring the detainees to the United States would result in an onslaught of litigation from detainees who would try to use the U.S. justice system to seek their release. One option is the Disciplinary Barracks at the Fort Leavenworth Army base in Kansas, but the state's senior Republican senator, Sam Brownback, has made clear he will fight that. A naval facility in South Carolina is also being considered. Senior U.S. officials also hope countries reluctant so far to take home their own detainees will step forward once the U.S. government makes clear its intention to close the prison. ""Our allies talk a lot about concern of Guantanamo Bay but when they are asked to take their foreign nationals back, then they tend to stop talking,"" said Johndroe."
en.15.65.333.2008.5.5,Hundreds of thousands without shelter in Myanmar: UN,"Yangon, May 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people have been left without shelter and drinking water in military-ruled Myanmar after a devastating cyclone tore through the Irrawaddy delta, a United Nations official said on Monday. Aid agencies scrambled to deliver plastic sheeting, water and cooking equipment from stockpiles in the former Burma. The government says at least 351 died in the cyclone, which tore through the delta region on Saturday before devastating Yangon. That death toll is likely to climb as the authorities make contact with hard-hit islands and villages in the delta, the rice bowl of the impoverished Southeast Asian nation of 53 million. ""It's clear that this is a major disaster,"" Richard Horsey, of the United Nations disaster response office in Bangkok, told Reuters after an emergency aid meeting. ""How many people are affected? We know that it's in the six figures. We know that it's several hundred thousand needing shelter and clean drinking water, but how many hundred thousand we just don't know,"" he said. The International Federation of the Red Cross said teams were trying to assess the damage and aid requirements in the five declared disaster zones where some 24 million people live. ""We are issuing water purification tablets, clothing, plastic sheeting, cooking utensils and hygiene items. We're trying to mobilize portable water from local businesses,"" Michael Annear, head of Red Cross' Southeast Asia disaster management unit. ""We're preparing to send more stuff into the country. We have not been restricted,"" he said. A new policy imposed on foreign aid agencies in 2006 requires travel permits and official escorts for field trips. It also tightened rules on the transport of supplies and materials. ""That is the existing situation for international staff. The way most agencies work is they use national staff who have more freedom to move,"" Terje Skavdal, regional head of the U.N. office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), said. ""We will have a dialogue with the government to try to get access to the people affected."" It is not know whether Myanmar, the world's largest rice exporter when it won independence from Britain in 1948, will need to import emergency rice supplies. If it does, it is likely to inflate yet further the already sky-high prices of the staple. The World Food Programme says it has stocks of around 500,000 tonnes inside the country, but not near Yangon. CLEAN-UP BEGINS In the former capital, many roofs were ripped off even sturdy buildings, suggesting damage would be severe in the shanty towns that lie on the outskirts of the city of 5 million people. State television was still off the air in Yangon and clean water was becoming scarce. Most shops had sold out of candles and batteries and there was no word when power would be restored. In one western suburb, a group of 100 monks led efforts to clear streets littered with fallen trees and debris from battered buildings, a witness said. ""The clean-up is beginning but this will take a long time. The damage around town is intense,"" one Western diplomat told Reuters from Yangon, where the airport reopened on Monday. State media said 19 people had been killed in Yangon and 222 in the delta, where weather forecasters had predicted a storm surge of as much as 12 feet Only one in four buildings were left standing in Laputta and Kyaik Lat, two towns deep in the rice-producing region. Some 90,000 people were homeless on the island of Haingyi, around 200 km southwest of Yangon on the fringe of the delta. However, the carnage left by Nargis has not derailed a May 10 referendum on a new army-drafted constitution. ""The referendum is only a few days away and the people are eagerly looking forward to voting,"" the junta said in a statement confirming the vote would go ahead as planned. The charter is part of a ""roadmap to democracy"" meant to culminate in multiparty elections in 2010, but critics say it allows the army to retain an unacceptable degree of power. Bunkered down in their new capital, Naypyidaw, 240 miles to the north of Yangon, the junta's top brass has not formerly responded to an offer of international assistance. But Myanmar's Minister of Social Welfare told U.N. officials help may be welcomed, depending on the terms, Skavdal said. ""I think it's a positive sign. As long as we are in dialogue it is good,"" he said. Shunned by the West for its detention of democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi and dismal human rights record, Myanmar has been the target of Western sanctions for years. It receives far less foreign aid -- about $2.50 per capita -- than regional neighbors Cambodia ($47) and Laos ($63) and below the $14 average for low-income nations."
en.15.65.299.2008.5.6,Commodities lag for no link with world quality control firms,"Dhaka, May 6 (bdneww24.com)Bangladeshi commodities are lagging in the international market as Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution is not a member of international quality control organisations such as OIML, CIPM and MRA, an official said Tuesday. BSTI director (metrology) Lutfur Rabbi made the disclosure at a meeting of BSTI officials with the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of the industry ministry Mahbub Jamil Tuesday. The International Organisation of Legal Metrology (OIML), International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM and Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) work to maintain the quality of international commodities. Rabbi said: ""As BSTI is not a member of these organisations, Bangladeshi commodities are lagging in the international market."" ""The international buyers, while buying commodities of any country, visit the websites of these three organisations and collect information on quality control in the related country. No quality control information of a country, not their member, is available."" Rabbi told bdnews24.com: ""The weight of a commodity is very import to the buyer. For example, the quality control certificate of a reliable organisation is necessary about the contents and quantity of chemicals in a medicine. In case of buying a commodity from any country, not their member, the buyer becomes suspicious."" The official said: ""BSTI is now a corresponding member of OIML. But about two to three years ago, it was a full member. We failed to pay annual fees of 1,000 euros. As a result we were relegated. For CIPM and MRA, the annual fee is $1,000."" He said that before giving membership, the organisations meticulously scrutinise the quality control system of a country. As BSTI was a member of OIML earlier, it could now become a member again. But to become a member of CIPM and MRA Bangladesh will have to wait until next year. Because some new equipment is being installed, and has to be put in operation."" He requested the special assistant to take an initiative for membership of these important organisations. Mahbub Jamil assured the BSTI officials of informing the industry ministry in this regard. ""Industrialisation has to be carried forward for achieving MDGs. You will have to think how BSTI can play a role in this regard. It must be ensured that quality products are marketed,"" he said. Stressing taking forward the development process by coordinating the public and private sectors, Jamil said: ""The two sides should not eye each other with suspicion. If there are no business firms, the country's economy will collapse."" He urged businessmen to shun the ""mentality of making excessive profit"" and do business upholding morality. BSTI director general Md Azmal Hossain and other high officials were present. Earlier, the special assistant visited different laboratories of BSTI. The number of member countries of OIML is 59 including India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the UK and the USA. The number of corresponding members is 57. bdnew"
en.15.65.119.2008.5.5,China may be KFC's salvation as US faces recession,"SHANGHAI, May 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With a possible US recession looming, Colonel Sanders is turning to China to fill the breach, offering a menu of fried dough and preserved egg porridge alongside the chicken that turned KFC into an American icon. Beset by falling sales at home, Yum! Brands Inc, owner of the Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut brands, is mounting an expansion drive in China that could make the country its biggest source of profit within a decade. But like many foreign firms in China, from mobile phone makers to clothing designers, the US fast food giant has discovered it can't rely on a foreign brand name for growth and must instead adapt to local tastes and lifestyles. So KFC has given a Chinese twist to its menu by adding dishes similar to the food that tens of millions of Chinese grab from street stalls or hole-in-the-wall restaurants on their way to work every day. ""We felt that we could not just copy a model in a foreign country,"" Sam Su, the Taiwan-born, US-educated head of Yum's China division, told a forum in Shanghai late last year. ""In a market like China, everyone should try to create new models."" The formula is apparently working. Yum's sales in China grew 12 percent in the first quarter compared with 5 percent in other international destinations and 3 percent in the United States. Yum's KFC was the first foreign fast food company to move into China, opening its first outlet in 1987. Since then, Yum has become China's biggest restaurant chain with some $2 billion of annual sales and over 2,500 KFC and Pizza Hut stores. That dwarfs the roughly 900 outlets of McDonald's Corp, its nearest rival in China's $28 billion fast food market. And the drawcard isn't necessarily Colonel Sanders secret recipe of herbs and spices. Chinese customers are often not even interested in fried chicken. He Qi, a 35-year-old employee at a Shanghai advertising agency, says she visits KFC three or four times a week to eat fish, porridge and egg tarts. ""I avoid touching fried stuff because it's bad for one's health,"" she says. EXPANSION PLAN Yum intends to increase its lead and plans to add 425 restaurants in China this year. McDonald's has said it aims to open at least 125 stores in the country during 2008. David Novak, chief executive officer of Yum, has said he envisages eventually having over 20,000 restaurants in China. ""We're in the first inning of a nine-inning ball game in China,"" Novak told investors in a conference call in February. So far, investors are welcoming the China strategy. Operating profit at Yum's China division surged 30 percent to $375 million last year, accounting for over a quarter of the firm's total operating profit of $1.36 billion, which rose 8 percent. Novak has predicted China's contribution could reach 40 percent by 2017, exceeding 30 percent for the United States at that time. Despite sliding U.S. revenues, which dropped 7 percent last year, Yum's shares are up about 29 percent since the start of 2007, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat. The portly, white-haired figure of Colonel Sanders helped draw Chinese to KFC restaurants in the late 1980s, when China was opening up to the world and customers were eager to experience Western lifestyles for the first time. But in the last few years, Yum has increasingly designed products and services specifically for local consumers. This strategy has had problems as well as opportunities. ""It's a lot more difficult to standardise Chinese food. It's much easier with hamburgers,"" said Shaun Rein, managing director of the China Market Research Group, adding that another problem was finding the right managers to run all the outlets. This year Yum plans a nationwide launch of its breakfast services, now available at about half of KFC stores, and will test 24-hour KFC restaurants and expand home delivery services to target the huge nocturnal populations of China's crowded cities. It will also add 85 Pizza Hut restaurants and expand the chain's home delivery service. Yum's China manager, Su, has successfully transformed Pizza Hut, a business that was languishing in China, into an upscale restaurant chain targeting China's 250 million middle-class consumers. ""Pizza Hut is the cheapest of the cheapest restaurants in the United States, but in China, Pizza Hut is seen as a classy, up-scale place for dining,"" Rein said. ""Yum has reinvented the Pizza Hut brand in China ... They know who's spending the money."" RISKS Nevertheless there are risks associated with Yum's rapid expansion in China such as over-exposure, analysts say. ""If there are too many KFCs in the street, people would feel sick of it. There may be a backlash; The same store sales will go down. Margins would be hit,"" Rein added. Based on Yum's track record so far though, analysts believe it will be able to navigate successfully through the complicated fast food scene in China. ""Yum has the right boss in China,"" said Lucy Wu, deputy head of China's Chan Store and Franchise Association. ""Su is Chinese and knows the Chinese market much better than foreigners. His localisation strategy is the secret of success."" Instead of copying the KFC model in the United States, Su, 55, spent the past two decades re-defining fast-food, which is often associated with unhealthy, junk food in the west. ""Yum has localised its menu a lot in China, much more than McDonald's did,"" said Rein of China Market Research Group. Yum's China business is so successful that Chief Executive Novak is now copying the China model to the United States by introducing healthier products in its US outlets, increasing emphasis on breakfast and evening sales and broader menus that include more desserts and beverages. ""Let's learn from our most successful business. Let's learn from our China Business,"" Novak told investors at Yum's annual shareholder conference in New York in December. Su's next goal is to push ahead with a traditional Chinese fast-food chain called East Dawning to head off competition from local players such as Kungfu Catering Management Co and ""hotpot"" chain Inner Mongolia Little Sheep. Yum has operated 10 East Dawning branches in Shanghai since 2005, and it plans to test Beijing's market in time for the Olympics. East Dawning, named after a phrase in a Song dynasty poem, serves traditional Chinese dishes such as tomato beef noodles, beef rice and bean curd. ""Yum has a huge first-mover advantage in China,"" says Wu. ""Smaller rivals are not likely to threaten Yum's leadership position in the foreseeable future."
en.15.65.87.2008.5.1,Japan evacuates hundreds after latest gas suicide,"TOKYO, Thu May 1, (bdnewsa24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes in northern Japan on Thursday over fears about hydrogen sulphide gas produced by a man who used it to commit suicide, the latest in a series of such cases. A family member called emergency services after finding a 24-year-old man collapsed at his home in the city of Otaru in the northern island of Hokkaido in the early hours of the morning, local police said. He taken to hospital but later declared dead. The man's 58-year-old mother was also taken to hospital suffering from the effects of the gas, the police spokesman said. Television showed about 350 people being evacuated in the dark from their homes in the area to the grounds of a local primary school. They were allowed to return home later. Suicides by hydrogen sulphide, which can be made from household detergent, are a growing problem in Japan. At least 40 cases have been reported this year, public broadcaster NHK said last month, citing the Japan Suicide Prevention Association. Japan has the second-highest suicide rate in the Group of Eight nations after Russia, according to the World Health Organisation. The annual number of suicides has been above 30,000 for nine years in a row, police figures showed last year. The National Police Agency this week urged Internet service providers to delete information from websites about how to make hydrogen sulphide, which is touted as ""an easy way to die"". ""There are many cases of suicide and they often harm people living nearby,"" the police agency said in a letter to a number of groups representing Internet providers. In a separate case, a 49-year-old man was arrested in Fukushima, north of Tokyo, on Thursday after admitting trying to kill his bedridden 82-year-old mother with hydrogen sulphide, Kyodo news agency said. The man's father returned from working in the fields on Wednesday to find him mixing toilet cleanser and other substances in a bucket by his mother's bedside, the agency said. No gas was actually emitted, it said."
en.15.65.10.2008.5.7,Greed behind food price rises: development bank head,"Brussels, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The food price crisis is caused largely by greed and speculation rather than food shortages, the head of Southern Africa's development bank said on Tuesday. Spiraling food costs -- called a ""silent tsunami"" by the World Food Program -- have ignited fury and a rash of protests from Haiti to Somalia to Bangladesh. Exporting countries have curbed shipments to ensure domestic supplies and tame inflation. ""These increases in food prices are not the consequence of food shortages, it's the consequence of human greed that is putting at risk the lives of millions of men, women and children,"" Jay Naidoo told Reuters. ""There are companies that are making super profits on this issue."" The root causes of the more than 40 percent rise in food prices in the last year are disputed. Experts point to strong demand from Asian emerging markets, adverse weather in some producer countries and increased use of biofuels. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said it would give up to $500 million in emergency loans to regional economies hardest hit by the crisis and double investment in the farm sector to $2 billion in 2009. After four days of talks in Madrid, governments remained split on whether they should use export bans and market intervention to ensure 1 billion poor Asians living on less than $2 a day do not slip back into hunger and malnutrition. ""Trade measures or price controls are not efficient ways to combat the food crisis or food price inflation. It distorts the market and could exacerbate the situation in the international grain market,"" ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda told Reuters. ""... the best way to address the immediate difficulty is to strengthen social safety nets through targeted support for the poor rather than generalized food subsidies or trade measures or price controls."" Naidoo, of the Development Bank of Southern Africa, said on the sidelines of a conference on malnutrition in Brussels that governments and world bodies should take concerted action to control surging food prices. RICE DOWN Thai rice prices fell around 10 percent on Tuesday after importers taking their cue from Manila's decision to scrap a large tender held back on purchases. Five Thai exporters quoted prices for 100 percent B trade white rice, the world's benchmark, at between $900 and $920 a tonne, free on board. That is down from last week's $990-$998 a tonne. Calming nerves further, Thailand, the world's biggest rice exporter, backed off its proposal for an ""OPEC-style"" rice cartel. ""If Thailand was going to set up a rice cartel to fix the price, that would worsen food security,"" Foreign Minister Noppadon Pattama told reporters. On Monday, the Philippines, the world's top rice importer, scrapped its largest rice tender of the year. Vietnam, the world's second-largest rice exporter, said it was considering imposing a duty on rice exports because it wants to save more of the grain for domestic consumption. In Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo cut import taxes on staples including ""rice, maize, wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oil, powdered milk, cement, mackerel, chicken, beef ... and equipment necessary for production,"" according to a government statement published on Tuesday. Traders said the fall in prices could be limited if Myanmar, which has committed rice exports to neighboring countries, decides to halt overseas sales and instead starts to import the grain after being hit by a devastating cyclone. Some of Myanmar's rice customers are expected to turn to Thailand for supplies after the military-ruled country was lashed by Cyclone Nagris. The storm killed up to 22,500 people and ripped through Myanmar's Irrawaddy delta, its main rice growing area once dubbed the ""rice bowl of Asia""."
en.15.65.306.2008.5.5,Aid agencies struggle with Myanmar cyclone damage,"Yangon, May 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's military authorities and foreign aid workers struggled on Monday to assess the damage from a devastating cyclone that killed more than 350 people and left tens of thousands homeless. State media said 20,000 homes were destroyed on one island alone after Cyclone Nargis, a Category 3 storm packing winds of 190 km (120 mile) per hour, ripped through Myanmar's Irrawaddy delta on Saturday. The death toll is likely to climb as the authorities slowly make contact with islands and villages in the delta, the rice bowl of the former Burma. ""The government is having as much trouble as anyone else in getting a full overview. Roads are not accessible and many small villages were hit and will take time to reach,"" Terje Skavdal, regional head of the U.N. office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), told Reuters in Bangkok. The movements of foreign aid workers are restricted by the military, which has ruled the former Burma for 46 years and is largely spurned by the international community due to its repressive policies. A new policy imposed on foreign aid agencies in 2006 requires travel permits and official escorts for field trips. It also tightened rules on the transport of supplies and materials. ""That is the existing situation for international staff. The way most agencies work is they use national staff who have more freedom to move,"" Skavdal said ""We will have a dialogue with the government to try to get access to the people affected."" The regime named Prime Minister Thein Sein to lead its relief effort in five declared disaster zones. However, the carnage left by Nargis has not derailed a May 10 referendum on a new army-drafted constitution. ""The referendum is only a few days away and the people are eagerly looking forward to voting,"" the junta said in a statement confirming the vote would go ahead as planned. The charter is part of a ""roadmap to democracy"" meant to culminate in multiparty elections in 2010, but critics say it allows the army to retain an unacceptable degree of power. CLEAN-UP BEGINS In Yangon, many roofs were ripped off even sturdy buildings, suggesting damage would be severe in the shanty towns that lie on the outskirts of the city of 5 million people. State television was still off the air in Yangon and clean water was becoming scarce. Most shops had sold out of candles and batteries and there was no word when power would be restored. In one western suburb, a group of 100 monks led efforts to clear streets littered with fallen trees and debris from battered buildings, a witness said. ""The clean-up is beginning but this will take a long time. The damage around town is intense,"" one Western diplomat told Reuters from Yangon, where the airport reopened on Monday. State media said 19 people had been killed in Yangon and 222 in the delta, where weather forecasters had predicted a storm surge of as much as 12 feet (3.5 metres) Only one in four buildings were left standing in Laputta and Kyaik Lat, two towns deep in the rice-producing region. Some 90,000 people were homeless on the island of Haingyi, around 200 km southwest of Yangon on the fringe of the delta. United Nations disaster experts were meeting in Bangkok, the capital of neighbouring Thailand, to assess the prospects for an international relief effort. With many buildings damaged or destroyed, plastic sheeting was a top priority to provide shelter during the rainy season. Water purification tablets, mosquito nets and cooking equipment was needed too, Skavdal said, as well as some food aid. Bunkered down in Naypyidaw, 240 miles to the north of Yangon, the junta's top brass has not formerly responded to an offer of international assistance. But Myanmar's Minister of Social Welfare told U.N. officials help may be welcomed, depending on the terms, Skavdal said. ""I think it's a positive sign. As long as we are in dialogue it is good,"" he said. Shunned by the West for its detention of democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi and dismal human rights record, Myanmar has been the target of Western sanctions for years. It receives far less foreign aid -- about $2.50 per capita -- than regional neighbours Cambodia ($47) and Laos ($63) and below the $14 average for low-income nations. In Thailand, Nargis had weakened as it moved into western and northern parts of the country on Monday, where there were no reports of damage or casualties."

The riot at the National Penitentiary north of the capital began late on Friday and was the second such incident in the country's overcrowded prison system in a week. ""The inmates were killed with knives and machetes ... . They were all covered in blood and there are several beheaded bodies,"" spokesman Hector Ivan Mejia told Reuters. Last Saturday nine prisoners were killed in a riot at another prison in the northern city of San Pedro Sula. The Central American country's 25 prisons are overflowing with some 12,000 inmates. Fights are frequent as members of street gangs, known as maras, vie for control inside the penitentiaries. The streets of Honduras' main cities are blighted by maras, who often are involved in drug and weapons trafficking."
en.15.65.205.2008.5.7,"In food price crunch, more Americans seek help","Baltimore, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Carolyn Stanley, a single mother with five children, receives $327 in food stamps each month to feed her family. With prices for staples like bread and cheese going ever higher, each month is harder than the last. She buys hot dogs over higher-quality meat and feeds her kids cereal, but even with other government support she often has to seek help from local churches and from friends. ""The food runs out somewhere within the middle of the month, or getting close to the end,"" said Stanley, 49. ""It is not easy. I pray."" While food inflation is causing tensions and riots around the world, even the affluent United States is being touched. Stories such as Stanley's are becoming more common as Americans increasingly turn to food stamps and other programs to make ends meet. At a cost of about $39 billion to the U.S. Treasury, nearly one in 10 Americans -- 28 million people -- are expected next year to use food stamps, which would be the highest enrolment in the program apart from a spike after the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005. U.S. food prices are expected to rise by up to 5 percent this year, part of a global trend driven fueled by consumption in rapidly developing countries such as China, adverse weather, and the funneling of food crops to make biofuels. ""People don't want to talk about hunger in America because that's not supposed to have happened. Didn't we take care of that a generation or two ago?"" said Kevin McGuire, Food Stamp director for Maryland. ""Well, not really."" The number of beneficiaries jumped 12 percent in Maryland from a year ago. MAKING ENDS MEET The crunch comes as the economy takes a sharp turn for the worse and many see the number of people receiving food stamps as advance indicator of an economic slump. Today, food stamp officials are not only watching more people apply for the benefits, they're seeing more of them come from the working poor, people whose low-wage jobs still leave them eligible under the program's strict income caps. ""Having a job isn't enough anymore. Having two or three jobs isn't enough anymore,"" said Marcia Paulson, spokeswoman for Great Plains Food Bank in North Dakota, where nearly half the households on food stamps have at least one adult with a job. ""Our pantries are overwhelmed,"" said Diane Doherty, director of the Illinois Hunger Coalition, which helps the needy find food assistance and sign up for food stamps. Doherty said people's food stamps are running out more quickly due to higher prices -- often within two weeks. More than ever are receiving stamps for the first time, she said. ""They're just not able to make ends meet when they're trying to raise a family on these meager salaries, with the cost of housing and now with the cost of gas,"" she said. Maryland's McGuire is one official who believes that the annual adjustments in food stamp dollars have been inadequate. Nationally, the average benefit per person early this year was about $100 per month -- around $1 a meal. The government will adjust that payout in June, but people won't see their benefits change until October. Stanley, who receives no child support for her daughters, the youngest of whom is in the first grade, hopes that federal officials will act more quickly. ""If you've ever lived the crunch of that poverty level, you would understand that people need more,"" Stanley said. OUTREACH PARTLY BEHIND GROWING ROLLS Program officials are quick to stress that food stamps were never intended to make up a family's entire food budget, and point to other programs that can help needy families -- school lunches, after-school programs, and food banks. ""We firmly believe that no American should go hungry,"" said Kate Houston, a deputy undersecretary at USDA. The growing rolls of food stamp beneficiaries is a mixed picture, Houston said, reflecting in part a success in reaching out to eligible people who hadn't received help in the past. ""The program is designed to expand and contract based on economic conditions,"" she said. House and Senate lawmakers, forging a final compromise on a giant agriculture law, now plan to add over $10 billion to the food stamp program over the next decade, raising the standard income deduction, boosting the minimum benefit to $14 a month, an increase of $4, and giving more to food pantry donations. Food stamp officials are counseling people on how to make their stamps last as long as possible -- buying ground beef or other meat when it's on sale and freezing it, for example. That may be cold comfort for people like Sandra Fowler, 42, a mother in suburban Chicago who recently applied for food stamps, and describes her situation as increasingly desperate. Fowler is months behind on mortgage payments on her house and is going through a messy divorce. ""It will feed my children, at least. I've been going to a food pantry, waiting in line. The choices are really limited -- there might be some eggs, canned goods,"" she said. Most experts predict that high crop and fuel prices will linger for at least two to three years, and sky-high oil and gasoline prices are unlikely to abate any time soon. Even in the country known as the 'land of plenty,' McGuire said, the cost crunch ""affects literally at a gut level what's going on"" for the less fortunate. ""We're going to need to start stitching the safety net a little bit bigger."""
en.15.65.178.2008.5.6,"US Gasoline price at new record, diesel falls: EIA","WASHINGTON, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US average retail price for gasoline rose a penny over the last week to a new high of $3.61 a gallon, while the price of diesel fuel fell, the federal Energy Information Administration said on Monday. The national price for regular, self-service gasoline is up 56 cents from a year ago because of expensive crude oil prices. US crude on Monday hit a record $120.36 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price of crude oil accounts for about 72 percent of the cost for making gasoline. The White House said President George W Bush would discuss with Saudi Arabian officials during his visit to the kingdom this month how high oil prices were hurting the US economy. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, along with other OPEC members, has turned down US requests to ramp up production, saying markets are well-supplied. OPEC blames a weak US dollar and speculation for high crude prices. The EIA's latest weekly survey of service stations showed gasoline was the most expensive on the West Coast at $3.80 a gallon, up 1.4 cents. San Francisco had the highest city price at $3.93, up 1.5 cents. The Rocky Mountain states had the lowest regional price at $3.49 a gallon, up 1.6 cents. Denver had the cheapest pump price, down 0.7 cent, at $3.47. Consumers of diesel fuel saw a week-to-week decline in prices, down 2.8 cents from the previous week to $4.15 a gallon, the EIA said. Still, diesel remained up $1.36 from a year earlier. The central Atlantic states had the most expensive diesel at $4.35 a gallon, down 3.1 cents. The Gulf Coast region had the cheapest fuel at $4.08, down 2.9 cents, the agency said. The EIA is expected to revise up its estimate for the peak prices for diesel and gasoline this summer, when the agency releases its new short-term energy forecast on Tuesday"

The former football superstar, who was elected president Monday, took over from outgoing president SA Sultan, and met the press before sitting with the members of the 21-member executive committee for the first time. ""We will love to see football in the field instead of on the table, and I promise you we will try to bring the previous glory back,"" Salahuddin told a full-house press conference at the BFF House. ""We will also try to transfer the excitement and enthusiasm we saw in the election onto the playground,"" the former national striker said, ""Money is not a matter in developing football, and they will provide money anyhow."" Salahuddin wanted 7 to 10 days to let the nation know his plans as he realised that the sports arena, including each player and organiser, was looking at him to resurrect the near-dead football. The footballer-turned-organiser said that he felt ""no pressure and has taken his responsibility as a challenge."" Salahuddin also said that he wanted to look forward rather than remember matters that had earlier happened. The 58-year old superstar said that there was no deviation in the committee though they were contesting the election from two separate panels and that he had already met with the newly elected members. Former striker Salam Murshidi, elected senior vice president from Salahuddin's rival panel, said that the deviation ended following the elections as it was a part of democracy to contest splitting into two groups. He said that they would work as a unit in future, and would implement all projects as directed by the BFF president. Salahuddin also hoped that the unity among the members would remain unbroken at the end of the four-year stint. Outgoing president SA Sultan urged the new committee to learn from the mistakes the previous committee made. Newly elected vice presidents Manzoor Hossain Malu, Badal Roy, Shawkat Ali Khan Jahangir, Kazi Nabil and members Harun-or-Rashid, Anwarul Haq Helal, Sirajul Islam Bachchu, Sheikh Mohammad Aslam, Shafiquzzaman, Hasanuzzaman Bablu, Khurshid Babul, Golam Rabbani Helal, Fazlur Rahman Babul, Satyajit Das Rupu, Amirul Islam Babu, Asfaruzzaman Suhrab and Mahbubur Rahman Shahin were also present. b"

But what's a girl to do when she gets dumped or divorced and those rings, necklaces and love gifts lose their emotional sparkle? Help is just a click away on new Web sites that provide an outlet for selling jewelry from past relationships, sharing break-up stories and helping broken hearts heal. ""You go through a divorce. What do you do with that ring? Maybe you have a child you can pass it on to. Maybe you don't. It just sits there,"" said Marie Perry, who with her stepdaughter Megahn Perry runs www.exboyfriendjewelry.com. ""We wanted to create a platform in the community where people can get in contact with others with similar needs,"" Perry told Reuters. Three months after its launch with the slogan ""You Don't Want It. He Can't Have It Back,"" the Web site has 3,000 registered users and more than 600 postings of rings, bracelets and earrings for sale -- all with a personal tale attached. ""Studs from a Dud,"" rites one woman, selling a pair of cubic zirconia earrings given to her three years ago. Six months later, she says, the boyfriend dumped her over the phone -- while she was recovering from brain surgery. ""Oops,"" writes another, selling a white gold wedding band. ""Hey, Mom and Dad, remember that time I got married really young? Sorry about that. I can't pay you back for the wedding, but I'll split whatever I get for these with you. Deal?"" ""We wanted to keep the tone fun and tongue in cheek. There are some bitter women but most stories are really light-hearted although a few are about people who have been in an abusive situation. But now they are ready to move on,"" said Perry. The idea was born when Megahn Perry, a Los Angeles actress and writer, was looking for a safe, reliable place to sell a wedding set after an amicable divorce and realized others might have boyfriend jewelry languishing in drawers or with attendant memories that make them too painful to wear. The local pawn shop proved an unattractive option, and Ebay felt too anonymous. So she teamed up with her stepmother Marie, researched the market and found a gap in it. New Orleans students, Allison Wasserman and Elizabeth Rothbeind, set up a similar venture, www.Ex-cessories.com, in April after a teary afternoon sorting out photographs, jewelry and other mementos of an ex-boyfriend. With the motto ""Don't Get Mad - Break Even,"" it offers independent appraisals of jewelry, matches buyers with sellers, and provides a social network. Although aimed at women, the Web sites welcome men. ""Some men thought it was going to be another male-bashing site but that's not what we're trying to do,"" said Perry. But she admits the ""He Can't Have It Back"" slogan has rankled some who believe jewelry should be returned to the giver. ""Etiquette says that if the engagement is broken off, you should absolutely give the ring back. But sometimes the man says no, and sometimes it depends on circumstances,"" she said. As one woman posting a diamond ring for $3,500 wrote: ""Beautiful ring came with the wrong man. Decided to sell to regain the money that I spent finishing payments on the ring that my ex didn't."""

Cyclone Nargis, which was packing 190 km (120 miles) per hour winds when it hit on Saturday, left the streets of the former Burma's main city littered with debris from fallen trees and battered buildings. Many roofs had been ripped off even sturdy buildings, suggesting damage would be severe in the shanty towns that sit on the outskirts of the sprawling river delta city of 5 million people. ""I have never seen anything like it,"" one retired government worker told Reuters. ""It reminded me of when Hurricane Katrina hit the United States."" Although the sun was shining by Sunday morning, the former capital was without power and water. An Electricity Board official said it was impossible to know when services -- hit-and-miss at the best of times in one of Asia's poorest countries -- would be restored. ""It is very hard to say when we can resume supply. We still have to clear the mess,"" the official, who did not want to be named, said. In some towns in the Irrawaddy delta, where the massive cyclone landed on Friday night having gathered steam in the tropical waters of the Bay of Bengal, more than half of buildings had been damaged or collapsed, official newspapers said. The death toll -- so far just four people in Yangon -- is expected to climb as authorities slowly make contact with outlying towns and villages along the coast, where weather forecasters had predicted a storm surge of up to 12 feet (3.5 m). Official media said four vessels sank in Yangon harbor. It remains to be seen what impact the storm will have on a referendum on an army-drafted constitution scheduled for May 10. The charter is part of a ""roadmap to democracy"" meant to culminate in multiparty elections in 2010 and end nearly five decades of military rule. Critics say it gives the army too much control. Naypyidaw, the generals' new capital, is 240 miles north of Yangon. An official at Yangon International Airport said all incoming flights had been diverted to the second city of Mandalay, in the middle of the southeast Asian nation, and all departures from Yangon had been cancelled. Thai Airways in Bangkok said they would decide at 0700 GMT whether to resume flights. Nargis is now moving northeast into northern Thailand, where it has already caused heavy rain and triggered storm warnings."

""Whenever the president has discussions with leaders in the region he talks about the impact that high oil prices do have on our economy and the impact that that has on the world economy. So, I think you can expect the president to make those concerns very clear,"" White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said. Saudi Arabia, a key member of OPEC, is the world's largest oil producer and has the most unused oil output capacity. However, the kingdom and other OPEC members have rejected U.S. calls for the group to ramp up production to help lower prices, saying the markets are well supplied with crude. The price of U.S. crude oil hit a record $120.21 a barrel on Monday at the New York Mercantile Exchange. The higher oil price will likely be passed on to consumers at the pump, as crude accounts for about 72 percent of the cost of making gasoline.

en.15.65.33.2008.5.4,How do baby birdies learn to sing? By babbling,"WASHINGTON, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Baby birds babble much like human infants do, and they have their own special brain circuits to do it, researchers reported on Thursday. Their findings suggest that learning to sing -- and also to speak -- is a process independent of adult singing or speech. Perhaps other aspects of infant learning are equally independent in the brain, Michale Fee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and colleagues suggested. ""Young birds learn their songs in a series of stages. They start out just as humans do, by babbling,"" Fee said in an audio interview on the Web site of the journal Science, which published the findings. ""The brain really learns how to use its body by making spontaneous movements and seeing what happens,"" Fee added. ""Babbling in songbirds is just an example of play -- it's vocal play."" Fee's team has been studying zebra finches, using a system that allows them to record the firing of individual neurons in the birds' brains. They were selectively inactivating brain cells in an area called the high vocal center or HVC. ""Scientists have been inactivating this area, the HVC, for a long time to try and figure out what it does,"" Fee said. They found by accident that when the HVC was inactivated, an adult bird started babbling like a juvenile. Adults finches, he said, produce a precise, stereotyped pattern of sound. ""Every time he sings his song, he repeats that motif over and over again,"" Fee said. In contrast, baby birds babble randomly. The HVC acts like a clock to produce this precision. What Fee's team learned was that the baby birds use a very different circuit when they babble. Scientists had thought that learning to sing produced a gradual maturing of one circuit in the brain. This finding contradicts such common wisdom, and may apply to other forms of learning among baby creatures. ""I think our experiments are really the first to look at this question of where the brain circuits are that generate early vocalization in young animals,"" Fee said. Other researchers have shown that when birds sing, they use areas of the brain analogous to those used in human speech. Researchers have also shown that birds not only dream, but they dream about singing."
en.15.65.239.2008.5.2,Obama fights perception he is elitist,"Fort Wayne, May 02, Indiana (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama sought to convince Americans he is not elitist on Thursday as new polls showed his aura of inevitability has declined after weeks of negative headlines. In an interview on NBC's ""Today Show,"" Obama said both his rivals, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican John McCain, come from more privileged backgrounds than he did. ""The irony is, I think it is fair to say that both Michelle and I grew up in much less privileged circumstances than either of my two potential opponents,"" said Obama. A flap over racially charged rhetoric from his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, and Obama's comments that small-town Americans ""cling"" to guns and religion, appears to have taken a toll on the Illinois senator as he fights for the right to face McCain in the November election. A New York Times/CBS News poll found that 51 percent of Democratic primary voters say they expect Obama to win their party's nomination battle against New York Sen. Clinton, down from 69 percent a month ago. The poll said 48 percent of Democrats say he is the candidate with the best chance of defeating Arizona Sen. McCain, down from 56 percent a month ago. Similarly, a Pew Research Center poll found a tighter national race between Obama and Clinton, with him holding a 47 percent to 45 percent lead over Clinton, down from 10 points a month ago. Clinton, campaigning in Brownsburg, Indiana, tried to perpetuate the elitist label on Obama, pointing out his opposition to a proposal she supports, a temporary suspension of the federal tax on gasoline of 18.4 cents per gallon. ""I find it frankly a little offensive that people who don't have to worry about filling up their gas tank or what they buy when they go to the supermarket, think that it's somehow illegitimate to provide relief for the millions and millions of Americans who are on the brink of losing their jobs, unable to keep up with their daily expenses,"" she said. Later, in Jeffersonville, Indiana, Clinton said she wanted to put her tax proposal before Congress. ""I believe it would be important to get every member of Congress on record. Do they stand with the hard-pressed Americans who are trying to pay their gas bills at the gas station or do they once again stand with the oil companies?,"" Clinton asked. Still, Obama picked up an important endorsement in Indiana when former Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew announced he was switching support from Clinton to back Obama. INDIANA, NORTH CAROLINA Andrew, DNC chairman when Bill Clinton was president, is a so-called superdelegate to the party's nominating convention this summer and as such can vote for the candidate of his choosing. With Obama holding a small lead over Clinton in the race for committed delegates, superdelegates may ultimately decide the Democratic nominee. Indiana is one of two states, along with North Carolina, holding nominating contests on Tuesday that could have an impact on the race if either candidate wins both of them. Andrew said in a long letter explaining his switch it was time to ""heal the rift in our party,"" end the lengthy nominating process and pick a candidate to face McCain. The Clinton campaign found reason for optimism from a Quinnipiac University poll that showed Clinton topping McCain in a hypothetical matchup in the battleground states of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Clinton led McCain in those states with margins ranging from eight points in Florida to 10 in Ohio and 14 in Pennsylvania, the poll found. Obama beat McCain in Pennsylvania but was in a virtual tie with him in the other two states. Democrats tried to use against McCain the fifth anniversary of Bush's speech declaring an end to major combat operations in Iraq, an event quickly followed by a rising Iraqi insurgency that has kept U.S. forces in Iraq to the frustration of Americans. McCain, in Cleveland, defended his support for the current strategy in Iraq while denouncing the White House for putting a ""Mission Accomplished"" banner behind Bush on the USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1, 2003. ""I thought it was wrong at the time. I thought phrases like 'a few dead enders,' 'last throes,' all of those comments contributed over time to the frustration and sorrow of Americans,"" he told reporters. There was good and bad for McCain in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. He was in a statistical dead heat with both Obama and Clinton, but the survey said overall support for Republicans had fallen and 43 percent of Americans have ""major concerns"" McCain will be too closely aligned with the agenda of President George W. Bush."

en.15.65.322.2008.5.1,US army targets $400 mln for Afghan emergency funds,"BAGRAM, Afghanistan, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US military hopes to double its emergency funds for aid and reconstruction in Afghanistan this year, turning a once small-scale programme into a core part of its strategy to defeat Taliban insurgents. If the U.S. Congress approves, commanders on the ground say they could soon have as much as $410 million to finance new schools, roads, bridges and small hydro-electric power projects in rural areas, up from $206 million in 2007. The programme, known as the Commanders' Emergency Response Programme, or CERP, gives mid-level officers the authority and financial freedom to launch local reconstruction projects without the usual lengthy approval process from above. It has become a central to the military's counter-insurgency strategy as it seeks to quell the still-potent threat from the Taliban more than six years after U.S.-led and Afghan forces removed the hardline Islamists from power after they refused to surrender al Qaeda leaders behind the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The theory is that the sooner roads can be improved, clinics built, bridges repaired and power restored -- especially in areas along the Pakistan border -- the less likely the Taliban are to be let back in to vulnerable communities. British commanders in southern Afghanistan, where the Taliban is strong, have expressed envy in the past that they do not have the same funding or authority as their American counterparts to implement a similar strategy. In the two years they have been based in Helmand province, British forces have often taken towns and villages after a lengthy battle only to see them fall back into the hands of the Taliban shortly after they have withdrawn. ""This has got to be a two-fold process -- kinetic combat operations to drive out the insurgents followed right afterwards by the rebuilding work,"" U.S. Navy Lieutenant Ashwin Corattiyil, the CERP manager for eastern Afghanistan, said on Thursday. ""The prime reason CERP has the impact it does is its quick delivery. It's small scale but quick impact."" Corattiyil said $210 million had been set aside for Afghanistan's CERP spending in 2008, and an extra $200 million was pending approval from Congress. The programme has expanded steadily in Afghanistan since it was founded in Iraq in 2003 with money seized by U.S. forces from Saddam Hussein's regime. NGO CRITICISM While sabotage, including the Taliban burning down schools and clinics and attacking Afghans employed to build new roads, has set back some projects, many more are pushing ahead. U.S. army engineers have designed and helped build almost 90 micro-hydro-electric plants in the past three years, a process which involves diverting a portion of a river's flow so the water can power a generator that in turn provides basic power. Road-building, which costs anywhere from $100,000 per kilometre for a gravel road to $250,000/km for an asphalt one, has also become a major focus of engineering work. ""Roads can be a real moneymaker,"" said Lieutenant-Colonel Craft Smith, the head of engineering for the U.S. military's CJTF-101 task force, based in eastern Afghanistan. ""If you get a road opened up, you sometimes see the local souks (markets) quickly doubling in size -- it helps the local economy to pick up, and it makes it easier to get Afghan security forces to some of these places which helps."" Under CERP rules, battalion commanders -- usually lieutenant-colonels or majors -- can spend up to $25,000 at their own discretion. Task force commanders -- usually colonels -- can spend up to $200,000 on their own, and above that figure approval has to be sought from a commanding general. Big projects require oversight by separate legal, financial and contracting teams, but that once lengthy process has been streamlined so that it now takes as little as two to three weeks. Some NGOs and aid agencies have raised concerns the programme gives reconstruction projects too much military emphasis, but Corattiyil says there is consultation with third parties -- NGOs and ministries in the Afghan government -- to make sure there is agreement and as little overlap as possible."

Some 40 men riding in luxury vehicles and wearing uniforms of an elite police squad shot nine people dead in the town of Petatlan in the state of Guerrero on Sunday, El Universal newspaper reported. And a group toting automatic weapons killed seven people in the town of Iguala, also in Guerrero, on Saturday. Reforma newspaper said the ranchers were holding a meeting in Iguala and at least two of the sons of the association's state leader, Rogaciano Alba, were killed in Sunday's attack. Alba himself has survived two other attacks in the past, Reforma said. The newspapers did not say what could have triggered the attacks but well-armed drug traffickers are active in Guerrero, a poor, mountainous state on the Pacific coast home to the Acapulco beach resort. Clashes over land rights or local politics are also common in Guerrero."
en.15.65.216.2008.5.5,Hundreds protest against China chemical plant,"Beijing, May 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - About 200 people staged a rare protest in a city in southwest China against construction of a major petrochemical complex, saying it would lead to serious air and water pollution, local media reported on Monday. Protesters in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, marched peacefully for about two hours on Sunday to demonstrate against plans for an ethylene plant and an oil refinery on the city's northern outskirts, the Beijing News said. ""Because of fears that these two projects, when finished, could seriously pollute Chengdu's air and water resources, the people 'took a stroll' to express their opposition,"" the paper quoted an unnamed resident as saying. Ethylene is a commonly used industrial compound in packaging and insulation. It can be toxic in large doses and lead to nausea, loss of memory and even death. Construction had begun on one of the projects, the paper said, which would be located about 35 km (22 miles) north of Chengdu's city centre. The ethylene plant was slated to produce 800,000 tonnes of ethylene a year. The refinery, which would refine 10 million tonnes of crude a year, had been approved last month by the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top planning agency, the paper said. The projects were expected to provide more than 20,000 jobs, the paper said, citing an unnamed expert. The protesters were orderly and did not shout slogans or carry banners, the paper said. Protests against pollution and official abuse of power are common across China's vast countryside, but dissent is rarely voiced openly in more affluent cities. But along with rising property ownership, increasingly tenacious urban residents have become less tolerant of breakneck development, and have successfully organized to halt a number of controversial government-backed projects in recent years. Authorities in commercial capital Shanghai have shelved an extension to the city's high-speed ""maglev"" train after hundreds of people marched through city streets in January, saying they feared the train could emit radiation and bring down the value of their homes. Last year, thousands of street protesters in Xiamen, a resort town on China's southeast coast, lead authorities to abandon plans for a paraxylene plant on the outskirts of the city. bd"

en.15.65.64.2008.5.1,Barca defeat prompts calls for Nou Camp clear-out,"MADRID, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Less than two years after Barcelona strode to a magnificent victory in the Champions League, the side's narrow exit at the hands of Manchester United has all but erased the memory of that triumph. ""This team is finished,"" was the banner headline plastered on the front page of Barcelona-based daily Sport on Wednesday. ""It's the end of an era,"" said its rival El Mundo Deportivo. Even before the match, the volatile Catalan media had been sharpening their knives and calling for a clear-out of the squad at the end of the season, but the Old Trafford defeat has added a new sense of urgency to their demands. Ronaldinho, the player largely responsible for steering Barcelona to back-to-back league titles and their Champions League triumph in 2006, already has one foot out of the door. Coach Frank Rijkaard, midfielder Deco, defenders Rafael Marquez, Gianluca Zambrotta and Lilian Thuram and striker Thierry Henry have all joined the Brazilian on the list of likely discards. Although Rijkaard denied he had any plans to resign, the players admitted that the time had come for reflection on the club's decline in form over the past two seasons. ""Each one of us bears our part of the blame and we have to think about what can be done so that this team can get back to winning ways,"" Deco told reporters after the game. ""A club like Barcelona can't go two years without winning a trophy. In the league we have slipped up at key moments and we haven't been able to reach any final. We have to think carefully and discuss this within the club."" The irony of Barcelona's defeat was that although they played the more attractive football for much of the tie against United, it was their lack of fire-power up front that ended up sealing their fate. FANTASTIC FOUR At the start of the season with the arrival of Henry from Arsenal, the talk had been of a ""fantastic four"" in an attack comprising the French striker, Samuel Eto'o, Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho. The reality has been very different, however, and Barca's season has stalled because of their inability to score goals in key matches. Unsettled by personal problems and struggling to adapt to a new position on the left flank, Henry has failed to live up to his billing in his first season at the Nou Camp. Eto'o's season has once again been hampered by injury and absence at the African Nations Cup, and the Cameroon striker lacks the spark and predatory instinct that made him such an effective player two seasons ago. Messi's campaign has also been disrupted by injury and although the Argentine was Barca's most dangerous player on Tuesday, he looked to be fighting a lone battle up front. Ronaldinho is a story apart. Fitness and weight problems, a mysterious succession of injuries and an apparent lack of motivation have meant that the former World Player of the Year has taken almost no part in the current campaign. The only bright note has been the emergence of Bojan Krkic, but the 17-year-old has been used sparingly by Rijkaard and is a long way from being the finished product. However, it is not just the strikers that should take the blame for the blunting of the team's attacking power. The team lacks the intensity and pace that characterised its play two seasons ago, new fullbacks Zambrotta and Eric Abidal do not get forward and stretch opposition defences as much as their predecessors, while the midfield supply lines have become too slow and predictable. The club will be planning a major overhaul ahead of next season, but before that the present crop of players have some important unfinished business to attend to. The team is four points adrift of Villarreal in third place in the table and unless they can beat a revived Valencia and a dominant Real Madrid in their next two games they will almost certainly be condemned to playing in the Champions League qualifiers at the start of next season"
en.15.65.104.2008.5.5,"AC Milan cool on Ronaldinho, Flamini to sign","MILAN, May 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronaldinho is not needed at AC Milan, club owner Silvio Berlusconi said on Sunday, but Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini should sign a four-year-deal with the club on Monday. Milan had agreed personal terms with Ronaldinho's agent but have said Barcelona's price of 40 million euros ($62 million) for the Brazil forward is too much. Their pursuit of Ronaldinho intensified during Berlusconi's recent election campaign, where he won a third term as Italian prime minister, but now Milan's interest has cooled. ""I have always been doubtful over whether Ronaldinho is needed, at this point I really think we don't need him,"" Berlusconi told reporters as he left the San Siro after Milan beat derby rivals Inter 2-1. Milan's victory moved them up to fourth spot in Serie A, the final Champions League qualifying place, and meant Inter will have to wait another week for a victory which would seal a third successive Italian title. Frenchman Flamini, soon out of contract at Arsenal and also courted by Juventus, is arriving in Milan later on Sunday. ""If he passes the medical, tomorrow he will be a Milan player. Players want to come to Milan, of this there is no doubt,"" Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani told reporters, adding later that Flamini would sign a four-year contract"

With 84 percent of its children having these basic health needs unmet, Ethiopia placed on the bottom of the list in the report issued by the US-based humanitarian group. Save the Children also ranked 146 countries for how good they are for mothers and children. Sweden, Norway, Iceland, New Zealand and Denmark topped the list. Niger was last. The United States placed 27th, one spot below last year's ranking. The rankings were based on data that included immunization against childhood diseases such as malaria and tetanus, access to treatment for leading childhood killers such as diarrhea and pneumonia, prenatal care and other factors. Worldwide, more than 200 million children under age 5 do not get basic health care when they need it, with the poorest children being the worst off, Save the Children said. In the Philippines, 31 percent of children under 5 are missing out on such basic health care, the smallest proportion of any country in the report. Peru was next at 32 percent, then South Africa (34 percent) and Indonesia (35 percent). ""The Philippines nearly cut its child death rate in half since 1990. The health ministry, through USAID (US Agency for International Development) support, launched a number of health initiatives in 1989, including a push to increase access to oral rehydration therapy to treat diarrhea,"" David Oot, who heads the group's global health programs, told reporters. But inequities were still apparent, the group said. The poorest Filipino children were 3.2 times more likely to go without basic health measures. And Peru, despite placing second on the list, had the widest gap in child death rates between the rich and poor -- with the poorest children 7.4 times more likely to die than the richest. Ethiopia was last in the rankings, followed by Somalia (82 percent), Chad (78 percent), Yemen (71 percent) and Laos (69 percent), according to the report. Some developing countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan, were not included in the report due to insufficient data, Save the Children official Mary Beth Powers said. The report said in terms of sheer numbers, India had the most children -- 67 million -- not getting adequate health care, followed by Nigeria (16 million), Bangladesh (12 million), Ethiopia (11 million) and Pakistan (10 million)"

Bangladesh were bundled out for a paltry 68 in 30.2 overs after India racked up a challenging 250 for three in 50 overs riding on an unbeaten century from Mithali Raj. It was the first defeat for the Bangladeshi women in competitive cricket since they were introduced at the international stage last year. The women team have gone to play the Asian Cup after emerging unbeaten champions in the ACC Trophy and having defeated Hong Kong 4-0 at home, but the reality was totally different against the tougher side. After being put in to bowl first, Bangladesh had started positively reducing the formidable India to 48-2 in 17.3 overs, but noting went in their favour after that. Indian captain Raj pairing with Jaya Sharma put on 110 runs for the third wicket and eventually ended up at 250. Raj scored an attacking unbeaten century of 109 off 92 balls that included 15 fours and a six while opener Jaya Sharma made 72 off 118 balls featuring eight fours. Bangladesh, in reply, faced tough bowling from pacer Jhulan Goswami, who removed Shukhtara (2), Panna Gosh (1) and Shathira Jakir (12) in a row and finally returned four for 18. Bangladesh never recovered the damage and spinner Pujare Seema wiped the middle and tail claiming five wickets for 17 runs. Only two Bangladeshi players Sathira Zakir (12) and Irin Sultana (19) reached double digits. Bangladesh will take on Pakistan at the same venue Saturday.

The industry uses child labourers and exploits women workers, the report alleges. AFL-CIO, a voluntary federation of 56 national and international labour unions, last month published the report ""The True Cost of Shrimp"" on shrimp industries in Bangladesh and Thailand. But industry associations in Bangladesh said the report was based on old statistics. They said the report would create cynicism when the government and the associations were working together to implement the labour law made in October 2006. Industry leaders said the damning report would hurt the industry leading to buyers hesitating to import from Bangladesh. They also said that a vicious circle was working to ruin the shrimp industry. The report says a number of organisations have identified ""extensive worker and human rights abuses"" in the shrimp industry. It says ""most reports have concentrated on power imbalances on shrimp farming"", which help local power brokers grab lands from farmers to set up farms, causing environmental devastation. Organisations such as the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) have identified land grab, use of child and forced labour, and reduced local access to land, water and other resources as key abuses. Many international NGOs and development agencies also expressed concerns over the impact of shrimp trade on local peoples and the issues such as food safety and environmental preservation, according to the report by AFL-CIO. It also says the Solidarity Centre and its partner organisations had found labour abuses, including ""shifts over 12 hours a day, forced and unpaid overtime, failure to get minimum wages, inadequate healthcare and childcare resources, and insufficient health and safety standards at most facilities from interviewing shrimp processing workers"". On worker wages, the report says factory owners pay a ""perplexing variety of wages to workers most of which are very low"". The newer workers' pay is equivalent to $23 a month while more experienced ones earn more or less $26, the report says. Still, they are much fortunate than contract employees who work for piece rates and are often paid 15 cents for every 22 pounds of shrimp they clean, it says. Workers have to work from 8.00am to 8.00pm. Some say that they stand the entire time. Workers of five different processing companies noted a straight 26-hour shift that takes place every other Friday morning and ends Saturday evening. The pressing concern however is the industry's dependence on child labour, according to AFL-CIO. It is estimated that 13.4 percent of Bangladeshi children, aged 5 to 14, are labourers. ""They are involved in loading finished products onto trucks and not counted as a company's employee."" Speaking on the report, Syed Mahmudul Haque, chairman of Bangladesh Shrimp and Fish Foundation, said the report would create cynicism in a time when the associations and the government are working together to implement the labour law. ""The report used old statistics. It can cause boycott of our products by consumer-rights associations of different countries which would lead to a decline in exports as well as closures of plants and a rise in unemployment,"" he told bdnews24.com. Haque quoted Wally Stevens, executive director of Global Aquaculture Association (GAA), as saying they expect a solution to the problems rather than creating an ""air of uncertainty"". Stevens challenged the report in an interview on CNN that was aired in the US edition of the network. Stevens reportedly questioned why the authors chose to release the report without contacting GAA, arguably a leading global aquaculture standards-setting organisation. Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters' Association President Kazi Belayat echoed Haque. David John Wales, resident representative of American Centre for International Labour Solidarity, according to Belayat, also said the report had used old statistics. ""Our jute sector has already been destroyed. Now this is a new conspiracy to ruin our garments and shrimp industry,"" he told bdnews24.com. The BFFEA president claimed that the shrimp industry had already implemented 80 percent of the labour law. Bangladesh was among the world's top 10 shrimp producers in 2006 and it is rapidly expanding industry in Bangladesh, the report says. The report quoting a US government source said at least 142,000 families or more than 600,000 people depend directly on the industry. Bangladesh Shrimp and Fish Foundation puts the number at 600,000 direct workers, who support some 3.5 million dependants. bdnews2"
en.15.65.221.2008.4.30,CA asks agencies to brace for Nargis,"Dhaka, April 30 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Wednesday asked related agencies to take preparation and remain alert against cyclone Nargis, feared to intensify further. The directive came from a cabinet meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office after defence secretary Kamrul Hasan briefed advisers on the Bay cyclone in detail, CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters. At the same time, the CA also urged people not to panic ""unnecessarily"" about the cyclone. According to the latest weather bulletin, the severe cyclonic storm over the west central Bay and adjoining east central Bay has moved slightly north-northeastwards over the same area. The cyclone was centred at 6pm about 1000km southwest of Chittagong port, 935km southwest of Cox's Bazar port and 875km south-southwest of Mongla port. The chief adviser asked the Disaster Management Bureau and other related government agencies to watch the storm. He also asked deputy commissioners of districts to take cautionary steps, Munaim said after the cabinet meeting. The government had earlier asked farmers to speed up their rice harvest as the country braces for the powerful cyclone. Cyclone Sidr killed nearly 3,500 people last November. It destroyed 1.8 million tonnes of rice in the fields and left around two million people homeless. The storm was the most powerful to hit Bangladesh since an April cyclone killed 143,000 people in April 1991. Officials expect that boro, a major rice variety, will yield around 17.5 million tonnes this year, two million tonnes more than last year. If the harvest was completed without any losses, officials and economists hope food prices in markets, which nearly doubled over the past year, would start coming down. But Nargis is posing a new threat. Farmers began harvesting boro about a week ago but the officials said it would take another fortnight to complete. British-based storm tracking service Tropical Storm Risk (http://tsr.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/) rated Nargis as a category 2 storm and it was expected to reach category 4 strength in 36 hours. Category 5 is the maximum category for tropical cyclones. The Meteorological Department of Bangladesh issued a distant cautionary signal number 2 for Chittagong and other ports. OTHER CABINET DECISIONS After Wednesday's meeting, the CA's press secretary said the cabinet also gave a go-ahead to signing a memorandum of understanding on Oman-Bangladesh manpower exports. A delegation led by foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury would go to Oman on May 10. The MoU is likely to be signed during the visit, Munaim said. From 1976 to 1997, about 2,65,000 Bangladeshi workers went to Oman. At present, 1,75,000 Bangladeshis are working in the Middle Eastern country. The cabinet at Wednesday's meeting approved the Government Attorney General Service Ordinance 2008 and Contempt of Court Ordinance 2008. Munaim said the council of advisers gave final approval to amendments to Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council Act 1980. bdnews"
en.15.65.23.2008.5.2,Job cuts in April less severe than feared,"WASHINGTON, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Employers cut jobs for a fourth straight month in April but not as vigorously as feared, according to a government report on Friday that also showed an unexpected improvement in the unemployment rate last month. The Labor Department said 20,000 jobs were shed last month, far fewer than the 80,000 that economists surveyed by Reuters had anticipated would be lost. The report buoyed stock futures prices and sent the dollar's value higher. Bond prices weakened broadly as investors bet the jobs number reduced chances for more interest rate cuts by the US central bank. April's job reductions followed upwardly revised losses of 81,000 jobs in March and 83,000 in February. Employers also cut 76,000 jobs in January. The national unemployment rate eased to 5 percent from 5.1 percent in March, contrary to forecasts that it would pick up to 5.2 percent. Though the losses in jobs last month were less than forecast, they nonetheless represent continued deterioration in hiring prospects. The four-month string of monthly losses is the longest since a five-month stretch in 2003, when the economy was still in a so-called jobless recovery from the last recession in 2001. The moderation in the pace of losses may reinforce chances that the Federal Reserve, which cut official interest rates again earlier this week, will be able to pause its rate-slashing campaign. ""It looks like the economy is in better shape than we thought,"" said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of the US equity group for Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management in New York. ""I think a lot of people were expecting it to be a lot worse."" John Silvia, an economist with Wachovia Bank in Charlotte, NC, said the jobs data gave the Fed some breathing-room to assess the impact of substantial rate cuts it already has made. ""I think the employment decline was less than expected and consistent with a modest slowdown in the U.S. economy, possibly a recession, and I think it will allow the Fed time to look at the data going forward,"" Silvia said. Just before the April employment figures were issued, the Fed announced fresh action to add liquidity to credit markets, increasing the size of some cash auctions for financial institutions as well. The economy so far has skirted outright contraction, although it expanded only at a slim 0.6 percent annual rate in the first quarter. Some officials are sounding cautiously optimistic that the worst of a credit market crisis may be past despite persistent weakness in some sectors like housing. The Labor Department said 61,000 construction jobs were lost in April, the largest number for that sector since 103,000 were cut in February 2007. The department said that since peaking in September 2006, some 457,000 construction jobs have been lost. Goods-producing businesses cut 110,000 jobs in April, the largest number of job reductions since January 2002, after trimming 88,000 in March. But service industries added 90,000 jobs - the most since last December - with most of them coming in the health care and professional technical services sectors.

en.15.65.242.2008.5.4,Lego's latest brick trick: a virtual world,"Reed Stevenson BILLUND, Denmark, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Millions of children pick up Lego bricks each year to spend hours -- 5 billion, in fact -- creating their own imaginary worlds. Now the manufacturer of the little plastic playing blocks wants to take them online to ""Lego Universe,"" a virtual world for fans of the ubiquitous toy. Lego Universe joins an established trend where toys and video games are cross-promoted, such as Nintendo Co Ltd's Pokemon TV show, game card, toys and video game franchise, and Mattel Inc's Barbie online shopping and gaming portal at barbie.com. To launch next year as a massively multiplayer online game, or MMOG to those in the gaming community, Lego Universe will let players create online versions of themselves and interact with each other. ""We want to make the connection between digital play and physical play,"" said Mark William Hansen who is in charge of Lego Universe. ""The physical experience is our core, the digital experience will never replace the physical experience, but it's a nice add-on."" Hansen, speaking at the headquarters of Europe's largest toymaker, said he had been working on his doctoral thesis with Lego Group on mass customization and ended up joining the family-owned company to create the game. Lego Universe will blend real-world style environments with characters and buildings made of digital plastic pieces. A forest would have less bricks in the background, while a city would lend itself to being made nearly entirely with bricks. Each player's avatar, or online persona, will be a customizable digital version of Lego minifigures, the tiny characters included with most Lego kits that also feature in existing Lego video games such as Lego Star Wars. That's not surprising. Lego employees are just as likely to pull out a Lego figure of themselves, with name, phone number and e-mail address rather than a traditional business card. Lego Universe will initially launch as a PC game, available in stores or as a download, and may eventually be available on other gaming platforms. It will operate as a pay-as-you-go subscription service at a ""competitive price"", Hansen said. Most social online worlds have their own currency or monetary system, and Lego Universe will also require users to spend virtual money to buy virtual bricks. But rather than winning or beating an opponent, players build capital by spending time in the game. ""The more a child plays, they collect more coins and more bricks. The more you play, the more you get to build things,"" Hansen said. The other crucial element of Lego Universe, like other MMOGs, is that users will be encouraged to interact with each other, to build and play with virtual Lego bricks as they would on a carpet littered with real Lego pieces. ""We want kids to come and play together,"" Hansen said. BRICK-BY-BRICK Lego Universe is part of a bigger plan by the company to revitalize itself after a near-collapse five years ago, when the company founded in 1932 posted its first loss. Lego executives say the company lost its way by branching into non-core areas like television shows and toys that required less building and weren't customizable like the core Lego bricks. ""It was a near-death experience,"" said Henrik Lorensen, vice president of business development at Lego. Lorensen said Lego was distracted from its main area of expertise of providing toys children could use to build their own worlds and unleash their imagination, or as he says, ""the joy of building, of creation, that you have when you play."" Lorensen says the approach of ""making good, classic products in the right way"" is reflected in Lego Universe. About two dozen people at Lego are working on the game while an additional group of nearly 70 are working to create the online world in Denver, Colorado, where game developer and Lego partner NetDevil is based. The digital efforts fit in with Lego's popular video game franchise and also with Lego Factory, a digital design system that allows users to build Lego designs and then order the necessary components in one package from Lego. Through such efforts, Lego believes it can reach even more people than the 400 million who play with Lego bricks every year. Lego has expanded its line to include kits tailored for girls, featuring princesses and horses and castles. Lego Universe, the company believes, will encompass all of that and more, as the name suggests. Users will be able to create, destroy, enact battles, or just fiddle with bricks in a world of their own. It will also give the company the ability to reintroduce bricks that are no longer made in Lego factories and potentially offer all the 6,000 types of bricks made by Lego. But there will always be a link back to the physical world. Just like with Lego Factory, users will also be able to order the physical versions of their online creations and have them delivered to their door."
en.15.65.292.2008.5.5,Real leave it late to secure 31st title,"MADRID, May 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid fought their way back after a sending off and going a goal down to snatch a dramatic 2-1 victory at Osasuna and win their 31st league title on Sunday. With Villarreal beating Getafe 2-0 in an earlier match, Real had to win the game to take the title but suffered a major setback when defender Fabio Cannavaro was sent off at the start of the second half. Real looked to be in serious trouble when Osasuna midfielder Patxi Punal struck home from the penalty spot after Gabriel Heinze had handled in the area with eight minutes to go. But Dutch winger Arjen Robben equalised with three minutes to go, heading in after Gonzalo Higuain whipped a free kick into the area and the Argentine struck the winner when he lashed past Ricardo with a minute to go. With three matches left to play, Real have an unassailable 10-point lead over Villarreal at the top of the table. Earlier, Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci scored twice to give Villarreal a 2-0 victory at home to Getafe. Nihat put Villarreal ahead late in the first half when he side-footed in at the far post after fellow striker Giuseppe Rossi had sped down the left flank and slid the ball across the face of the goal. He took his tally for the season to 17 a minute before the break, having time to tee up his shot and pick his spot after Robert Pires had crossed the ball to the far post. Third-placed Barcelona hammered a beleaguered Valencia 6-0 at the Nou Camp, to record their first win in six games. Midweek defeat against Manchester United in the Champions League condemned Barca to a second successive trophyless season and they appeared stung by the criticism levelled at the team as they stormed into a 3-0 lead in under 15 minutes. Lionel Messi scored Barca's first goal in five games in all competitions when he opened from the penalty spot after he was brought down in the area by Alexis. Xavi made it 2-0 when he drilled in from 20 metres on eight minutes and Thierry Henry added a third by steering home after Samuel Eto'o cut the ball back from the byline. COOL FINISHING Henry scored his ninth of the season when he curled in from the edge of the area, after the break and Bojan Krkic wrapped up with two cool finishes after some dreadful defending from the Valencia back four. Valencia, who have lost five of their last six league games, remain just two points above the relegation zone. Real Murcia were relegated after they squandered a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 at Racing Santander and will now join Levante in the second division. Javier Clemente's side ended the game with nine men after defender Alvaro Mejia and Stephane Pignol were both sent off in the space of two minutes late in the second half. Racing's victory left them just two points behind fourth-placed Atletico Madrid and kept them in the hunt for the Champions League places. Spanish striker Daniel Guiza went to the top of the Primera Liga scoring charts when he took his tally for the season to 24 with his double in Real Mallorca's 2-1 win at Athletic Bilba"

en.15.65.79.2008.5.1,Nation observes May Day,"Dhaka, May 01 (bdnews24.com)Labour organisations across the country observed the historic May Day amid a state of emergency. As the government did not permit labour-rights campaigners to bring out processions or rallies, May Day programmes have been limited to indoor discussions. On May 1, 1886, workers of the US city Chicago had staged demonstrations near Haymarket demanding eight hours' workday instead of the 12-hour workday prevalent at that time. Police had opened fire in a bid to quell the agitation, when 10 workers got killed. But that sacrifice ultimately led to the authorities yielding to the workers' demand and the eight-hour workday came to be introduced universally. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed issued separate messages to mark the day wishing all workers prosperity and happiness. At the Muktangan at 9am Thursday, the police dispersed the May Day observance committee's rally. At 10am, committee members reassembled at Dhaka Reporters' Unity auditorium and condemned police action at a press conference. At 9:30am, the Jatiya Garments Worker Federation's women workers rally also had to be rushed through due to police intervention. Aminul Haque Amin, general secretary of the federation, demanded that the embargo on trade unions should be lifted immediately, the women's development policy be implemented, labour law amendment ordinance 2008 be annulled and introduction of factory-based rationing. Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman in his message called upon the workers to work sincerely toward building a graft-free nation and society. A joint message issued by BNP's M Saifur Rahman, Hafizuddin Ahmed and Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan greeted the workers across the country and wished them joy. Khandaker Delwar Hossain, who leads BNP's other faction, also wished everybody including the workers happiness and prosperity on the occasion. Former president AQM Badruddozza, retired major Abdul Mannan and JSD president Hasanul Huq Inu expressed their solidarity with the workers everywhere. The CA inaugurated a discussion and a three-day fair on May 1. The Dhaka metropolitan committee of Bangladesh Kalyan Party arranged a discussion at Shahjahanpur auditorium. Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies also organised May Day lectures, photography exhibition and a cultural show at the National Press Club. bdnews24."
en.15.65.424.2008.5.5,Yemen army warns rebels to heed truce,"SANAA, Mon May 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Yemen's army has warned rebels led by Abdul-Malik al-Houthi that it will move to subdue them if they fail to implement a truce brought to the verge of collapse by a mosque bombing and days of clashes. Qatari mediators returned to Yemen's volatile northern province of Saada on Sunday, hoping to salvage the ceasefire agreement that ended six months of fighting between government forces and the rebels last June. Violence flared again in recent weeks as a lack of trust on both sides and disagreements over the release of prisoners and handover of arms threaten to undermine the deal. On Friday a bomb killed 15 people outside a mosque in Saada. A senior Yemeni military official blamed Houthi and his followers for the bombing, a charge the rebel leader denies. The official warned in a statement on Yemen's state news agency that unless Houthi abides by the truce ""the state would be forced to assume its responsibility to spread the sovereignty of the regime and its law across all areas of Saada province."" Fighting has raged on and off in Saada since a conflict broke out in 2004 between government forces and Houthi's rebels, members of the Zaydi sect of Shi'ite Islam. Yemeni officials say the rebels want to return to a form of clerical rule prevalent in the country until the 1960s. The rebels, who want Zaydi schools and oppose the government's alliance with the United States, say they are defending their villages against what they call government aggression. Sunni Muslims form a majority of Yemen's 19 million population, while most of the rest are Zaydis. MEDIATION The Qatari-mediated ceasefire agreement committed Yemen to rebuilding rebel areas and required rebels to give up heavy arms but did not include a clear mechanism for implementation. The rebels fear that if they give up their weapons and prisoners first, they will be attacked. The government is reluctant to release its prisoners since a state amnesty that freed 600 rebels in 2006 failed to end the revolt. Ali Abu Halaiqa, head of the government delegation, said that a mechanism was now being drawn up. ""We affirm that the political authority wants to resolve this problem in a peaceful way,"" he told Yemeni television. ""The first step is to end the clashes between the two sides."" A source close to Houthi said the Qataris along with the government delegation had met the chief rebel negotiator Saleh Habra on Sunday evening, raising hopes that a deal could be reached on implementing the ceasefire after a bloody week. Mediation by local tribes had succeeded in calming tensions in the province on Sunday, the source said, following heavy clashes that saw the army use tank fire against the rebels after they attacked a government building in Manbah. Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands have fled their homes in Saada since the conflict began. One of the poorest countries outside Africa, Yemen is also grappling with dwindling oil and water resources, unemployment, corruption and a large community of Somali refugees"
en.15.65.152.2008.5.6,Racial disparities persist in drug arrests,"Washington,May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US ""war on drugs"" disproportionately targets urban minority neighborhoods with African Americans being arrested and imprisoned on drug charges at much higher rates, according to a pair of reports released on Monday by rights groups. New York-based Human Rights Watch said a review of new statistics across 34 states found persistent racial disparities among drug offenders sent to prison. The 67-page report concludes that a black man is 11.8 times more likely than a white man to be sent to prison on drug charges, and a black woman is 4.8 times more likely than a white woman. In 16 states, African Americans are sent to prison for drug offenses at rates between 10 and 42 times greater than the rate for whites, the report said. ""Most drug offenders are white, but most of the drug offenders sent to prison are black,"" said Jamie Fellner, a Human Rights Watch official and author of the report. ""The solution is not to imprison more whites but to radically rethink how to deal with drug abuse and low-level drug offenders."" Wisconsin, Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland, West Virginia, Colorado, New York, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan were listed as the 10 states with the greatest racial disparities in prison admissions for drug offenders. In a separate study, the Washington-based Sentencing Project examined data from 43 of the largest American cities between 1980 and 2003. The study found that, since 1980, the rate of drug arrests for African Americans increased by 225 percent, compared to 70 percent among whites. In nearly half of the cities, the odds of arrest for a drug offense among African Americans relative to whites more than doubled, the report said. Among other findings, the report said African-American drug arrests increased at 3.4 times the rate of whites despite similar rates of drug use. ""These trends come not as the result of higher rates of drug use among African Americans, but, instead, the decisions by local officials about where to pursue drug enforcement,"" said Ryan King, a policy analyst for The Sentencing Project. The project and Human Rights Watch recommended the elimination of mandatory minimum sentences and a return to judicial discretion in the sentencing of drug offenders"
en.15.65.227.2008.5.4,"Gunmen pull Iraqi journalist from car, kill her","Mosul, Iraq, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen shot dead an Iraqi reporter on Sunday after pulling her out of a car in northern Mosul, a notoriously violent city where journalists are often targeted and live in fear of their life. Police said Serwa Abdul-Wahab, in her mid-30s, was on her way to work when gunmen forced her from her taxi in eastern Mosul, 390 km (240 miles) north of Baghdad, and shot her in the head. There were conflicting reports about who she worked for and police were not immediately able to say why she might have been attacked. Iraq, which witnessed significant growth in the media after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, is the most dangerous place in the world for journalists to work, according to New York-based journalism watchdog the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Iraqi journalists have been targeted because of their work or caught up in the cross-fire of Iraq's many-sided conflict. Most television stations and newspapers in Iraq are owned by political, religious sects or ethnic groups. The CPJ estimates that 127 journalists, both Iraqi and foreign, have been killed since 2003. That figure does not include Abdul-Wahab. Gunmen killed the head of Iraq's biggest journalist organization, Shihab al-Tamimi, 74, in an attack on his car in Baghdad in February. In all, three journalists have been killed this year. The CPJ, which calls the Iraq war the deadliest conflict for journalists in recent history, said in a report last week that Iraq had the worst record of failing to solve murders of journalists. There were 79 unsolved murders, it said. Many journalists in Mosul keep a low profile, fearful of attracting the attention of al Qaeda, which has threatened media workers there with death. The U.S. military says Mosul is the last urban stronghold of the Sunni Islamist group."
en.15.65.240.2008.5.6,Fear of child virus spreads to China`s capital,"Beijing, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fear of a virus that has infected thousands of children gripped parents in China's capital and financial hub on Tuesday, as the number of cases of hand, foot and mouth disease mounted across the country. Some 11,905 cases of the virus have been reported in China this year, the official Xinhua news agency said. The virus has caused 26 deaths, largely in Fuyang, a city in China's eastern province of Anhui. But parents in northern Beijing, host of the 2008 Olympics which begin in August, were also on the alert. ""Of course we're worried. If a child got sick, we'd be very frightened,"" said one woman, bouncing a toddler on her hip. ""We know about this virus, but we don't know clearly how to protect ourselves. The information hasn't been thorough enough."" Hand, foot and mouth disease is a common illness in children and infants caused by a family of viruses called enteroviruses, and outbreaks regularly occur in China. But the current outbreak has led to fatalities mostly when the cases have been linked with enterovirus 71, which can cause a severe form of the disease that can lead to high fever, paralysis and viral meningitis. Beijing has had 4,496 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease this year, mostly in children under 5, though it has had no fatalities, the Beijing News reported. The city's Centre for Disease Control has advised that any child found with the illness should be isolated at home, and that if more than three children in a single classroom were infected the class should be suspended, the newspaper said. A doctor from a Beijing children's hospital declined permission for interviews there, saying it could cause panic. ""Parents are already very nervous, and if they see a camera, they would think that our hospital has such cases and they will take away their children,"" the doctor told Reuters. ""We are facing great pressure these days,"" she added. Shanghai, China's financial centre, has reported no cases, but the city government nonetheless ordered kindergartens and primary schools to step up daily monitoring and emphasize more hand-washing and sterilizing of furniture and toys. The World Health Organization has cautioned that the virus, which spreads mostly through contact with infected blisters or faeces, could be yet to peak. China, which initially covered up the SARS epidemic in 2003, in a scandal which contributed to its spread and led to the sacking of Beijing's mayor and health minister, has ordered authorities to aggressively tackle hand, foot and mouth. An editorial in Monday's China Daily blamed the crisis in Fuyang on a ""delayed reaction"" by the local government. But at least one Beijing resident said he had confidence in the government's efforts. ""Before, when SARS hit, that was the scariest time,"" said He Xinping, the father of an 8-year-old. ""But now, with Beijing hosting the Olympics, the city is certain to increase its efforts."
en.15.65.143.2008.5.1,Emotions run high as Chelsea reach final,"LONDON, May 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea reached the Champions League final for the first time on Wednesday, beating Liverpool 3-2 after extra time at rain-lashed Stamford Bridge to set up a meeting with Manchester United in Moscow next month. Two goals from Didier Drogba and a penalty from a grieving Frank Lampard gave them a 4-3 aggregate victory in a dramatic semi-final against the side that had knocked them out twice at this stage in the last three seasons. Liverpool's goals came from Fernando Torres and Ryan Babel, whose speculative 40-metre shot three minutes from the end of extra time somehow bamboozled Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech and revived Liverpool's hopes for the last few minutes. But Chelsea held on in an absorbing match that was in the balance until the final kick to repay billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich for the millions of pounds he has invested in the west London club since taking over in 2003. They can now look forward to facing Manchester United in the first all-English Champions League final on May 21. ""It has not sunk in properly,"" said Chelsea captain John Terry. ""We will enjoy tonight but it will take 24 hours to sink in. I think everyone is looking forward to an all-English final. It will be a very tough game in three weeks' time."" HAPPY GRANT Chelsea coach Avram Grant added: ""I'm very very happy. Every time you create history is something special. We created history and I'm very proud that I did it in my way and I don't want to say 'I' but it is time to thank everybody."" United, whose manager Alex Ferguson was at Stamford Bridge to watch the semi-final, secured their place in the showpiece on Tuesday when they eliminated Barcelona at Old Trafford. While Drogba was the scoring hero on Wednesday with two excellent, powerfully-executed goals, the remarkable Lampard was the emotional focus of Chelsea's ecstatic fans. The England midfielder, back in the team following the death of his 58-year-old mother Pat last week, wept after scoring the decisive penalty that put them 2-1 ahead in the 98th minute and got a standing ovation when he was substituted near the end. He had a decisive impact on the match, too, beginning the move that led to Chelsea's opening goal after 33 minutes and which Drogba completed after Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina did well to parry a fiercely struck shot from Salomon Kalou. Liverpool, who had not scored at Stamford Bridge in their last eight visits, broke that hoodoo in the 64th minute when Torres equalised after a brilliant run from Yossi Benayoun. TORRES STRIKES The Israel midfielder sent Chelsea's defence into a spin, playing the final ball through Ricardo Carvalho's legs. It was Torres's 31st goal of the season and enough to take the game to extra time where the match turned Chelsea's way again in a five-minute spell midway through the first period. First, Michael Essien appeared to have put Chelsea 2-1 ahead and ran half the length of the pitch celebrating before everyone realised his strike had been disallowed for offside. However, two minutes later Chelsea were ahead once more when Lampard sent Reina the wrong way from the penalty spot after Sami Hyypia had fouled Michael Ballack. Lampard., who missed Saturday's Premier League win over leaders Manchester United after his mother died last Thursday, was engulfed by his team mates but could not hide his tears. Ivory Coast captain Drogba appeared to have finally killed Liverpool off when he turned in a cross from Nicolas Anelka with pinpoint precision after 105 minutes. But Liverpool, five times European champions, winners under coach Rafa Benitez in 2005 and beaten finalists last year, never gave up and got an unlikely reprieve with Babel's goal. That, though, was their last hurrah as Chelsea held on to celebrate an epic win in front of their delirious fans. ""It is something amazing,"" said Drogba. ""I think today we played very well -- I am really pleased for the club because we have been looking for this final for too long. ""Today what we achieved is fantastic for the"

en.15.65.106.2008.5.6,Breast-fed children found smarter,"Washington,May 06 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A new study provides some of the best evidence to date that breast-feeding can make children smarter, an international team of researchers said on Monday. Children whose mothers breast-fed them longer and did not mix in baby formula scored higher on intelligence tests, the researchers in Canada and Belarus reported. About half the 14,000 babies were randomly assigned to a group in which prolonged and exclusive breast-feeding by the mother was encouraged at Belarussian hospitals and clinics. The mothers of the other babies received no special encouragement. Those in the breast-feeding encouragement group were, on average, breast-fed longer than the others and were less likely to have been given formula in a bottle. At 3 months, 73 percent of the babies in the breast-feeding encouragement group were breast-fed, compared to 60 percent of the other group. At 6 months, it was 50 percent versus 36 percent. In addition, the group given encouragement was far more likely to give their children only breast milk. The rate was seven times higher, for example, at 3 months. The children were monitored for about 6 1/2 years. The children in the group where breast-feeding was encouraged scored about 5 percent higher in IQ tests and did better academically, the researchers found. Previous studies had indicated brain development and intelligence benefits for breast-fed children. But researchers have sought to determine whether it was the breast-feeding that did it, or that mothers who prefer to breast-feed their babies may differ from those who do not. The design of the study -- randomly assigning babies to two groups regardless of the mothers' characteristics -- was intended to eliminate the confusion. 'MOTHERS WHO BREAST-FEED ... ARE DIFFERENT' ""Mothers who breast-feed or those who breast-feed longer or most exclusively are different from the mothers who don't,"" Dr. Michael Kramer of McGill University in Montreal and the Montreal Children's Hospital said in a telephone interview. ""They tend to be smarter. They tend to be more invested in their babies. They tend to interact with them more closely. They may be the kind of mothers who read to their kids more, who spend more time with their kids, who play with them more,"" added Kramer, who led the study published in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry. The researchers measured the differences between the two groups using IQ tests administered by the children's pediatricians and by ratings by their teachers of their school performance in reading, writing, math and other subjects. Both sets of scores were significantly higher in the children from the breast-feeding promotion group. The study was launched in the mid-1990s. Kramer said the initial idea was to do it in the United States and Canada, but many hospitals in those countries by that time had begun strongly encouraging breast-feeding as a matter of routine. The situation was different in Belarus at the time, he said, with less routine encouragement for the practice. Kramer said how breast-feeding may make children more intelligent is unclear. ""It could even be that because breast-feeding takes longer, the mother is interacting more with the baby, talking with the baby, soothing the baby,"" he said. ""It could be an emotional thing. It could be a physical thing. Or it could be a hormone or something else in the milk that's absorbed by the baby."" Previous studies have shown babies whose mothers breast-fed them enjoy many health advantages over formula-fed babies. These include fewer ear, stomach or intestinal infections, digestive problems, skin diseases and allergies, and less risk of developing high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that women who do not have health problems exclusively breast-feed their infants for at least the first six months, with it continuing at least through the first year as other foods are introduced."

Rajib with white pieces took 41 moves to beat Reefat in the final game held at the Bangladesh Chess Federation auditorium. Rajib earned his first GM norm in 2002 in the 35th Olympiad in Slovenia and the second norm came in the Master Chess Championship in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates in 2007. ""I was confident of earning Grand Master's third norm this year and I had started the meet on the right note,"" Rajib told bdnews24.com by phone.

Zia beat Javed to become champion in the national championship for the 10th time. b"
en.15.65.248.2008.5.5,Obama damaged by Wright flap: USA Today/Gallup poll,"Washington, Mon May 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama's standing has been significantly damaged by the controversy over his former pastor, according to USA Today/Gallup poll published on Monday. The poll showed Hillary Clinton leading Obama 51 percent to 44 percent nationally among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters, in contrast to a CBS News/New York Times survey released on Sunday that had Obama leading Clinton by 12 points. Clinton and Obama face voting contests on Tuesday in North Carolina and Indiana, the next steps in their battle for the Democratic presidential nomination to take on presumptive Republican nominee John McCain in the November election. The USA Today/Gallup results were a sharp reversal from two weeks ago, before the latest controversy over the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, when Obama led Clinton by 10 percentage points. The Thursday-through-Saturday survey had a 5 percentage-point margin of error. USA Today said the results showed the Wright controversy had raised questions for some voters about Obama's values, credibility and electability. By contrast, the CBS News/New York Times poll released on Sunday showed the Illinois senator leading Clinton 50 percent to 38 percent among Democratic voters and said 60 percent approved of how Obama handled the furor over the Chicago minister's public comments. That poll surveyed 671 adults, including 283 Democratic primary voters, last Thursday through Saturday. Wright has angered many voters with repeated statements that the September 11 attacks were retribution for US foreign policies and that the US government had a hand in spreading AIDS to harm blacks. Obama has publicly severed ties with Wright. Obama sought to put controversy behind him on Monday, the eve of Democratic Party showdowns against Clinton in Indiana and North Carolina. ""We've probably taken as many hits as anybody has in this presidential campaign. Senator Clinton has not. John McCain certainly has not, and yet I'm still here and competitive in both North Carolina and Indiana,"" Obama told CNN. The USA Today poll said one-third of primary voters were less likely to vote for Obama because of his ties to Wright. The results also showed the same portion less likely to vote for Clinton, a New York senator, because of her husband, former President Bill Clinton. About 38 percent of likely voters said they were less likely to vote for McCain, an Arizona senator, because of his ties to President George W. Bush"
en.15.65.470.2008.5.7,"Oil above $122 but many equities, dollar climb","LONDON, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil traded above $122 a barrel on Wednesday but global equity markets generally rose and the dollar climbed on waning fears about the credit crisis. The price of crude was at $122.09, just off its all-time high of $122.73 a barrel hit on Tuesday, held up by supply worries and pending US weekly inventory data. Oil is up more than 8.5 percent this month and has gained 27 percent since the beginning of the year, raising worries about inflation and crimping the ability of central banks to fight a spreading economic slowdown. It has, however, yet to derail a global stock market rally that began in late March. European shares were higher with the FTSEurofirst 300 gaining 0.2 percent. Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.4 percent to a four-month closing high of 14,102.48. The broader TOPIX index gained 1.2 percent to 1,393.28. ""The market's mood has changed. We are past the worst, but it's too early to be fully optimistic,"" said Noritsugu Hirakawa, strategist at Okasan Securities. Emerging market shares, however, were weak, with Hong Kong's Hang Sen index down some 2.5 percent. Wall Street closed higher overnight, boosted by reassurances from Fannie Mae, the largest US home finance company, about the credit and housing markets. Some investors urged caution, however. ""Everyone would like it to be over but these things don't just happen overnight,"" said Martin Angel, a dealer at Australia's Patersons Securities. DOLLAR RISES The dollar strengthened, heading towards a two-month high against a basket of currencies after comments from a Federal Reserve official added to a view that the cycle of aggressive US interest rate cuts may be ending. Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig said late on Tuesday that rates will need to be raised in a timely way as the central bank grapples with a serious threat of inflation, prodding the euro towards a five-week low versus the dollar. The euro slipped roughly 0.3 percent to the day's low around $1.5465. The dollar rose more than 0.2 percent to 105.02 yen, nearing a two-month high around 105.70 yen touched on Friday. Euro zone government bonds were selling off amid oil-induced worries about inflation and the Fed comments. The 10-year yield was up 5 basis points at 4.188 percent while the 2-year was up 3 basis at 3.812 percent"
en.15.65.415.2008.5.4,Deaths reported after cyclone Nargis hammers Myanmar,"BANGKOK, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A large tropical cyclone that slammed into Yangon, toppling buildings and trees in military-ruled Myanmar's main city, has killed people, a resident said on Sunday, citing state radio and television reports. ""They said that people had been killed, but they don't know the numbers,"" the person, a local British embassy employee, told Reuters in Bangkok via satellite phone. She asked not to be identified. Major casualties are feared after Cyclone Nargis, packing winds of 190 km (120 mile) per hour, ploughed through the heart of the sprawling river delta city of 5 million on Saturday. Trees and powerlines were ripped up across the city and buildings toppled in the posh suburbs surrounding Yangon University, a Thailand-based, anti-regime activist group told Reuters. Internet, land, mobile and most satellite phone connections have been down since the storm neared the former Burmese capital, making it impossible to confirm the extent of the damage. The state media reports gave few other details, the British embassy employee said, although she added that by 8.30 am (0200 GMT) on Sunday the rain had passed and the sun was shining. Kyaw Lin Oo of Thailand-based Burma Democratic Concern, who managed to contact a Yangon colleague on Saturday night, said the whole city was ""in a very bad condition"". ""All the trees have been uprooted and some buildings have fallen down near Yangon University,"" he told Reuters in the Thai capital. ""REALLY BIG WHACK"" On Saturday, a United Nations official in Bangkok said U.N. staff had spoken to a colleague in Yangon as the eye of the storm passed overhead in the afternoon. ""A lot of roofs from well-constructed buildings have been blown off. That would lead you to believe that less well-constructed buildings will have taken a really big whack,"" Tony Craig, regional emergency coordinator for the World Food Programme (WFP), told Reuters. The Federation of Trade Unions, Burma, a Thailand-based labor rights group, said the ruling military junta had declared states of emergency in five affected provinces, most of them in the low-lying floodplains of the Irrawaddy delta. A spokesman for Britain's Department for International Development (DFID), which has a staff of 10 in Myanmar, said it had not been able to establish the extent of damage because of poor communications, but that its people were safe. The electricity supply in Yangon -- hit-and-miss at the best of times in one of Asia's poorest countries -- failed after Nargis drew near on Friday evening. Meteorological officials warned of a possible storm surge of up to 12 feet in coastal areas, suggesting tens of thousands of people could be at risk. The streets of Yangon were virtually deserted, and buses and trains were not operating due to extensive flooding, a Reuters reporter in the city said before his communications were cut off. A spokeswoman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in Yangon would meet with the Myanmar Red Crescent on Sunday to assess the damage. It remains to be seen what impact the storm will have on a referendum on an army-drafted constitution scheduled for May 10. The charter is part of a ""roadmap to democracy"" meant to culminate in multiparty elections in 2010 and end nearly five decades of military rule. Critics say it gives the army too much control. Naypyidaw, the generals' new capital, is 240 miles north of Yangon. An official at Yangon International Airport said all incoming flights had been diverted to the second city of Mandalay, in the middle of the southeast Asian nation, and all departures from Yangon had been cancelled. Thai Airways in Bangkok said they would decide at 0700 GMT whether to resume flights. Weather forecasters said Nargis was likely to keep moving northeast into northern Thailand, where a storm warning has already been issued."

Yahoo shares were down 19.7 percent in Frankfurt at 14.55 euros ($22.50) at 0820 GMT, while Microsoft rose 3.7 percent. Microsoft on Saturday sweetened its initial $31 per share offer for Yahoo to $33, but then withdrew from the talks when Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang dug in for a price of $37. Yahoo shares closed at $28.67 on Friday. Yahoo now faces growing pressure to find an alternative strategy to Microsoft's $47.5 billion takeover offer. It is likely to push for an advertising partnership with Web search leader Google Inc, sources familiar with the matter said on Sunday. A tie-up with Google, seen as a big winner from the end of Microsoft-Yahoo talks, should help boost Yahoo's operating performance in the near term. Google shares rose 3.4 percent in Frankfurt on Monday. Yahoo is also still considering a deal with another Internet media and advertising major, such as Time Warner Inc's AOL, people familiar with the discussions said. ""Yang is certainly under a lot of pressure now,"" said Roland Hirschmueller, an equities trader at German brokerage Baader. ""His days are numbered, if he doesn't manage to come with an alternative strategy,"" he added"

Light short-covering kept cash gold near late New York levels after losing about 6 percent in the last week. Gold fell as far as $847.10 an ounce on Thursday -- the lowest since early January. By 0611 GMT, spot gold was at $849.80/850.75 an ounce, slightly down from $850.25/851.65 in late New York. ""The trend is clearly downward. Sentiment deteriorated further after slipping below the psychological level of $850,"" said Tatsuo Kageyama, analyst at Kanetsu Asset Management in Tokyo. ""Gold was falling as the dollar rebounded strongly. The outlook for gold also turned very weak after seeing sharp drawdowns in gold ETFs."" Gold held in New York-listed StreetTRACKS Gold Shares XAUEXT-NYS-TT, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell to 580.45 tonnes as of Wednesday, shedding nearly 10 percent of its holdings in the last 10 days. Kageyama said gold could fall further and could test $800 depending on the moves in the dollar and oil prices. Cash gold slipped through key moving average levels following falls in the past two weeks. The next key support is around the 200-day moving average of $823.46. COMEX gold futures rebounded on Friday after losing 1.6 percent in New York. The June contract GCM8 was up $1.3 or 0.15 percent at $852.2 from the New York settlement. Japanese precious metals futures fell sharply in line with falls in post-Tokyo trade on Thursday, with gold futures down 1.5 percent at a one-month low and platinum diving nearly 4 percent to a five-week low. The key April 2009 gold contract on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange was trading down 44 yen, or 1.5 percent, at 2,887 yen per gram from the previous day's 2,931 yen. On Thursday, the dollar rose to five-week highs against the euro after a key U.S. manufacturing index for April came in slightly better than expected. Traders were awaiting the April U.S. employment report due at 1230 GMT. Economists in a Reuters survey expect to see 80,000 jobs lost in the month, a repeat of the March loss. The unemployment rate is seen at 5.2 percent compared with a 5.1 percent a month earlier. U.S. crude oil futures fell on easing supply worries in Nigeria and concerns that demand, especially in the United States, is being curbed by high prices. Front-month U.S. crude for June delivery CLc1 was down 64 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $111.88 a barrel on electronic trading.

en.15.65.214.2008.5.2,Microsoft poised to detail next moves on Yahoo: CEO,"San Francisco, May 2 (bdnews24.com/reuters)- Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Thursday that walking away from a deal with Yahoo remained one of ""three big options"" the company is weighing and to expect an announcement shortly. Neither side would comment on whether they were seeking a last-minute deal before Microsoft makes good on its threat to turn its unsolicited bid, currently worth $42.4 billion, into a hostile takeover battle. The Wall Street Journal reported late on Thursday that Microsoft appeared to be leaning toward going hostile in its pursuit of the Internet company, citing people familiar with the matter. An announcement could come on Friday, the Journal said. A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment. But in a sign that Yahoo continues to resist Microsoft's embrace, a source familiar with discussions between Yahoo and Google Inc said a partnership could come as early as next week. The non-exclusive partnership would involve Yahoo carrying Google advertising alongside Yahoo's Web search results. Such a partnership would not preclude a deal with Microsoft, the source said. Ballmer told employees during a regularly scheduled company Town Hall meeting that Yahoo is valuable as part of a strategy to beat Microsoft arch-rival Google, but there are limits on the price Microsoft is ready to pay. ""Yahoo's not a strategy, it's a part of a strategy,"" Ballmer declared. His remarks were first reported by Silicon Alley Insider, whose reporter said he monitored the internal conference call. A company spokesman confirmed the comments. ""We're interested to pay for it at some level and beyond that level we're not willing to pay for it. I know exactly what Yahoo is worth to me ... I won't go a dime above and I will go to what I think it's worth if that gets the deal done,"" he said. Microsoft has promised this would be the week that it spells out its next moves if Yahoo allowed a deadline set for last Saturday to expire on its three-month-old offer to buy Yahoo for $31 per share in cash and stock. Seeking to force Yahoo to the negotiating table in early April, Ballmer wrote a letter to Yahoo's board of directors threatening to cut the bid and mount a proxy fight to remove the board if Yahoo did not reach a deal by April 26. Ballmer went further last week by saying Microsoft was considering walking away from the deal. But most Wall Street analysts dismiss this as a hardball negotiating tactic rather than a real threat to end its two-year-long pursuit of a deal. On Thursday, five days after Microsoft's deadline for reaching a negotiated deal expired, Ballmer told employees ""we ought to announce something in very short order."" ""We've got basically the three big options in front of us,"" Ballmer summarized. ""There's the friendly deal, there's an unfriendly deal, (and the) third path is simply to walk away."" The two companies are in a standoff over price. Yahoo responded within weeks of receiving the unsolicited takeover bid by saying the offer ""substantially undervalues"" it. It has sought other partners, while not ruling out a Microsoft deal. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Microsoft had told Yahoo it was willing to raise its bid to as much as $33 a share, but was unwilling to go as high as the $35 to $37 a share for which Yahoo's major investors have lobbied. Ballmer repeated the key reasons for buying Yahoo were that it would allow Microsoft to move faster in creating a credible No. 2 to Google, which dominates key segments of the Internet market and is expanding rapidly in new directions. Yahoo would provide Microsoft scale, a bigger audience for Web search -- a key starting point for many Internet users -- and a stronger presence in online advertising, he said. ""The world is rooting for us,"" Ballmer said. ""The world hopes that there's ... a very strong company that's not the number one guy,"" he said, referring to Google. Most Wall Street analysts believe Microsoft's most likely next move is to begin a months-long proxy campaign, according to a Reuters poll conducted late last week. Analysts believe Microsoft will win but at great cost to Yahoo employee morale. bd"
en.15.65.323.2008.5.7,Road gets rockier for Hillary Clinton,"Washington, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The road just got rockier for Democrat Hillary Clinton in her battle to win her party's presidential nomination. The New York senator and former first lady barely survived a strong challenge from rival Barack Obama in Indiana and was routed by him in North Carolina. Obama inched ever closer to clinching the right to face Republican John McCain in the November election. ""I take her at her word that she's going to go forward,"" said Democratic strategist Jim Duffy. ""But the math simply doesn't change. Two plus two still equals four in this race. You can't change the numbers. The question becomes at what point is she willing to decide to concede."" Her defeat in North Carolina was particularly biting because she has done some of her best campaigning in the last few weeks and because her politically astute husband, former President Bill Clinton, had swept small towns across the state trying to drum up support for his wife. Clinton portrayed her slender win in Indiana as a come-from-behind victory although polls had shown her leading ahead of the vote. Before all the votes were counted, she vowed ""full speed on to the White House."" But she made some conciliatory noises. ""I can assure you as I have said on many occasions, that no matter what happens, I will work for the nominee of the Democratic Party ... and I know that Senator Obama feels the same way,"" she said. Obama's North Carolina victory and strong showing in Indiana was a sign he had survived the furor over racially charged rhetoric from his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, although race still simmers in the contest. Voters surveyed in exit polls reported that the Wright issue was a major factor for them. White working-class voters went heavily for Clinton, while Obama won overwhelming black support. UPHILLL STRUGGLE The 60-year-old Clinton is left with an uphill task. She must win the lion's share of nominating delegates from the remaining contests -- West Virginia on May 13, Kentucky and Oregon on May 20, Puerto Rico on June 1, and Montana and South Dakota on June 3. At the same time, she must convince enough of the Democrats' ""superdelegates,"" those party officials who can vote for whomever they want, that she is a more electable Democrat and they should side with her. That effort was already well under way. Top Clinton adviser Harold Ickes was quoted as telling Time Magazine's The Page on Tuesday that questions still remained about Obama. ""We don't know enough about Senator Obama yet. We don't need an 'October surprise.' And (the chance of) an 'October surprise' with Hillary is remote,"" he said. Plus, Clinton must convince the Democrats to seat delegates from Florida and Michigan, whose votes she won earlier in the race but have not been recognized because the voting contests were held before national Democratic Party rules allowed. ""I think it's most likely that Obama wins,"" said Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta. ""I can't see a way that she wins the nomination without really tearing up the party."" Democratic strategist Liz Chadderdon said the close contest needs to end long before the Democrats' nominating convention in Denver in August because a convention battle would be damaging and could help the Republicans. ""The truth is that the way this ends is going to determine how we end in November,"" she said. ""And the loser must lose gracefully. We must come together."""

Veteran defender Hasan Al Mamun will lead the young side while Abu Yousuf will be coach-cum-manager in the three nations meet. It was learnt that the decision was made on April 30, the day the newly elected executive committee of the Bangladesh Football Federation took over charge. BFF president Kazi Salahuddin had named coach Yousuf as the manager of the tour, and set aside 'controversial' member Amirul Islam Babu from doing the managerial job of the national team. Team doctor Shahinur Rahman Parvez was also asked to assist the coach in the managerial task. BFF vice president Badal Roy and member Hasanuzzaman Khan Bablu saw off the players at the airport. Coach Yousuf said their target was to finish top among three teams. ""You never achieve the goal until you set a target for the boys and force them to do it and we are certainly going to qualify for the finals of the Challenge Cup,"" Yousuf told reporters at the Zia International Airport Friday. It was scheduled to be a four nations meet, but Laos at the eleven hour, pulled out of the qualifiers, and Bangladesh will begin their campaign taking on Afghanistan on May 5 at the Central Stadium of the Kyrgyz capital. Bangladesh, who hosted the inaugural AFC Challenge Cup in 2006, will face hosts Kyrgyzstan on May 9. ""If the boys can show their potential on the day, then we will achieve success,"" said captain Hasan Al Mamun. The national footballers geared up at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan for one month  three weeks for fitness training and one week for practice with ball, but they only played a warm-up match against the Bangladesh Army team. ""We might have lack of playing warm-up matches, but I believe we will play good football,"" striker Jahid Hasan Emily said, ""I won't miss the target if I get proper feeds from the midfielders."" Meanwhile, three champions from Group B, C and D will join direct qualifiers North Korea, Myanmar, Turkmenistan, hosts India and Group A champions Sri Lanka in the 8-team finals, scheduled for July 30 to August 10 at Gachibowli Stadium, Hyderabad in India. Coach Yousuf has also sketched a probable playing eleven. They are goalie Aminul Haq, defenders Hasan Al Mamun, Wali Faisal, Ranaji Kanta Barmon, Mofazzel Hossain Saikat, midfielders Arup Kumar Baidya, Arman Aziz, Jahed Parvez, Mamunul Islam Mamun, strikers Mehdi Hasan Ujjal and Jahid Hasan Emily. Apart from these players, Biplob Bhattacharya, Ariful Islam, Ashiqul Islam Mishu, Enamul Haq Sharif, Faisal Mahmud and M Maruf Ahmed are other members on the 18-member squad."
en.15.65.45.2008.5.6,"Myanmar says cyclone death toll 15,000 and set to rise","Yangon, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 15,000 people were killed in the Myanmar cyclone and the toll was likely to rise as officials made contact with the worst-hit areas, the military government's foreign minister said on Tuesday. Foreign Minister Nyan Win said on state television that 10,000 people had died in just one town, Bogalay, as he gave the first detailed account of what is emerging as the worst cyclone to hit Asia since 1991, when 143,000 people were killed in Bangladesh. ""In Irrawaddy Division the death toll amounts to more than 10,000,"" he said in a state television broadcast, in which he also said the military government welcomed outside assistance, an unprecedented green light to governments and aid agencies who want to help with the recovery. ""The missing is about 3,000. In Bogalay, the death toll is about 10,000,"" the minister said in the broadcast monitored outside of the Southeast Asian country. The United Nations and the former Burma's neighbors are scrambling to deliver food, clean water and shelter to survivors after the junta, the latest face of 46 years of unbroken military rule, gave them permission. The total left homeless by the 190 km (120 miles) per hour winds and 12 foot (3.5 meter) storm surge is in the several hundred thousands, United Nations aid officials say, and could run into the millions. In Yangon, a city of 5 million, people were queuing up for bottled water and there was still no electricity four days after the vicious Cyclone Nargis struck the delta, rice bowl of the country of 53 million people. ""Generators are selling very well under the generals,"" said one man waiting outside a shop, reflecting some of the resentment on the streets to what many described as a slow warning and response to the cyclone's 190 km (120 miles) per hour winds. Very few soldiers were seen clearing debris and trees, except at major intersections, residents in the former capital said. Monks and residents, using what tools they had, cut trees. ""The regime has lost a golden opportunity to send the soldiers as soon as the storm stopped to win the heart and soul of people,"" said a retired civil servant. GENERALS ACCEPT AID The last major storm to ravage Asia was Cyclone Sidr, which killed 3,300 people in Bangladesh last November. The scale of the disaster drew a rare acceptance of outside help from the diplomatically isolated generals, who spurned such approaches in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The U.S. Embassy in Myanmar authorized the release of $250,000 in immediate emergency aid, and US first lady Laura Bush, a critic of the junta, promised more would be forthcoming. However, she urged Myanmar's military rulers to first accept a US disaster response team that so far has been kept out, saying it would clear the way for broader aid. The secretive junta has moved even further into the shadows in the last six months due to widespread outrage at its bloody crackdown on protests led by Buddhist monks in September. After getting a ""careful green light"" from the government, the United Nations said it was pulling out all the stops to send in emergency aid such as food, clean water, blankets and plastic sheeting. ""The UN will begin preparing assistance now to be delivered and transported to Myanmar as quickly as possible,"" World Food Programme (WFP) spokesman Paul Risley said. A Thai military plane carrying 9 metric tons of food is due to leave Bangkok later on Tuesday, the first outside aid package. Aid agency World Vision said it had been granted special visas to send in personnel to back up the 600 staff in the country. ""This is massive. It is not necessarily quite tsunami level, but in terms of impact of millions displaced, thousands dead, it is just terrible,"" World Vision Australia head Tim Costello told Reuters. ""Organizations like ours have been given permission, which is pretty unprecedented, to fly people in. This shows how grave it is in the Burmese government's mind,"" he said"

en.15.65.51.2008.5.4,Zimbabwe opposition mulls conditions for run-off,"Harare, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's main opposition party is discussing possible conditions for its leader Morgan Tsvangirai to contest a run-off election against President Robert Mugabe, a senior MDC official said on Sunday. The Movement for Democratic Change has not yet decided whether to contest the second round, rejecting official results of the March 29 election showing the former union leader won with less than the outright majority he needed to defeat Mugabe. But if Tsvangirai does not stand, it would automatically hand victory to Mugabe, accused by opponents of ruining Zimbabwe's once prosperous economy during his 28 years in power. The MDC official said party leaders were hammering out conditions they would demand for Tsvangirai's participation in a second round -- including a strong international observer mission and the speedy release of results. The opposition says the month-long delay in announcing the last result allowed the outcome to be rigged. The official result showed Tsvangirai won 47.9 percent of the vote to Mugabe's 43.2 percent. One resolution being discussed by the MDC's national executive made clear a run-off was inevitable. It called on election officials to release the results of a second round within 48 hours and for Mugabe to concede defeat if he lost, the MDC official said. He did not want to give his name. The opposition, which has accused Mugabe's ZANU-PF party of rigging previous elections, is also likely to demand an end to post-election violence it blames on Mugabe supporters. ""International supervision should be mandatory, the whole AU (African Union) should be allowed in. Over and above that there has to be an end to politically motivated violence,"" said the official, who attended a high-level MDC meeting on Saturday. PRESSURE Tsvangirai has not endorsed the proposals, and pressure is building on the MDC leader to announce his intentions. Mugabe has accepted the official results, and ZANU-PF has announced that the 84-year-old ruler will be its candidate on the second ballot. According to electoral laws the run-off should normally be held within 21 days of the result, which was announced on Friday, but the electoral commission can extend the period. Political observers said a 40-day wait was likely. On paper, Tsvangirai would be well placed to win given his first round victory and the expected support of Simba Makoni, a ruling party defector who came third in the initial vote. But there are fears the run-off campaign could see an escalation of political violence in a country where millions are struggling to survive because of a deep economic crisis marked by chronic food and fuel shortages, rising malnutrition and hyperinflation. The opposition, Western governments and human rights groups have accused Mugabe of unleashing militias to scare Zimbabweans into backing him in the run-off. The government denies the allegation and says the MDC is behind political violence. The opposition says at least 20 of its supporters have been killed and more than 1,000 homes burnt or destroyed by ZANU-PF militia since the elections. The United States and former colonial power Britain have questioned the credibility of the first-round results and raised concerns about the legitimacy of another round of voting. Mugabe denounces his opponents as puppets of the West. The United States and other nations have pledged billions of dollars in reconstruction aid if Mugabe is removed from power."
en.15.65.365.2008.5.6,Obama and Clinton clash on gas tax before big votes,"Greenville, North Carolina,May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton renewed their battle over gas tax relief on Monday in a late push for support on the eve of critical presidential showdowns in North Carolina and Indiana. The candidates, embroiled in a grueling nominating struggle that has split the party, wooed working-class voters and launched new television advertisements attacking each other ahead of Tuesday's votes. Clinton hit Obama for opposing her proposal to lift the federal gasoline tax for the summer, which he says is political pandering. She launched a television ad in both states accusing Obama of attacking her plan ""because he doesn't have one."" Clinton says her support for a summer-long suspension of the gasoline tax would help Americans struggling with record gas prices in a faltering economy. ""Sen. Obama doesn't want to do anything,"" Clinton, a New York senator, told a rally at a community college in Greenville, North Carolina. ""You don't hire a president to make speeches. You hire a president to solve problems."" Obama, an Illinois senator, responded with his own advertisement saying Clinton offered ""more of the same old negative politics."" He said the gas tax holiday was a dishonest approach to a real problem. ""There is not a single economist or editorial that I've read that says that this is a good idea, and the reason is, is because it's not being honest with the American people,"" Obama said on NBC's ""Today"" show. ""People don't need symbolic relief, they need real relief."" Indiana and North Carolina, with a combined 187 delegates to the August nominating convention at stake, are the biggest prizes remaining in the state-by-state Democratic race. There will then be only six contests left. Obama leads Clinton in the race for the 2,025 delegates needed to win the nomination to face Republican John McCain in November's presidential election. Voting in the Tuesday elections ends in Indiana at 7 p.m. EDT and in North Carolina at 7:30 p.m. EDT, with results expected soon after. STATE-BY-STATE BATTLE Wins for Obama in both states would effectively end Clinton's chances of overtaking him in either delegates or popular votes cast in the state-by-state battle. But a sweep of the two states by Clinton would fan doubts about Obama's electability and prolong a rough patch where he has been on the defensive over a big loss in Pennsylvania, his relationship with his controversial former pastor the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and other issues. Obama told supporters in Durham, North Carolina, his recent troubles ""basically exhaust my problems"" and he had moved on. He attributed the difficulties to his position as the front-runner in the race. ""Sen. Clinton, despite what she says about being vetted, she hasn't gone through what I've been going through over the last couple of months because she's not the front-runner,"" he said. Obama leads in polls in North Carolina, although his once double-digit advantage over Clinton has shrunk to single digits. The two are running close in Indiana, where most polls show Clinton with a slight lead. Neither candidate will win enough delegates before the voting ends on June 3 to clinch the nomination, leaving the decision to nearly 800 superdelegates -- elected officials and party insiders -- who are free to back any candidate. A split decision on Tuesday would leave the race largely unchanged, with the candidates trying to convince superdelegates they would be the best Democrat to take on McCain. McCain, speaking to reporters in Phoenix, launched a Spanish language Web site to mark the Mexican Cinco de Mayo festival on Monday and said Republicans could win back the support of Hispanics. Hispanics, a fast-growing voting bloc in many battleground states, have moved away from Republicans in the last year after a bruising battle over immigration and the treatment of illegal aliens. McCain lost some conservative support during the immigration debate by backing a path to citizenship for some of the country's 12 million illegal immigrants. He later said Congress should focus on border security first. ""I believe that the majority of Hispanics share our view that the border must be secured and must be secured first,"" the Arizona senator said. ""But they also want us to have an attitude, which I think most Americans do, that these are God's children and they must be taken care of, that the issue must be addressed in a humane and compassionate fashion."
en.15.65.74.2008.5.6,"China's Hu urges close Japan ties, offers two pandas","TOKYO, Tue May 6,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese President Hu Jintao lauded closer cooperation with Japan -- and offered a pair of pandas as a friendly gesture -- after arriving on Tuesday for a state visit intended to nurture trust between the wary Asian powers. The state visit, the second ever by a top Chinese leader, comes as China seeks to soothe international concern over Tibetan unrest, which has threatened to mar Beijing's Olympic Games in August. Hu was greeted at the airport by senior Japanese officials and flag-waving well-wishers, mostly Chinese, but in the centre of the capital, more than 1,000 protesters marched peacefully chanting ""Human rights for Tibet"". Trucks carrying right-wing activists roamed the city blaring anti-China slogans and Japan's national anthem. Some 7,000 police were deployed amid concern over protests by the activists, who see China as a threat, but there were no reports of scuffles. China wants to promote an image as a friendly neighbor after years of feuding over Japan's handling of its wartime aggression. Hu, who has stressed forward-looking goals for his five days of summitry and ceremony, said stable and friendly ties were good for both countries, whose economies are increasingly intertwined. ""Relations between the two countries now have new opportunities for further development,"" he said in a written statement upon arrival in Tokyo. ""I hope through this visit to increase mutual trust and strengthen friendship."" In a gesture that might help woo a skeptical Japanese public, Hu offered to give Japan two pandas for research purposes, Japan's foreign ministry said in a statement, following the recent death of popular Ling Ling panda at a Tokyo zoo. He made the offer during an informal dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda at a Tokyo restaurant with historical links to Sun Yat-sen, considered the ""father"" of modern China. OPPORTUNITIES, ANXIETIES China replaced the United States as Japan's top trade partner last year, with two-way trade worth $236.6 billion, up 12 percent from 2006. ""As two important powers, if China and Japan can coordinate and cooperate more, and together promote regional economic integration and respond together to international financial, energy, environmental and a series of other challenges, that would be an excellent supplement to our two countries overall trade and economic relations,"" Chinese ambassador to Japan Cui Tiankai said in a recent interview on Chinese state TV. But Beijing's expanding diplomatic and military reach has also stirred anxieties in Japan over disputed energy resources, military power and the safety standards of Chinese exports. ""Although the iceberg between China and Japan has melted, fully warming relations require further efforts from both sides,"" a commentator wrote in China's People's Daily. The political climax of Hu's visit is set to be a summit on Wednesday with Fukuda, when they hope to unveil a blueprint for managing future ties. Beijing and Tokyo are keen to avoid a rerun of former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan a decade ago, which left a chill after he delivered pointed lectures on Japan's 1931-1945 invasion and occupation of China. Sino-Japanese ties chilled during Junichiro Koizumi's 2001-2006 term as prime minister over his visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni war shrine, but tensions have eased since then. Japanese media reports said that touchy references in the joint document to Taiwan, human rights, and Japan's hopes for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council were still under negotiation. The two countries are also quarrelling over the rights to gas beds beneath the East China Sea, while a row over Chinese-made dumplings laced with pesticide that made several people sick has become for some a symbol of Japanese alarm at China's rise. GOODWILL, NOT BREAKTHROUGHS? Japan wants greater transparency about China's surging defense spending, set at 418 billion yuan ($60 billion) for 2008, up 17.6 percent on 2007 and outstripping Japan's defense budget. Foreign critics say China's real military budget is much higher. Tokyo wants Chinese backing for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an issue that in 2005 fuelled anti-Japanese protests in China, where there is deep rancor over Japan's harsh wartime occupation of much of the country. China has pressed Japan to spell out again its stance on Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing says must accept reunification. Tokyo has said it supports ""one China"" that includes Taiwan, which was a Japanese colony for fifty years until 1945 and keeps close ties to Japan. Few expect big breakthroughs on specific disputes, but the two sides are keen to stress forward-looking goodwill and are to issue a joint document on fighting climate change, a key topic for Japan as host of the July G8 summit. Hu will speak to Japanese students at Tokyo's Waseda University and may unwind a bit by playing ping-pong with Fukuda. ($1=6.988 Yuan"

The India Premier League (IPL) was launched last month involving several high-profile players and has taken the cricket world by storm with the England board also planning their own league. ""Following the changing cricket landscape after the explosion of Twenty20 cricket, the committee will discuss international cricket as the pinnacle of the game, the impact of Twenty20 cricket on other formats of the game and the impact of domestic leagues on the international game,"" an ICC statement said. The lure of the IPL has been such that several Australia and New Zealand players put the games ahead of country commitments, including tours of West Indies and England respectively. The ICC are also facing calls to carve a window in their Future Tours Programme for the league. The Dubai meeting will also finalise details of this year's ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan and the 2009 Twenty20 World Cup in England, as well as trialing an umpires' decision review system"

Microsoft's board of directors is still weighing whether to adopt a hostile approach and nominate a proxy slate of directors to replace Yahoo's board, sweeten its cash-and-stock offer for Yahoo, or possibly walk away from the deal, the Journal said. A Microsoft spokesman was not available for comment. A Microsoft-imposed deadline for Yahoo to start talks on a final deal or face a proxy battle passed last Saturday. An announcement from Microsoft is expected later this week, the report said. Microsoft, according to the report, has indicated it would be willing to raise its bid to as much as $33 per share but such an offer may still fall short of the $35 to $37 per share that Yahoo's major shareholders are looking for. Meanwhile, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, who is also a member of the board, has appeared ready in recent days to abandon the offer since Yahoo and its major shareholders want significantly more money, according to the Journal. Ballmer had said last week that Microsoft was considering walking away from the deal. But most Wall Street analysts dismiss this as a hardball negotiating tactic rather than a real threat to end its two-year-long pursuit of a deal. The value of Microsoft's offer, originally valued at $44.6 billion at $31 a share, has fallen to $29.06 a share due to a drop in the value of Microsoft's stock"
en.15.65.17.2008.5.3,Law adviser stresses changes to Press Council Act,"Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff Saturday stressed the reinforcement of Bangladesh Press Council in an effort to protect the rights of the media. ""The 1974 Press Council Act should be modified so that the council can discharge its responsibilities properly,"" the adviser said in his speech to a seminar at the National Press Club. Bangladesh Press Council was established to preserve the freedom of the press and improve the standards of newspapers and news agencies in the country. Critics say the council has never been able to play an effective role. The adviser said: ""The media work as a mouthpiece for society that reflects people's desires and expectations. Sometimes newspapers publish confusing reports, which hurts people's democratic rights."" ""Journalists should be responsible and careful enough to keep up the freedom of the press,"" the adviser said. Ariff asked journalists to arrange public hearings at grassroots level. ""That will help us know whether people's expectations are reflected properly,"" he said. Dr Mizanur Rahman Shelly, founding chairman of the Centre for Development Research, read out the keynote paper at the seminar. Dr Shelly also suggested the Press Council Act, made in 1974, should be reformed and modified. A number of proposals raised in the keynote paper include recruiting the chairman and members of the Press Council through parliament, balance in service terms of the chairman and members and increasing the number of members. It also recommended publishing interim reports alongside annual reports on the activities of the Press Council. Dr Shelly said: ""It has been three decades since the formulation of the Press Council. The law should be modified."" ""The freedom of the press does not refer to indiscipline and misuse of power. The rights of the people cannot be ensured unless the freedom of the media is ensured,"" he said. Press Council chairman Justice Kazi Ebadul Haque said: ""The Press Council cannot fulfill the expectations of journalists and people due to legal barriers, although the organisation has been running its activities over the two decades."" ""Many doubt whether the organisation is being able to play its role properly in the backdrop of socio-economical and political changes,"" Haque said. He stressed the expansion of the jurisdiction of the Press Council to ensure the code of conduct for journalists. bdnew"
en.15.65.395.2008.5.1,"Turn-ons, turn-offs, desire varies widely among men","NEW YORK, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Health) - Men aren't all from Mars when it comes to their sexuality, a new study from Kinsey Institute researchers shows. Among the revelations from their focus groups in which men talked about what influenced their sexual desire and arousal: one man's turn-on is often another's turn-off; an erection doesn't always signal arousal; and not every guy wants to jump into bed at the drop of a hat. ""We're probably from a whole bunch of different planets,"" Dr. Erick Janssen, an associate scientist at the Bloomington, Indiana-based institute and one of the study's authors, told Reuters Health. ""We don't tend to -- from a research perspective -- sit down a lot with men or groups of men and talk about such intimate topics, such as what influences...sexual desire and arousal and the topic or the question of where in all of this the penis comes in,"" he added. ""This is one of the studies that attempted to do that."" Janssen and his team set up six focus groups in which 50 men between the ages of 18 and 70, most of whom were white and heterosexual, talked about what aroused them sexually and what enhanced or inhibited their arousal. The findings are published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior. Men reported getting erections without necessarily being aroused, while some men, especially older men, said they might become aroused without having an erection. Some used masturbation as a way to ""fix"" it ""when something just feels off,"" or as a ""great way"" to get out of a funk. Many men said feeling confident and good about themselves often led to feeling sexually aroused (while ""feeling scruffy"" had the opposite effect). And for many men, a self-confident partner was also more desirable than one who didn't feel good about herself. In addition to a nice body and a pretty face, many men found intelligence ""really attractive"" and ""a big turn on."" Mood and feeling emotionally connected also influenced arousal for men, while a woman's scent was key for some men, but not others. However, an ""overwhelming majority"" said that being outdoors, for example on a camping trip or having a picnic, boosted their sexual desire and arousal. Taken together, the findings provide a much more nuanced picture of men's sexuality than is promoted by men's magazines, Janssen pointed out. ""There's huge variability among men in how easily they're turned on or turned off, how easily they experience sexual desire and arousal,"" he explained. ""The differences among men and the differences among women are much larger than the average difference between the sexes in almost anything sexual."" In fact, the researcher added, as many as 30 percent of women may be more easily sexually aroused than most men. ""This study's challenging the idea that men are simple,"" he said.

en.15.65.440.2008.5.6,Asia calls for funding to fight food shock,"Madrid, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Over a billion Asians may sink back into extreme poverty without extra aid to counter soaring food prices, the region's development bank warned on Monday as a battle brewed over who would fund its spending. The call for cash to secure food supplies for Asia -- home to two thirds of the world's poor -- was accompanied by debate on whether developing countries or rapidly expanding nations like China and India should foot the bill. There was also tension over who was responsible for a more than 40 percent rise in global food prices in the year to March that has triggered violent riots in Africa and Asia. ""The global fight against poverty will be won or lost in our region,"" Asian Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda said in a keynote speech to delegates at the bank's annual meeting. Asia risks rising social tension as a doubling of wheat and rice prices in the last year slams poor families who spend more than half their income on food, Japan's finance minister warned. With grain stocks at their lowest levels in decades, turmoil in global financial markets and an uncertain outlook for the world economy, Kuroda made a plea for ""money and ideas"" to boost development and rescue millions from hunger and malnutrition. ""The absence of such measures could seriously undermine the global fight against poverty and erode the gains of the past decades,"" he said. POOR LEFT TO HELP POOR? The call for action was accompanied by requests to rapidly accelerate the ADB's investment programme, particularly its core portfolio of infrastructure project lending, funded by loans linked to market interest rates. The 67 economies which fund the ADB -- 48 from the Asia Pacific region -- broadly agree that solving the food crisis will require short term emergency finance as well as long term loans and technical support to raise agricultural productivity. Sources inside the ADB say to meet soaring demand for assistance, the Bank must substantially increase its capital base from its current $56 billion. If it doesn't, the ADB's core non-concessional lending activity -- some $8.2 billion of the $10.1 billion it invested in total in 2007 -- risks being slashed. The United States, the ADB's second largest donor, was non-committal when asked about the need to increase funding. Washington has criticised the ADB for failing to focus lending on the very poor, its lack of accountability and investing too heavily in Asia's middle-income economies. ""We don't have analytical justification as to whether capital increase is necessary or not,"" Clay Lowery, US Assistant Secretary of International Affairs at the Department of Treasury, told Reuters. India said the ADB urgently needed extra funds if it was to cut poverty among the 1.5 billion people in Asia-Pacific living on less than $2 a day -- a number three times the population of Europe. ""We seem to moving into an era where increasingly poor countries will be asked to help out their poor brethren,"" said Indian Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram. Asian officials say the United States would like countries like China and India to provide a bigger chunk of ADB funding, given they are some of the world's fastest growing economies. Asian countries at the ADB meeting have blamed one another for exacerbating price inflation by resorting to export restrictions, subsidies and food imports. Tensions over the food crisis bubbled to the surface in India on Monday after a remark by US President George W Bush that the Asian country's growing middle class is partly responsible for rising prices after demanding better nutrition. Unease with the ADB's lending activities was evident in the Philippines capital Manila, the Bank's headquarters, where around two dozen people demonstrated against its role in privatisation deals and blamed the lender for failing to do more to combat rising food prices. ""In its 41 years of existence, the ADB has brought very little development to poor countries in the region, but left them heavily indebted,"" Eman Hizon, one of the protesters, told Reuters"
en.15.65.455.2008.5.1,United's defence lay foundations for semi-final victory,"MANCHESTER, England, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United's outstanding defensive display in their Champions League semi-final against Barcelona on Tuesday was as much a key element in their victory as Paul Scholes' stunning match-winner. The midfielder's 25-metre thunderbolt in the 14th minute was all that separated the sides after 180 minutes of a pulsating two-legged tie and secured the home side a third appearance in the final after previous victories in 1968 and 1999. However, United's delirious supporters, who created an unforgettable atmosphere inside Old Trafford, should be still thanking the side's defenders when they book their tickets to Moscow for the May 21 final. England mainstay Rio Ferdinand was in imperious form, winning tackle after tackle, and Wes Brown was so committed to stopping everything, he accidentally kicked Manchester Untied goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar in the head. Patrice Evra, one of the central figures in the fracas with the Stamford Bridge groundsmen after United's loss at Chelsea on Saturday, was given a tough night by Lionel Messi, but came out on top as the Argentine failed to score or create a goal. Owen Hargreaves, playing at right back, rarely put a foot wrong against Andres Iniesta, and even when Barcelona did get a strike on goal, Van der Sar stopped everything that came his way. United boss Alex Ferguson was forced into a defensive reshuffle after Nemanja Vidic failed to recover from a facial injury suffered against Chelsea, but the manager said that did not cause him too much concern. ""Wes Brown is a natural defender and slotted into that position, so I was not too worried about that,"" Ferguson told reporters. CLEAN SHEETS United's defence did not concede a goal for the 30th time in 53 matches this seasonand they have also kept a clean sheet for five successive Champions League games. Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard however, was not totally enthralled by United's performance. ""I think that the level of the English teams is very high. If it weren't for the fact that two teams had to play each other (Arsenal and Liverpool in the quarter-final) we could easily have seen all four teams in the semi-final. ""They are very difficult to beat, very strong and very disciplined."" ""But when they play in European games it's not the same (as in the domestic league). They all get behind the ball, they were very well organised and play with counter attacks. ""It's a pity because the English teams have a lot more to give on the pitch to the public. ""It's strange to see English teams defending, defending and defending with their lives and trying to win with the counter attack. ""I think they can do a lot more. They have their own spirit their own culture but you don't see it in European football."" Of more immediate concern to Rijkaard though is his own future and staying in his job after two seasons without a trophy since Barcelona won the European Cup in 2006. His attack also let him down. Although Messi was the best player on the field, Barca failed to convert any of the chances he created and their failure in attack, coupled with United's resolute defending, decided the game. United will face the winners of Wednesday's second semi-final between Liverpool and Chelsea in the Champions League's first all-English final. The sides drew 1-1 at Anfield last Tuesday"

Calvo Sotelo had to drop to the floor of parliament along with other deputies on February 23 1981, when a Guardia Civil lieutenant colonel brandished a pistol in the air, ending a session supposed to appoint the new prime minister. The coup quickly collapsed after a television broadcast from the king, and Calvo Sotelo was eventually named prime minister as planned, governing until his centrist UCD was defeated in elections by the Socialist Party in late 1982. Regarded as one of the prominent figures in Spain's transition to a modern democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, Calvo Sotelo is remembered for taking Spain into NATO. A member of a prominent conservative family, he had eight children and lived in Madrid. He died of a heart attack, his son, also called Leopoldo, said."

With four matches left Bayern have 66 points, 12 more than Bremen and Schalke. Even if the two second-placed teams triumph, Bremen against Energie Cottbus and Schalke against Hanover 96, Bayern will need only a point from Sunday's match at VfL Wolfsburg to capture their 21st German championship. ""You can already congratulate us on the title,"" manager Uli Hoeness told the club's Web site (www.fcbayern.de) after Sunday's 4-1 victory over champions VfB Stuttgart.

en.15.65.60.2008.5.2,Bush proposes $770 million for world food crisis,"WASHINGTON, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W Bush called for $770 million in new US food aid donations and other measures on Thursday as Washington seeks to stave off a food crisis threatening to envelop the developing world. Bush, expressing concern as skyrocketing world food prices intensify unrest in poor countries from Haiti to Burkina Faso, promised the United States would take a lead in fighting the hunger now gripping a greater swath of the developing world. ""With the new international funding I'm announcing today, we're sending a clear message to the world that America will lead the fight against hunger for years to come,"" Bush said. Surging prices for wheat, rice and other staples, along with record-high fuel prices, have eaten into aid budgets in the United States, the world's largest food aid donor. ""I think more needs to be done. And so today I'm asking Congress to provide an additional $770 million to support food aid and development programs,"" Bush told reporters at the White House as he unveiled a supplemental budget request for fiscal 2009 that would require congressional approval. Administration officials said the $770 million would include $395 million in emergency food aid, $225 million for food vouchers, seeds, or aid purchases in the developing world, and $150 million for development work aimed at food security. That will help ""improve the ability of the developing world to feed itself,"" said Stephen McMillin, a top budget official. If approved by Congress, the funds would become available on October 1, and would bring overall support for global food security to $2.66 billion for 2009. The announcement comes several weeks after Bush approved the release of 250,000 tonnes of wheat from an emergency crop trust, a step the United States had not taken since 2005. It reflects the mounting concern among world leaders about protests, strikes and riots that have erupted in the wake of dramatically higher prices, which affect the poor the most. ""The next few weeks are critical for addressing the food crisis. For 2 billion people, high food prices are now a matter of daily struggle, sacrifice, and ... even survival,"" World Bank President Robert Zoellick said this week. 'WIDE-SCALE HUMAN SUFFERING' Global food prices jumped an annual 43 percent to March 2008, the White House said. The trend is typically blamed on a confluence of factors, including rising food consumption in emerging economies like India and China and adverse weather. The growing use of food crops to make biofuels like ethanol is also seen as a driver, although the administration argues the fuels only account for a small share of the price spike. Josette Sheeran, who heads the United Nations food aid agency, asked Congress to approve the funds urgently to help prevent ""wide-scale human suffering."" Some aid groups and US lawmakers are clamoring for more assistance immediately.

""The urgency of hunger and the urgency of instability are not being confronted by the White House on this."" The administration has already requested supplemental food aid funding, a perennial addition to annual budget funds, of $350 million for fiscal 2008, but some are pushing for a figure at least $200 million higher. The United States typically provides about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in food aid each year through the US Agency for International Development. ""As a humanitarian organization interested in saving lives, we are not sure these resources equip us to meet the needs now,"" said Catholic Relief Services, an aid group.

en.15.65.495.2008.5.2,Fiji deports Murdoch newspaper publisher,"Suva, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fiji's military government deported the Australian publisher of Rupert Murdoch's Fiji Times newspaper on Friday, after declaring him a threat to national security. The move is the latest crackdown on the media in Fiji since military commander Frank Bainimarama seized power in a bloodless coup in late 2006, and comes amid growing international criticism of the slow progress in returning the island chain to democracy. Fiji Times publisher Evan Hannah was escorted by a soldier onto a Korean Airline flight to Seoul, despite a court order that he attend an appeal hearing against the deportation order issued on Thursday, the newspaper said. Fiji Times Editor Netani Rika said Fijian journalists have been harassed by the government for 18 months and that the latest deportation was part of a campaign to silence media criticism. ""Our people have been under constant threat and intimidation for the last 18 months. Mr. Hannah is not the first journalist to be removed from his home,"" Rika told Australian radio. ""All I can think of right now, that it is an attempt to intimidate the media, yes,"" he said. The deportation comes after another Australian, Russell Hunter, publisher of the rival Fiji Sun newspaper, was deported in February for criticizing Bainimarama's government. ""ANOTHER SORRY MILESTONE"" The U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, released in March, said Fiji's security forces and police arbitrarily detained and sometimes abused individuals, resulting in three deaths in 2007. ""The night-time abduction of Fiji Times publisher Evan Hannah marks yet another sorry milestone on the interim government's road to disgrace,"" said the Fiji Sun editorial on Friday. ""Make no mistake, these deportations are the precursors to stringent and punitive media controls ...,"" it said. ""This will give the interim government what it has long craved: total control over what the people of Fiji are permitted to know and even discuss publicly. It will give the regime the power to act in secret."" Bainimarama has promised to hold free and fair elections by early 2009, but South Pacific foreign ministers said in March that more work was needed to meet the election timetable. Murdoch's Australian publishing arm, News Ltd, has condemned Hannah's deportation as the latest threat to press freedom in Fiji. The Fiji Times' editor said his newspaper had always been a watchdog on government policies regardless of who was in power and would not soften its stance despite the latest deportation. ""We've been a strong critic of, I wouldn't say government, but of government policies dating back more than 20 years,"" Rika said. ""I think, yes we are recognized ... as the unofficial opposition in the country."" ""For us at the Fiji Times, it just means that we now know that the government will not take dissenting views lightly, but it also means that we have an even more important role to play to ensure that the views of all people in this country are made known, including the views of the government."""
en.15.65.422.2008.5.6,Guardiola to be named Barcelona coach,"MADRID, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former club captain Pep Guardiola will replace Frank Rijkaard as Barcelona coach at the end of the season, Spanish media reported on Tuesday. Newspapers said that Barcelona's delegate commission, which includes club president Joan Laporta and sporting director Txiki Begiristain, had met on Monday and recommended that Guardiola should replace Rijkaard as first team coach. Barcelona-based daily Sport said the decision would be ratified by the rest of the board and made official at the end of the season. The club has said it will not comment on possible changes until the season is over. Rijkaard, whose contract runs to 2009, has denied reports he will step down as coach in the wake of the team's failure to win any silverware over the past two seasons. Local-born Guardiola made his name at Barcelona as a cultured midfielder in the early 1990s when Johan Cruyff was manager. He quickly established himself as a favourite at the Nou Camp and became one of the key players in Cruyff's so-called ""Dream team"" which won four consecutive league titles between 1991 and 1994 and the European Cup in 1992. He was part of the Spain side that won the gold medal in the Barcelona Olympics and won 47 caps for the senior national team. Guardiola left Barcelona in 2001 to join Serie A side Brescia but his career in Italy was disrupted when he tested positive for nandrolone in November 2001. He served a four-month ban but strenuously denied any offence and went through the courts to clear his name, finally winning his case in October last year. After spells in Qatar and Mexico, Guardiola announced his retirement as a player in Nov. 2006. He was appointed coach of Barcelona's B side last June"

Sohul said the draft of the electoral reforms law would be sent to the law ministry soon. On political parties' reaction to the redrawing of parliament constituencies, Sohul said: ""Politicians may have a say.

There are constitutional and legal obligations to redraw the borders of parliamentary seats, Sohul said. He said there was no scope to file a case over the redrawing of constituencies.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei did not explicitly mention Iran's nuclear activities, which Western powers suspect are aimed at making bombs, but Iranian officials have repeatedly ruled out halting the program which they say is a national right. ""We will continue with our path with power and we will not allow the arrogant ones to step on the right of this nation,"" Khamenei said in a speech, referring to Iran's Western foes. ""Threatening the Iranian nation will not (make it) retreat,"" he said during a visit to the southern province of Fars, state television reported. ""No threat can persuade the Iranian nation to stop its path."" World powers met in London on Friday and said they would offer new incentives to encourage Iran to halt nuclear work. Iran, which says its nuclear program is a peaceful drive to generate electricity, refused the last such offer made in 2006.

en.15.65.137.2008.5.5,Yahoo may face lawsuit flood after talks collapse,"NEW YORK, May 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Yahoo Inc likely faces a flood of shareholder lawsuits for rejecting a $47.5 billion takeover bid from Microsoft Corp, even if investors find holding the company responsible to be an uphill battle. Microsoft pulled its sweetened $33-per-share offer on Saturday because the Internet company was holding out for $37 per share, even though Microsoft's price was more than 70 percent above where Yahoo shares were trading before the takeover battle started more than three months ago. ""I think it's pretty hard for the Yahoo board to turn down $33 when they've shown no ability to turn around their stock price,"" said Stuart Grant, managing director at Grant & Eisenhofer, a law firm that specializes in bringing investor lawsuits. ""There's going to be breach of fiduciary duty lawsuits and I must tell you they are looking pretty good right now,"" he said. Yahoo already faces at least seven lawsuits over its handling of the Microsoft offer, dating back to the company's initial refusal of a deal in February. More could be in the works, lawyers said. Mark Lebovitch, partner at Bernstein, Litowitz, Berger & Grossmann, is representing two retirement funds for municipal workers in Detroit in a class action suit against Yahoo and its board. The lawsuit argues that Yahoo explored link-ups with companies such as Google Inc and Time Warner Inc's AOL only to stave off a deal with Microsoft. It also claims these deals would destroy shareholder value. ""Essentially, threatening to destroy the company just so Microsoft can't get it is unlawful,"" Lebovitch said. He said Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang was reluctant to part with the company he co-founded. ""For all his riches it's more important to him to never sell his baby to Microsoft than to take care of his shareholders."" Nonetheless, Penn State law professor Samuel Thompson said investors would have a tough time successfully bringing these types of cases against Yahoo because Microsoft chose to withdraw its offer instead of mount a hostile takeover. Thompson said that under Delaware law, ""directors get a presumption that they've acted in good faith and in the best interest of the corporation."" He added, ""In the absence of a hostile tender offer, I don't think they have a snowball's chance in hell."" Had Microsoft started a hostile bid, plaintiffs might have had some success in removing ""poison pill"" shareholder rights plans and ""golden parachute"" severance plans that could make such a deal unwieldy. Adam Savett, who tracks securities class action suits at investor adviser RiskMetrics Group, agreed that the suits were unlikely to be successful.

The storm system is likely to intensify further and move in an east-northeasterly direction and cross Myanmar coast, according to a special weather bulletin. Under its influence, rains or thundershowers are likely in many places with isolated heavy falls over Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the next 48 hours. In Bangladesh, the weather office Thursday issued local warning signal 4 for Cox's Bazar and Chittagong and distant warning signal 2 for Mongla port. River and maritime ports took cautionary steps. Six coastal districts have been put on alert. ""Port authorities have taken extra caution and remained alert against the cyclone,"" Syed Farhad Uddin of Chittagong port told bdnews24.com. Ships at the outer anchorage have been asked to stay cautious. Small and light river vessels started anchoring on the river Karnaphuli. The authorities opened two control rooms in the port city of Chittagong.

en.15.65.43.2008.5.7,Olympic torch bearers braced for final Everest assault,"Everest Base Camp, China, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese climbers carrying the Olympic torch were camped just over a km (half a mile) from the summit of Mount Everest on Wednesday and weather conditions look good for the final assault, officials said. Bad weather has denied mountaineers the chance to take the flame to the top of Everest for nearly a fortnight, depriving China of what it had hoped would be the defining moment of the torch relay ahead of the Beijing Games in August. But calm, sunny weather over the last three days have buoyed the spirits of officials who sounded more optimistic than ever that the flame would be burning at the 8,848-metre peak before the weekend. ""I don't know exactly where the climbing torch bearers are,"" Zhang Zhijian, spokesman for the climbing team, told a media briefing. ""But before I came here today I heard they had renovated the camp at 7,790 meters. Since the weather is very nice, I think we will have good news in the coming days."" The Everest flame is separate from the main Olympic torch that arrived in mainland China on Sunday after a protest-marred international leg which embarrassed officials and sparked a wave of nationalistic fervor at home. Organizers have kept plans for the Everest ascent a closely guarded secret for fear that it may also be blighted by protests by pro-Tibet activists. Both Nepal and China have sealed off the area. Communist-ruled China has invested billions of dollars on staging the Olympics, eager to project the image of a modern and vibrant country. ALL CHINA WAITING The heavy snowfall last weekend was a setback for the project and destroyed at least some of the three camps climbers will be using from Advanced Base Camp (ABC) at 6,500 meters to the jumping off point for the summit at 8,300 meters. The preparatory work, much of which had to be redone, would significantly cut the time it took for team members to get up and, just as importantly, down the mountain, Zhang said. Zhang said the selection of the few members of the team who would summit the world's highest mountain with the flame was ongoing and that ethnicity and sex would be taken into account. ""China is a big family with 56 ethnic minorities,"" he said. ""All the Chinese people want to see the flame on top of the summit. We will take notice of the ethnic origin and sex of the climbers in equal weight with strength and fitness."" Of the 31 climbers in the team, 22 are ethnic Tibetans, eight Han Chinese and one is from the Tujia minority, which lives in a mountainous area in southwest China. Three of the climbers are women, two Tibetan and one Han. Anti-Chinese demonstrations disrupted the international stretch of the longest torch relay in Olympic history after the March 14 riots in Lhasa sparked off unrest in Tibetan areas of western China."
en.15.65.419.2008.5.6,Sudan bombs Darfur school and market,"Khartoum,May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudanese government bombs have hit a primary school and a busy market place in Darfur, killing at least 13 people, including seven children, two aid organizations said on Monday. The Sudanese army was not immediately available to comment but has repeatedly denied bombing in the area, which would be a violation of a UN Security Council resolution banning all offensive flying. The aid groups said a government Antonov plane bombed the village of Shegeg Karo in North Darfur on Sunday. If confirmed, it would be the deadliest bombing raid in Darfur in years. ""According to information gathered by the villagers of Shegeg Karo, the Antonov hovered for a long time and then bombed repeatedly,"" a joint statement from Darfur Diaries and the Darfur Peace and Development Organisation said. ""The Shegeg Karo school was hit and one classroom was destroyed. It was in session,"" it added. The youngest child to die was 5-year-old Yusuf Adam Hamid. It said two other children were seriously wounded and 30 more lightly wounded. Both organizations fund the primary school of 238 students. The groups said the market was also hit with six people reported killed and 20 shops destroyed. They said it was unclear how many people were wounded at the market place. Hundreds of women usually gather there on market day. The US special envoy to Sudan, Richard Williamson, said in Norway where he was attending a Sudan donors conference that the reports were ""extremely troubling and unacceptable."" ""It is a big concern because if past history is an indication, many of those casualties will be innocent civilians and there will be more people having to flee their homes in an area where already 2.5 million have had to flee because of violence,"" he told Reuters. Last week, a joint UN-African Union peacekeeping mission confirmed rebel reports of bombing in North Darfur in spite of government denials. CONDEMNATION On Monday UNAMID force commander Martin Luther Agwai issued a statement expressing deep concern at the ""rising toll of civilian deaths and casualties as a result of the recent bombing of villages in Darfur."" It called the reported bombing raids: ""unacceptable acts against civilians, compounding the extent of displacement, insecurity and untold human suffering."" UNAMID said it was mobilizing its helicopters to evacuate the injured. Darfur rebels said three other areas were bombed on Sunday. Ein Sirro and Jabel Medop in North Darfur and an area in West Darfur near rebel-held Jabel Moun. There were no reports of casualties. International experts estimate some 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million been driven from their homes in five years of revolt in Darfur. Khartoum blames the Western media for exaggerating the conflict and puts the death toll at 10,000. Deployment of the peacekeeping force, set to become the world's biggest, has been slow. A May 2006 peace deal was signed by one of three rebel negotiating factions. But little has been done to implement the deal while insecurity has worsened because of infighting between rebel factions. Minni Arcua Minnawi, a former rebel who signed the 2006 and became a presidential assistant, said he was suspending participation in the government for one day in protest at the lack of political will from President Omar Hassan al-Bashir's government. ""The government is not serious and not committed to the peace deal,"" said a Minnawi spokesman, al-Tayyib Khamis. Sudan is asking donor nations meeting in Norway this week for $6 billion over the next three years to help rebuild after decades of civil wars. A 2005 peace deal ended war between north and south, but did not cover Darfur"
en.15.65.179.2008.4.30,"Gold bounces from 3-month low, awaits Fed decision","LONDON, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gold bounced from a three-month low on Wednesday as investors covered short positions and bought into dips on the back of a softer dollar and higher oil prices. But analysts and traders saw limited upside for gold as the market did not want to make big bets ahead of a key decision on US interest rates by the Federal Reserve later in the day. Spot gold was at $874.80/875.80 an ounce at 1348 GMT, from $873.55/874.75 an ounce late in New York on Tuesday and up from a three-month low of $862.30 an ounce it touched earlier in the day. ""The dollar's weakening a bit, and oil prices have edged up, which seems to be helping gold bounce back,"" said analyst Eugen Weinberg at Commerzbank said. Oil edged higher near $116 a barrel ahead of US inventory data expected to show a decline in domestic gasoline stockpiles. The euro climbed to around $1.5570 after falling to $1.5518 due to stronger than expected US first quarter GDP data. A surprise rise in private-sector jobs this month along with data showing the US economy grew at a higher-than-expected pace initially fuelled further dollar buying. But some of the dollar's gains came off as details on US gross domestic product were not as positive as the headline number suggested. Analysts expected few fireworks ahead of Fed decision. ""I think the market is being driven by month-end liquidity and the Fed tonight,"" said an analyst from MKS Finance. ""Gold could trade sideways but I think the profit-taking will continue and that the lack of confidence in gold is going to increase,"" he said. The Fed is expected to unveil its decision to trim interest rates by a modest quarter percentage point at around 1815 GMT on Wednesday. Analysts say it may also suggest the rate-cutting cycle it kicked off last autumn has reached an end. NEW CATALYST Any pause in trimming rates would theoretically support the dollar and reduce gold's appeal as an alternative investment. But analysts revealed divisions towards the outlook for gold prices, with some expecting the metal to witness bursts of physical demand following heavy price declines in recent weeks. Gold has lost more than 15 percent in value since spiking to a record high at $1,030.80 on March 17, but the drop has attracted physical buying from jewellers. In the physical sector, jewellery makers from India to Indonesia have snapped up purchases of bullion after it dived to lower levels, pushing up premiums for gold bars in Southeast Asia. Expectations of further declines in the dollar over the coming three months should help support gold prices, said Suki Cooper, precious metals analyst at Barclays Capital. ""I don't think we will see a dramatic rally in gold unless a new catalyst emerges but the overall environment remains quite positive, and physical buying emerging on price dips should keep prices underpinned,"" she said. Spot platinum fell to $1,907.00/1,922.00 an ounce from $1,918/1,938 late on Tuesday. Silver edged down to $16.49/16.54 an ounce from $16.51/16.59 an ounce.

en.15.65.83.2008.5.5,Investors eye Yahoo's alternatives to Microsoft,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO May 5 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Yahoo Inc faced growing pressure on Sunday to find an alternative strategy to Microsoft Corp's $47.5 billion takeover offer after the software maker walked away over a disagreement on price. Yahoo shares could fall by more than 30 percent on Monday over the breakdown of talks, but that drop could be softened if Wall Street believes Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang has another strategy up his sleeve, analysts said. Yahoo is likely to push for an advertising partnership with Web search leader Google Inc, sources familiar with the matter said. A tie-up with Google, seen as a big winner from the end of Microsoft-Yahoo talks, should help boost Yahoo's operating performance in the near term. ""It's time to get a move on with Google,"" said Jeffrey Lindsay, analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. ""Let's hope they weren't bluffing."" Yahoo is also still considering a deal with another Internet media and advertising major, such as Time Warner Inc's AOL, people familiar with the discussions said. But Yang and the company he helped create could face a flood of shareholder lawsuits or other actions if nothing materializes. ""There are two things that could support the stock: the potential for Microsoft to return and the potential to do a Google deal,"" said Clayton Moran, analyst at Stanford Group. Moran said Yahoo shares could fall to the mid- to low-$20 range on Monday from their $28.67 close last week. Other analysts said it could slip closer to $19.18, where it closed on January 31, a day before Microsoft made its offer public. Microsoft shares are likely to rise on Monday, with its investors relieved that Chief Executive Steve Ballmer didn't shell out billions more for Yahoo, analysts said. Microsoft on Saturday sweetened its initial $31-per-share offer for Yahoo to $33, but then withdrew from the talks when Yang dug in for a price of $37. SHAREHOLDER CHALLENGE While some Yahoo investors hoped it could wrest a price closer to $35 per share from Microsoft, a dissident shareholder said he would challenge Yang and the board over the collapse of talks. ""Shareholders didn't even get a chance to vote on the deal, but the board negotiated on our behalf and not in good faith,"" Eric Jackson, who leads a group of investors who collectively own 2 million Yahoo shares, told Reuters. He said he would urge shareholders to withhold votes from the company's directors this year. Yahoo officials were not immediately available to comment. Bernstein's Lindsay estimates Yahoo could be worth up to $35 per share with a Google deal, and even $37 with more job cuts, but that drops to $25 per share if no partnerships are in the offing. Yahoo has conducted tests with Google to outsource some of its search listings to its arch-rival. It has also held talks in tandem with AOL and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. A source familiar with the matter said on Sunday that the News Corp talks had cooled in recent weeks. ""It increasingly appears like Yahoo will pursue a Google search partnership,"" said Moran, who said he still favored a Microsoft buyout. ""Given Google's position (in the market), a partnership with them cedes control and limits the long-term value creation for Yahoo."" BALLMER'S WARNING Ballmer portrayed Yahoo's options as particularly stark in a letter to Yang detailing his reasons for pulling back, and suggested any Google tie-up would preclude a Microsoft deal. Microsoft and Google are increasingly competing on the same turf, such as Web-based applications, email and messaging. The proposed Yahoo purchase was meant to create a fiercer rival to Google and challenge its hold on Internet advertising. ""The real winner in all of this seems to be Google,"" said Canaccord Adams analyst Colin Gillis. ""There's going to be no powerful number two"" in the Web market, he said. Gillis rated Yahoo a ""buy"" with a $35 price target before the deal talks with Microsoft collapsed. ""We were very clear that was not based on fundamentals,"" he said. Ballmer also warned Yahoo that it would give up its relationship with advertisers by coordinating with Google and could lose some of its best engineering talent. Some analysts disputed that idea, saying Yahoo's operating results would certainly benefit from a Google partnership. Other Google partners, including IAC/InterActiveCorp's Ask.com, have structured deals that keep them in control of their advertiser ties, Bernstein's Lindsay said."

City are due to play matches in Thailand and Hong Kong at the end of the season but reports that billionaire Thai owner Thaksin Shinawatra had decided to sack Eriksson have angered fans and players. ""The media speculation does not affect the visit,"" spokesman Paul Tyrell said in an e-mail sent to Thai media. ""Mr Eriksson will be attending. ""(The club) have made no comment about the manager's future. Dr Thaksin has stated there will be a full review at the end of the season."" Eriksson's agent Athole Still has said Thaksin, the former Thai prime minister, may fire the Swede after just one season, despite having met his target of a top-10 Premier League finish. Thaksin, who bought the club for 81 million pounds ($160 million) last July after being ousted by the military, gave no comment on Wednesday when asked about Eriksson's future by reporters in Bangkok. Thaksin did not attend City's 1-0 defeat at Liverpool on Sunday, where fans directed their anger towards him and called for Eriksson to be retained. City face a Thai all-stars team on May 17 before travelling to Hong Kong to play two matches. Thaksin, a former telecoms tycoon, is hoping big-name signings and the prospect of European soccer will help City become ""Asia's Premier League team"""
en.15.65.188.2008.5.6,Civilians targeted in Somalia conflict: Amnesty,"NAIROBI, Tue May 6,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All parties in Somalia's conflict have carried out rights abuses including executions, rape and torture, Amnesty International said on Tuesday, adding there were reports Ethiopian soldiers had slit civilians' throats. Mogadishu's whole population is scarred from witnessing or suffering such abuses, as well as enforced disappearances and beatings, it said in its 32-page report. Somali government troops and their Ethiopian allies have been battling Islamist-led insurgents since early last year. Yet the real scale of the ""dire"" rights crisis remained unknown because international aid agencies were under heavy pressure not to expose the abuses they witnessed, Amnesty said, and local journalists were often silenced by threats. The interim government has largely failed to impose its authority on the Horn of Africa country of some 8 million people, torn apart by inter-clan violence and vulnerable to cycles of drought, flooding and now skyrocketing food prices. The Ethiopian and Somali governments have frequently denied committing rights abuses in their fight against what they call al Qaeda-backed terrorists. Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein has said government troops have the right to defend themselves. But many Somalis living in southern and central areas say life is worse now than when dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was toppled by warlords in 1991, plunging the country into lawlessness. Up to 1 million Somalis are refugees in their own land, while an estimated 6,500 civilians were killed last year. Amnesty said since late 2007 it had received an increase in reports of violations against civilians by Ethiopian forces who helped the government oust Islamist leaders at the end of 2006"
en.15.65.80.2008.5.3,"Bill Clinton has 1,000 pledges to aid world`s poor","New York, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bill Clinton's philanthropic summit has spurred nearly 1,000 commitments in the past three years from business, nonprofit and government leaders that aim to improve the lives of 200 million of the world's poor. In a mid-year update of his Clinton Global Initiative summit held each September, Clinton gave a progress report of the commitments, including one by Rajendra Pachauri, the head of the U.N.'s climate science panel. ""He has a little idea with massive potential implications,"" Clinton said about Pachauri's CGI commitment, ""Lighting a Million Lives in India."" Since the agreement, Pachauri's nonprofit group, called The Energy and Resources Institute, has brought 30,000 solar-powered lanterns to 300 Indian villages. The lanterns allow children to study and adults to work past sunset in rural India, where some 78 million homes lack electricity, while eliminating unhealthy kerosene lantern fumes as well as greenhouse gas emissions. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) commitments focus on education, climate, health and poverty alleviation. Some 200 have already been completed, CGI said. Other commitments range from $100,000 in support by the Hashoo Foundation for women beekeepers in Pakistan to a estimated $1.5 million in support from the United Methodist Church to fight malaria in the Ivory Coast with insecticide-treated nets. Donning glasses to read the details of one of the commitments, Clinton said, ""George Washington once said, 'I'm going blind for my country,' and I'm going blind for my candidate."" It was Clinton's only reference to his wife Hillary's presidential campaign during the New York event. CGI pledges are not required to lay out a minimum amount of money, but they are binding in a sense: parties that do not live up to them are barred from the annual summit, a glitzy mix of global leaders and celebrities. Visa Inc on Friday made the CGI's first commitment of 2008, pledging to increase financial literacy for 10 million people over five years. ""Our products are very useful tools in enabling the unbanked to enter the formal financial system,"" said Doug Michelman, head of global corporate relations for Visa. He said the products can be used for small loans or salary payments, allowing people to avoid check cashing fees. The company, which went public last month, did not reveal how much money it planned to commit. In December, Clinton will hold a separate CGI summit in Hong Kong in the hope that Asians will keep the issues on the agenda as economies from China to India grow rapidly."
en.15.65.287.2008.5.6,"UBS to cut 5,500 jobs in subprime wake","ZURICH, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS AG said it would cut 5,500 jobs or almost 7 percent of its workforce through layoffs and attrition in the wake of the subprime credit crisis as it reverses a rapid expansion into investment banking. UBS said conditions in the financial markets and the global economy remained difficult and reported a first-quarter loss of 11.535 billion Swiss francs ($10.93 billion), slightly better than what it had already announced in April. The bank recorded net inflows in its two wealth management businesses of 5.6 billion francs, according to a statement on Tuesday. Analysts polled by Reuters on average had expected inflows of 9 billion and a net loss of 11.9 billion. UBS is Europe's biggest banking sector casualty of the subprime crisis after posting over $37 billion in writedowns. The crisis ripped a hole in UBS's balance sheet and exposed widespread weaknesses in strategy, risk control and management culture. UBS has since pared its ambitions, swept out senior management, and raised around 39 billion francs in new capital. Tuesday's announcements mark the largest effort made to date by the bank to reshape itself and face a downturn in the investment banking sector. UBS was widely expected to slash around 10 percent of its investment banking workforce of 22,000. Pressure remains on UBS to do more, with activist investor group Olivant criticizing UBS's choice of lawyer Peter Kurer as its new chairman, and calling on the bank to consider selling off its investment bank. UBS shares have risen around 15 percent in the past month, compared with a rise of roughly 3 percent in the Dow Jones European banking sector index, making it the biggest heavyweight gainer as confidence returns to the financial markets. Prior to the recent rally, UBS was the biggest share price loser among heavyweight blue chips. Analysts expect the bank to post a net loss of over 5 billion Swiss francs in 2008 on the back of subprime writedowns, restructuring costs and lower earnings"
en.15.65.383.2008.5.6,Ten Iraqi soldiers slain in checkpoint attack,"Mon May 5, BAGHDAD (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Suspected al Qaeda militants killed 10 Iraqi soldiers at a checkpoint in Iraq's restive Diyala province north of Baghdad on Monday, the U.S. military said. The military said 13 soldiers were also wounded in the attack. It gave no details of the incident, but an Iraqi army source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the victims were decapitated after being shot. The account could not be independently confirmed. The army source said the attack took place in the town of Balad Ruz, where police arrested 75 suspected militants last week and seized a quantity of weapons. Al Qaeda has proved a resilient foe in Diyala province, a religiously mixed region that is one of four northern provinces where U.S. and Iraqi forces have sought to oust the Sunni Islamist militants from safe havens. ""Attacks of this nature against those who are working to protect the citizens of Iraq ... are yet another example of the barbarous nature of al Qaeda in Iraq,"" U.S. military spokeswoman Major Peggy Kageleiry said."
en.15.65.98.2008.4.30,Food crisis may stoke more malnutrition than famine,"GENEVA, Wed Apr 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Global food shortages and higher prices are more likely to cause malnutrition than outright famine, at least in the near-term, the coordinator of a new United Nations task force said on Wednesday. John Holmes, who also serves as the UN's top humanitarian aid official, said it was too early to estimate how much extra money will be needed to confront crises stemming from increasingly unaffordable food staples in poor countries. ""People, particularly those on the lowest incomes, will be eating less and less well,"" he told a news conference in Geneva, where much of the UN's emergency aid operations are managed. ""I don't think that in the very short term we are talking about starvation and famine,"" Holmes said. Protests, strikes and riots have erupted in developing countries around the world in the wake of dramatic rises in the prices of wheat, rice, corn, oils and other essential foods that have made it difficult for poor people to make ends meet. ""It is not possible as yet to put a figure on what the immediate humanitarian needs may be for the forthcoming year,"" Holmes said. ""We need to put those funding needs together."" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced on Tuesday that he was launching a task force to ensure a solid, coordinated international response to the food crisis. Holmes said that group would likely include the heads of key agencies such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Food Program, Food and Agriculture Organization, World Trade Organization, World Health Organization and International Fund for Agricultural Development. VULNERABLE GROUPS The task force will work to draft a strategy on both short- and long-term responses to food supply strains, which economists have linked to factors including high fuel and fertilizer costs, the use of crops for biofuels, and commodity market speculation. Holmes called on donor governments to provide extra money in response to the crisis that has touched countries from Peru to Indonesia to Afghanistan to Senegal, and squeezed the World Food Program's efforts to feed millions of people. Young children, who can face life-long health problems from malnourishment, as well as pregnant and nursing mothers, are among the most vulnerable groups in developing countries, where food crises also stand to trigger political unrest. ""The challenges here are likely to be of sufficient dimension that we will be asking for additional contributions,"" Holmes said, noting that the UN's pot of rainy-day cash -- known as the Central Emergency Response Fund, or CERF -- had already disbursed money for various food-related crises. ""CERF is available for precisely these types of situations,"" he said. ""Will CERF be big enough to respond to those needs? That is a question I cannot answer yet."" Ban has made climate change and food security two of his top priorities as UN chief, a post he has held since January 2006. The South Korean national chastised countries on Tuesday for not taking more seriously warnings from the Food and Agriculture Organization and others about the likely pinch of food prices. ""We predicted even two to three years ago that this crisis would come. I am sorry that the international community had not listened more attentively,"" he told a public lecture in Geneva"
en.15.65.412.2008.5.4,Thousands evacuated as Chile volcano spews ash,"CHAITEN, Chile, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Covered in thick ash, the Patagonian community of Chaiten was a ghost town on Saturday as a volcano spewed ash a day after its first eruption in thousands of years forced nearly 4,500 people to flee. Authorities have evacuated most of the southern Chilean town's residents since Friday, sending many by boat to Chiloe Island farther north and to Puerto Montt on the mainland. Some are staying in guesthouses, while schools have been turned into makeshift shelters packed with stores of bottled water after a blanket of volcanic ash contaminated ground water. Only a few dozen people remained in Chaiten, whose snow-capped volcano of the same name erupted on Friday, triggering earth tremors and spewing a cloud of ash two miles into the air. There is no record of the volcano erupting in the last 2,000 years, according to Sernageomin, a government mining and geology agency. Ricardo Larenas, 32, took his wife and two children to safety in Puerto Montt, then went back to protect their belongings. ""I came back here after living in Norway for 16 years. I brought a lot of money with me and frittered it away. My furniture workshop is all I have left,"" he said. Southern Chile is fragmented into hundreds of small islands and fjords. Some residents had never ventured from Chaiten itself until the 3,280-foot (1,000-meter) volcano six miles (10 km) away forced them to go. ""I am amazed how big the continent is,"" said Claudia, an elderly resident, on arriving by boat at the southern island of Chiloe, mistaking it for mainland Chile. ""I have never left Chaiten before."" She clasped a plastic bag containing a few basic items she had managed to salvage before being evacuated. Technicians were dispatched to restore phone in the area, 760 miles south of the capital of Santiago, and ensure electricity supplies while experts took water samples. Before they were ferried to safety, some people in the area wore white surgical facemasks to avoid inhaling the ash that lay 6 inches deep in some areas. The National Emergency Office said volcanic activity continued, with fine ash falling. Visibility remained poor as ash clouded the skies and the smell of sulfur hung heavy in the air. ""The panorama here is pretty complicated,"" Interior Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma said during a visit to the area. ""We have completed the first phase of the operation, which was the evacuation of practically all of the local population. ""We don't know if this is a situation that will last days, or weeks or even more."" Schools were closed on Friday, and hospitals treated people for irritated eyes and breathing difficulties. Across the nearby border in Argentina, authorities in Chubut province asked residents to avoid rubbing their eyes and to wear glasses and long sleeves to avoid ash making contact with skin. Chile's 2,000 volcanoes include two of Latin America's most active -- Villarica and Llaima. Scientists say some 500 are potentially active. Chile has the world's second most active string of volcanoes behind Indonesia. Llaima, about 435 miles south of Santiago, erupted on New Year's Day, spewing ash and molten lava and forcing dozens of tourists and staff to evacuate a wilderness park. It also belched ash in February and lava crept down its slopes."

en.15.65.115.2008.5.3,"Mugabe to contest Zimbabwe run-off, MDC cries foul","Harare, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe accepted that the opposition's Morgan Tsvangirai won more votes in the presidential election and will contest a run-off in a political battle that has raised fears of bloodshed. Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) cried foul after Zimbabwe's electoral body announced on Friday that he had won 47.9 percent of the vote but faces a run-off after failing to gain enough votes for an outright majority. The MDC described the announcement of the long-delayed result as ""scandalous daylight robbery"". It says Tsvangirai won more than 50 percent of the vote in the March 29 election and Mugabe's 28-year rule is over. But Mugabe's old foe has few options. If Tsvangirai refuses to take part in a second round, Mugabe would keep his hold on power according to electoral law. The MDC said it would decide at the weekend whether to contest a run-off. An aide to Mugabe said the president accepted the result of the first round and would contest a run-off. ""The presidential result as announced do not reflect the genuine expression of the will of the Zimbabwean people given the many anomalies, malpractices, deflation of figures relating to ZANU-PF candidates,"" chief election agent Emmerson Mnangagwa told reporters. Western powers expressed doubt that a run-off could be fair. ""For any second round of the presidential election to be considered free and fair ... an end of violence as well as the presence of international observers is of crucial importance,"" said a statement by current European Union president Slovenia. Chief Elections Officer Lovemore Sekeramayi said Tsvangirai won 47.9 percent with Mugabe, who has ruled since independence from Britain, on 43.2 percent. Independent Simba Makoni, a ruling party defector, took 8.3 percent. ""Since no candidate has received the majority of the total votes cast ... a second election shall be held on a date to be announced by the commission,"" Sekeramayi said. ECONOMIC MELTDOWN The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) will set the date of the run-off which should by law be held within 21 days of the result. But the ZEC has the power to extend this and political observers say a 40-day period is likely. The opposition, critics and human rights groups have accused Mugabe of unleashing militias to scare Zimbabweans into backing him in the run-off. The government denies the allegation and says MDC members have carried out political violence. Zimbabweans had hoped the election would herald the end of an economic meltdown that has brought food and fuel shortages and the world's highest inflation rate of over 165,000 percent. Instead, they are victims of a political struggle between a president critics call ruthless and Tsvangirai, who has spent his time outside the country, not among supporters at home risking crackdowns. ""I don't think it's in anyone's interest not to have a peaceful resolution. Investors hope they are seeing the beginning of the end but they know that might take weeks or months,"" said Richard Segal, Africa strategist at Renaissance Capital. MDC Secretary General Tendai Biti told a news conference in neighboring South Africa the results showed Tsvangirai should be declared president. ""According to the law, the person receiving the highest number of votes is the president of the republic of Zimbabwe with effect from the day of such declaration,"" he said. CREDIBILITY PROBLEMS The United States and former colonial power Britain questioned the credibility of the official results. U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey said: ""That final tally, I think, has rather serious credibility problems given the inexplicably long delays and some of the post-election irregularities."" British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said: ""While the process lacks transparency, it is clear that President Mugabe lost the presidential election. His campaign of violence and intimidation over the last month must stop immediately."" Mugabe accuses Britain of plotting with the opposition to oust him. Opposition spokesman Nelson Chamisa told Reuters: ""This whole thing is a scandal, scandalous daylight robbery and everyone knows that. We won this election outright."""

en.15.65.348.2008.5.6,Dozens of Iraqi police detained in operation,"BAGHDAD, Tue May 6,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has ordered the formation of a committee to compile evidence of Iranian ""interference"" in Iraq that will then be presented to Tehran, the government spokesman said on Sunday. Spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh was speaking a day after a delegation from Iraq's ruling Shia alliance returned from Tehran after showing Iranian officials evidence of the Islamic Republic's backing of Shia militias in Iraq. Dabbagh said Iranian officials who met that delegation had denied any meddling in Iraq. ""The prime minister has ordered the formation of a committee to document the interference of the Iranians in Iraqi affairs. The Iraqi government will follow up with the Iranians and put (these findings) in front of them,"" Dabbagh told Reuters. At an earlier news conference Dabbagh appeared to distance the government from US accusations of Iranian interference in Iraq. He had said Iraq would not be pushed into conflict with its neighbor and wanted its own inquiry to find ""tangible information and not information based on speculation."" Asked by Reuters what evidence existed so far, Dabbagh said Iranian missiles had been found in the southern city of Basra during a recent crackdown on militias in the southern city. ""The proof we have is weapons which are shown to be made in Iran. We want to trace back how they reached (Iraq), who is using them, where are they getting it,"" Dabbagh said. Washington accuses Iran of funding, arming and training Shia militias to attack US-led troops and Iraqi government forces, despite its public commitment to stabilizing Iraq. Tehran blames the violence on the presence of US forces The US military said last week ""very, very significant"" amounts of Iranian arms had been found in Basra and also Baghdad during an offensive against militiamen loyal to anti-American Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr that began in late March. Some of those arms were made in 2008, the military said. US military officials had planned to display some of the weapons but decided to let the Iraqis make their own case to Iran first. Dabbagh said the government committee would be comprised of representatives of the various security ministries. NO PROXY WAR The Iraqis have repeatedly said they do not want their territory to become a battleground for a proxy war between the United States and Iran. The arch-foes are at loggerheads over Iran's nuclear ambitions. ""We don't want to be pushed into any conflict with any neighboring countries, especially Iran. What happened before is enough. We paid a lot,"" Dabbagh told the earlier news conference, referring to the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war in which an estimated 1 million people died. ""It happened because the others pushed Iraq to take an aggressive stance with Iran. We want to organize relations with all neighboring countries to preserve the interests of Iraq."" Ties between Iran and Iraq have improved since Sunni Arab strongman Saddam Hussein was ousted in the US-led invasion and a Shia-led government came to power in Baghdad. Analysts say Tehran wants to keep a friendly, Shia-led government in charge but also wants to ensure rival Iraqi Shia factions look to Iran as a power broker. Iran's ISNA news agency said on Sunday Iran backed efforts by the Iraqi government to disarm militias and would ""make its utmost efforts to establish security in Iraq"". The US military said on Sunday it killed nine militants in helicopter strikes overnight in eastern Baghdad, where battles have raged between troops and Sadr's Mehdi Army fighters. Much of the fighting took place in and around the crowded Shia slum of Sadr City, the cleric's stronghold in Baghdad. Despite an overall improvement in Iraq's security, levels of violence are still high. The wife of Iraq's president, Jalal Talabani, escaped a roadside bomb attack on her convoy near the national theatre in central Baghdad in which four security guards were wounded. Gunmen also shot dead a journalist in the northern city of Mosul after pulling her out of a taxi. A colleague said she had received a text message on her mobile phone three weeks ago warning her to stop reporting"

A report said middle-class Canadians saw their median earnings grow only 0.1 percent between 1980 and 2005, while top earners enjoyed a 16 percent jump over the same period. The poorest Canadians, meanwhile, saw earnings plummet 20 percent. ""Frankly, it's a wake-up call. This is happening at the tail end of a solid economic performance for Canada, and yet only a small group of Canadians are seeing the benefits,"" said Armine Yalnizyan, an economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. Although Canada's job growth is outpacing the US, most of it is in the lower-paying service sector, Yalnizyan told Reuters. At the same time, a slump in manufacturing jobs, combined with rising housing prices and higher education costs, took their toll on the middle class, she said. ""Despite the fact that the middle class are better educated, more women are working, and more people in the household are working, they're just peddling faster and getting nowhere,"" Yalnizyan said. The data also painted a gloomy picture for young people entering the workforce, who are facing more contract work and fewer benefits than their parents did a generation ago. Median earnings for male workers between ages 25 and 29 dropped to C$37,680 ($36,980) in 2005 from an inflation-adjusted C$43,767 in 1980. Earnings among women 25-29 dropped less significantly to C$32,104 in 2005 from C$32,813 in 1980"

With 22,500 dead and 41,000 missing, most of them from a massive storm surge that washed over the Irrawaddy delta, it is the most devastating cyclone to hit Asia since 1991, when 143,000 people died in neighboring Bangladesh. ""Time is of the essence,"" Ann Veneman, Executive Director of the United Nations children's fund UNICEF, said in a statement. ""In situations such as these, children are highly vulnerable to disease and hunger and they need immediate help to survive."" Aid officials estimate hundreds of thousands are homeless in the swamplands of the delta southwest of the biggest city Yangon, which was also hard hit by last weekend's storm. State-run Myanmar TV, the main official source for the number of casualties, on Wednesday re-broadcast Tuesday night's news bulletin. The TV station, monitored outside Myanmar, reported just under 22,500 killed and 41,000 missing. Aid groups and governments, including U.S. President George W. Bush, have urged the secretive military to relax their tight grip to allow humanitarian assistance into Myanmar, which has been ruled by the military for 46 years. In a rare news conference on Tuesday, Information Minister Kyaw Hsan appealed for help, saying ""the government needs the cooperation of the people and well-wishers from home and abroad"". LONG QUEUES A queue of women and children holding buckets and tubs snaked around a corner in Yangon on Wednesday, past a street market where vegetables sold at three times last week's prices despite government appeals to traders not to profit from the disaster. The overall mood in the city of five million was of resignation rather than revolution, but some anger on the streets at soaring food prices and long queues for petrol. ""There won't be demonstrations,"" one taxi driver said. ""People don't want to be shot."" Last September, the military violently cracked down on Buddhist monk-led demonstrations. The junta has been vilified by Western governments for suppressing dissent. The U.N.'s World Food Programme began doling out rice in Yangon. The first batch of more than $10 million of foreign aid arrived from Thailand but lack of equipment slowed distribution. Two more aid flights are due to land from India early on Wednesday. ""The food security situation in the country, which was already severe, is likely to become more acute,"" the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in its most recent assessment of the disaster. France said the former Burma's ruling generals were still placing too many conditions on aid. ""The United Nations is asking the Burmese government to open its doors. The Burmese government replies: 'Give us money, we'll distribute it.' We can't accept that,"" Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner told parliament. Rashid Khalikov, a senior U.N. aid official, appealed to Myanmar to waive visa requirements for U.N. aid workers trying to get into the country of 53 million. Reflecting the scale of the crisis, the junta said it would postpone by two weeks a constitutional referendum in the worst-hit areas. The referendum, part of the army's much-criticized ""roadmap to democracy,"" would proceed as planned elsewhere on Saturday."

PCB Chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf filed the defamation suit in a civil court after Shoaib accused him in a television interview of demanding money from him and other players to allow them to play in a lucrative Twenty20 league in India. The allegations came after Shoaib was banned for five years by the PCB's disciplinary committee for several counts of indiscipline. Shoaib made an unconditional apology at an appeal hearing late last month and the PCB on Sunday suspended the ban for one month to allow him to play in the league. ""Shoaib came and apologised to the PCB Chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf in person and showed remorse and asked for forgiveness, accepting that he had levelled false and baseless allegations against him,"" lawyer Tafazzul Rizvi told Reuters. Rizvi said the PCB chairman had therefore decided not to pursue the suit. ""We will withdraw the case from court since the honour and dignity of the PCB chairman stand vindicated,"" Rizvi added. Akhtar left for Delhi on Sunday to play in the league"
en.15.65.478.2008.5.7,"Japan, China vow to deepen trust, settle gas row","Tokyo, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leaders of Japan and China vowed on Wednesday to deepen trust and cooperate on issues from climate change to regional security, and said they were on track to resolve a feud over energy rights in the East China Sea. Friction over history, undersea gas reserves, military plans, international influence and consumer safety has divided the neighbors, and mutual public distrust runs deep. The summit between Chinese President Hu Jintao and Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda is meant to ease the feuding and build on a recent warming in often chilly ties, settling on a blueprint for relations between Asia's two economic giants. ""We both believe relations between China and Japan are at a new starting point,"" Hu told a joint news conference with Fukuda. The two leaders also said they had made progress to resolve a dispute over rights to gas beneath the East China Sea. ""There are already prospects for resolving this issue,"" Hu said, adding the two sides would continue consultation and seek a solution as soon as possible. The 71-year-old Fukuda, long a proponent of warmer ties with Japan's Asian neighbors, said good two-way ties were vital for the region and the world. ""Japan and China both need to create a good future for Asia and the world together by recognizing their responsibility in the international community and by constantly deepening mutual understanding and mutual trust, and expanding mutual cooperation,"" Fukuda told the news conference. The two leaders signed a joint document on future relations between the two Asian economic giants, agreeing that ""cooperation for peace and friendship is the only option for Japan and China"". Sino-Japanese ties chilled during Junichiro Koizumi's 2001-2006 term as Japan's prime minister over his visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni war shrine, seen by critics as an offensive symbol of wartime misdeeds, but improved after Koizumi stepped down."

Bayern Munich wrapped up the Bundesliga title on Sunday but the second and third Champions League places are still up for grabs. Schalke started poorly away at Bochum but Gerald Asamoah put them ahead with a classic far-post header in the first half and Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitic made the game safe midway through the second half. Marcelo Bordon headed in a late third. The result takes Schalke, who reached the Champions League quarter-finals this year, up to second place on 58 points, with two matches to play. Werder Bremen, third on 57, play a tricky game in hand away to fourth-placed Hamburg SV on Wednesday. Second place in the Bundesliga gives direct entry to the Champions League, while third is enough for a place in the final qualifying round. VfB Stuttgart hopes of snatching third were effectively ended when the outgoing champions lost 3-2 away to Borussia Dortmund in another of Tuesday's matches. Dortmund moved ahead late in the first half when Tinga struck just inside the post. Mario Gomez equalised 10 minutes after the break but two goals from Alexander Frei, the first a free kick, the second a tap-in, put Dortmund two clear. Gomez struck his 18th league goal of the season with a few minutes to go but Dortmund held on. Stuttgart stay fifth on 51 points, meaning the best they can now hope for is a UEFA Cup place"
en.15.65.357.2008.5.4,Rice to push Israel to lift more West Bank barriers,"JERUSALEM, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will on Sunday urge Israel to remove more West Bank roadblocks as she meets Israeli and Palestinian officials to try to accelerate their peace talks. Speaking at the beginning of a two-day visit to the region on Saturday night, Rice said she would review Israel's steps on the ground to see if they had improved the daily lives of Palestinians, including promised removal of barriers. ""The first thing we are going to do is to review the ones that were supposedly moved,"" Rice said, adding she wanted to discuss with Israeli officials how significant those barriers were to allowing greater movement for the Palestinians. ""Not all roadblocks are created equal,"" Rice said. Rice met Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert after her arrival in Jerusalem on Saturday and will meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Sunday. Abbas and Olmert, who are due to meet on Monday following Rice's departure, agreed in November to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching an agreement by the end of this year. The peace negotiations have yet to show tangible progress. After Rice's last trip in late March, Israel said it planned to remove 61 barriers in the occupied West Bank. But a U.N. survey subsequently found that only 44 obstacles had been scrapped and that most were of little or no significance. Western pressure is mounting on Olmert to do more to ease travel restrictions and take other steps to shore up Abbas, whose authority has been limited to the West Bank since Hamas Islamists took over the Gaza Strip in June. On Saturday, Abbas's security forces deployed to the northern West Bank city of Jenin for a law-and-order campaign meant to show the government is laying the ground for statehood. Israel has so far balked at removing many barriers, arguing they are necessary to prevent suicide bombers. The Palestinians call them collective punishment. Rice also plans to hold trilateral meetings with the top peace negotiators, Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Ahmed Qurei of the Palestinians, and with Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak. Rice said the most important part of her talks would be to review ""where we are in terms of the situation on the ground and the improvement of life for the Palestinian people."" U.S. officials are sensitive to the lack of demonstrable progress in the talks and they hope to use a visit by U.S. President George W Bush, who will travel to the region this month to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Israel's founding, to nudge them along."
en.15.65.125.2008.5.6,Boom in private banking for uber-rich,"LONDON, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - They have the mooring in St Tropez and the country house in the Cotswolds but there is one other thing that the wealthy elite cannot live without a private banker. It is a service they can well afford. Despite the global credit crunch, the rich are getting richer and are now worth more than 400 billion pounds, according to the Sunday Times' annual Rich List, published last week. But the private banking sector is no longer the reserve of the ultra-rich. At one time, these boutique financiers were largely concerned with old money: that of the landed gentry with their double-barrelled surnames. But there is a growing influx, too, of new money: celebrities, City types who net huge bonuses, and rich foreigners -- from Eastern Europe, Russia and the Middle East -- coming to Britain and buying up property. Footballers, ""it"" girls and entrepreneurs too busy building their businesses to handle their own money are increasingly on the books, signing up to all-inclusive money management services that come with lofty annual fee structures and unspecified tax advantages. It follows, then, that global private banking assets under management are on the up. They are now the equivalent to the entire gross domestic product of Britain, France and Germany, or one and a half times the market capitalisation of all companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. They hit $7.6 trillion (3.8 trillion pounds) this year -- up 128 percent on the year, according to Euromoney's benchmark annual survey of the wealth management industry. ""While concerns grow about the state of the economy, there is no doubt that global wealth continues to increase at a rapid pace,"" says Clive Horwood, editor of Euromoney magazine. ""These wealthy individuals and families are spread over an increasingly diversified geographic base and are demanding a higher quality of service from companies and people who manage their wealth. ""It's no surprise, therefore, that all of the world's leading financial institutions are focusing more of their efforts on this high-growth, but extremely challenging, business opportunity."" A growing number of high street banks are getting in on the act too, on the back of the booming economy of recent years that has pushed house prices sky-high and led to a growing mass affluent sector. Their premier banking services are aimed at those who want to receive a service akin to that enjoyed by the elite, but have nothing near the same amount of money. Above all, these and their more traditional counterparts claim to offer a more personal service than standard current accounts. But, other than the associated prestige, what exactly do you get? And do either offer real value for money? Big-name global investment banks and asset managers -- Credit Suisse, Schroders and Barclays Wealth among them -- offer private banking services. Traditional private banks are lesser-known among the population at large, but many have been around for eons. C Hoare & Co was founded in 1672 by Richard Hoare at the sign of the Golden Bottle in Cheapside, London, while Coutts & Co, now the private banking arm of the Royal Bank of Scotland, has its roots in 1692, when a young Scot, John Campbell of Lundie, set up business as a goldsmith-banker at the sign of the Three Crowns in the Strand. The earliest extant records show that not only did Campbell supply plate and jewellery; he also offered a comprehensive banking service, discounting bills, making loans and taking deposits. Many of his customers were his fellow countrymen, including his clan chief, the Duke of Argyll. Campbell enjoyed royal patronage when Queen Anne commissioned him to make the collars and badges for the Order of the Thistle. And today Coutts -- a name that first appeared in the title of the bank in 1755 when Scottish banker James Coutts was taken into partnership -- is famed for looking after the money of members of the Royal Family. The heritage of Butterfield Private Bank, meanwhile, stretches back to 1858, when a merchant trading firm founded by entrepreneur Nathaniel T Butterfield became the Bank of NT Butterfield & Son. Its London-based private banking arm was incorporated under previous ownership in 1979 and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of NT Butterfield in 2001. It has six other offices around the globe, unsurprisingly in tax havens and places associated with the uber-rich: the Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey and Switzerland. In the Caribbean its doors are open to all -- from the man who runs the beach bar to rich and famous residents. In Britain, though, only the elite need apply for its top-end services: clients of its ""family"" division have five million-pounds plus, but it aims to attract those with wealth of double that or more. For its entrepreneur services, it has an unwritten entry level of one million pounds of investable assets, but will entertain the idea of taking on those with 250,000 pounds to invest in cases where there is ""potential"". Services offered are holistic -- everything from day-to-day banking and investment management to complex tax affairs and arranging credit for a new yacht. ""There's quite a bit of conducting the orchestra,"" says Butterfield director Raymond Sykes. ""It's quite bizarre: one minute you can be arranging some complex loan facility or setting up trusts for the wayward kids, and the next minute you can be sending a cheque book out to a client."" Particularly at the higher end, the client is king: their wish is the private banker's command, and some of the services offered are more akin to those of a concierge or butler. ""For some clients, we run their charities,"" says Sykes. ""Then we have clients where we will get the Bentley down to Geneva. ""And we'll make sure flowers are on old Jimmy's grave once a year because he was a faithful retainer."" This type of thing, he says, is a bit of a throw-back from the bygone era of private banking. But, if anything, private banks are doing more of it as clients become more cash rich, time poor. ""We're not quite getting theatre tickets or booking flights to Hong Kong, but (with) anything a bit more usual and the client has nowhere else to go and can't be bothered doing it themselves, they'll ask the bank,"" says Sykes. All this comes at a cost. Most products are tailor-made and rates are negotiable dependant on the complexity of work undertaken, as well as clients' wealth and connections. Full-time management of an entire family's wealth could cost up to 30,000 pounds per year, says Andrew Jackson, fellow Butterfield director and head of its product expert group. At the other end of the spectrum, day-to-day banking is free, but clients pay for extra services. Increasingly, people with less impressive bank balances are able to buy into the idea of banking for the elite through a growing number of premium financial services. There are almost half a million British households with a joint income of more than 100,000 pounds, and 2.7 million people with more than that in liquid assets to invest. For little or no fee, consumers are able to side-step overseas call centres and hanging on hold for someone to answer their call. Instead, they can tap into a priority customer service with their own account manager. Whether such accounts are little more than a high street bank account with a gold-edged cheque book is open for debate, though many do come with added perks. RBS and its sister bank, NatWest, offer a free private banking service to those who earn 75,000 pounds or more, or a total 100,000 pounds with their partners. Customers receive a priority helpline, investment advice and a range of services typical of ""packaged"" current accounts (bank accounts that levy a monthly fee) -- free worldwide travel insurance, fraud protection, mobile phone cover and handbag insurance. HSBC's premier service also has an entry level of 75,000 pounds, or 50,000 pounds-worth of savings and investments. Those with a mortgage of 250,000 pounds or more with the bank also qualify for the account, which give customers access to exclusive lounges in upmarket ""premier"" branches. Other accounts have monthly charges. Barclays ""premier life"" service charges 17.50 pounds per month, or 25 pounds if you do not earn 100,000 pounds per year (60,000 pounds for the under-35s) or have 50,000 pounds to invest. It gives access to a ""premier relationship team"", exclusive products and services, preferential rates and comes with a free annual finance review. Meanwhile, NatWest's ""advantage private"" account charges a monthly 18.50 pounds and gives discounts on standard customer borrowing rates, access to 16 UK airport lounges, 25 percent off theatre and concert tickets, plus a worldwide concierge service. It is, however, ""in essence one step up from a standard packaged account offered by many high street institutions"", says Andrew Hagger, head of news and press at price comparison website Moneyfacts.co.uk. Similarly, there are credit cards that give access to concierge services. The Goldfish i24 MasterCard is available to those with an annual income of 50,000 pounds-plus, and comes at a price of 275 pounds per year, while the ""ultima"" reward card from Citi has an entry level of 100,000 pounds-worth of income and costs 300 pounds per annum. Perks include a personal assistant to organise special access to top golf courses and restaurants. ""There is a difference between what's known as premier banking -- whereby you can obtain preferential benefits if you're prepared to pay a fee and you meet the income criteria -- and private banking, which is a far more tailor-made solution for those that are cash and/ or asset rich,"" says Hagger. ""There's no doubt that people are increasingly buying into premier banking services. They might give an air of exclusivity, but are only really worth it if you're going to make full use of the incentives."
en.15.65.1.2008.5.6,Oil jumps $4 to record over $120 on weak dollar,"Mon May 5, NEW YORK (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Oil jumped more than $4 to a record high over $120 a barrel on Monday on the weaker U.S. dollar and supply concerns from OPEC members Nigeria and Iran. U.S. crude settled up $3.65 at $119.97 after surging as high as $120.36. London Brent crude rose $3.43 to $117.99 in light trade due to a bank holiday in Britain, after hitting $118.58 a barrel. ""People are piling back up on crude oil due to the weakness of the dollar and production issues in Nigeria,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago. ""But it also looks like momentum play after Friday's positive reaction to the unemployment report."" U.S. government data released Friday that showed U.S. payrolls fell by 20,000 jobs in March, a quarter of the losses expected, helping to counter concerns that the weaker U.S. economy could drag down oil demand. The dollar fell broadly on Monday, however, as forex investors decided the world's biggest economy was still struggling. A Monday report from the Institute for Supply Management showed the U.S. service sector grew unexpectedly in April. Further support for oil came from Iran's announcement on Monday it would not consider any incentives offered by world powers that would constrain its right to nuclear technology. The comments come just three days after major powers said they would make a new offer to convince the Islamic republic to halt its nuclear plans. The West believes Tehran wants to build nuclear weapons. Iran's standoff with the West over its nuclear program added geopolitical concerns and fundamental tightness last year that sent crude to new highs. Crude has kept surging since then, extending a six-year rally that has more than quintupled prices, on a wave of investment by speculators seeking to hedge against inflation and the weak dollar. U.S. President George W. Bush, who has called upon oil cartel OPEC to increase output to help bring down prices, is expected to talk with officials from Saudi Arabia about the effects of high fuel prices on the U.S. economy on his trip to the world's top exporter later this month. OPEC officials have rejected calls from consumer nations to ramp up production. They blame speculators for surging oil prices. Additional supply worries came from Nigeria, where Royal Dutch Shell was forced to shut more of its production after militants on Saturday attacked a flowstation in the oil-rich Niger Delta. Renewed clashes between Turkey and Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq also lent support to oil prices. The Turkish army said on Saturday it killed more than 150 Kurdish PKK fighters in air strikes in northern Iraq last week, but the rebel group denied this and security forces in the region also expressed skepticism. A Reuters poll of analysts forecast a weekly U.S. government report on inventories due out on Wednesday will show a 1.8-million-barrel build in crude stocks, a 1.1-million-barrel increase in distillate inventories, and a 100,000-barrel fall in gasoline stocks"
en.15.65.69.2008.5.2,Volatility snaps rice-wheat price link,"Naveen Thukral KUALA LUMPUR, May 2 -- (bdnews24.com/Reuters) Unprecedented volatility in rice and wheat prices has upended the traditional price link between the world's two staple foods, and analysts say it may stay broken for longer than usual this time. After decades when prices usually moved in lock-step with each other, the two have diverged in recent months. Thai rice is now nearly three times the price of U.S. wheat, an almost record high premium that could force aid agencies, and poorer consumers, to favour the cheaper staple, analysts say. Although it is unlikely to cause a big enough change in behavior to rebalance prices swiftly, they say that over time wheat prices should ultimately move closer to the Asian staple. ""Wheat may go down 15 percent to 20 percent from current levels, but rice is going to stay more expensive because the governments now have tendencies to build stocks,"" said John Baize, a U.S.-based commodities analyst. ""The differential will be pretty high."" Since 1980, hard red winter wheat in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico has traded at an average of 43 percent less than rice in Thailand, the world's top exporter, IMF data show. By and large, wheat prices traded at between 40 and 60 percent of the price of rice, and any deviation was quickly corrected. But prices are now testing the extremes of that bond. Back in October, wheat prices zoomed to near parity with rice, as speculators piled into the U.S. grains market amid a heavy drain on global stocks; that has happened only once before. Since then, wheat markets have plunged nearly 40 percent from February peaks as farmers plant a bumper crop, while rice prices have nearly trebled to a record above $1,000 a tonne on panic buying fuelled by export curbs from India and Vietnam, though they are now showing signs of easing. For a graph showing the price relationship click on: http://int1.fp.sandpiper.net/reuters/editorial/images/20080502/ Ricevswht.gif ""Rice prices have overshot, but it is partly an adjustment of rice prices in relation to wheat prices,"" said Nobuyuki Chino, president of Unipac Grain, based in Tokyo. Wheat, at the moment, is about one-third the price of rice, a gap that may widen before it narrows again. STRANGE RELATIONSHIP On the surface, the relationship is a strange one. Wheat and rice rarely vie for the same crop land. While most rice is grown and consumed in very wet areas of Asia, production of wheat is more widespread around the world, mostly grown on drier land that would be inhospitable to rice. Most consumers are also unlikely to switch between the two, although analysts say sustained higher prices could shift demand at the margins, particularly in countries with larger impoverished populations to feed. ""A lot of Asian countries are importers of wheat, so there could be some substitution,"" said Darren Cooper, senior economist with London-based International Grains Council. ""...particularly in a country like Indonesia, they import quite a lot of wheat."" In Japan, the world's fourth-largest wheat importer, the government is campaigning to encourage households to eat more rice, of which it has more than enough, instead of noodles or bread, which require imported wheat. Aid organizations, which usually work on tight budgets, would also prefer to distribute wheat instead of rice. ""They obviously have a fixed budget, so they will go for a cheaper substitute,"" said one Singapore-based grains trader. ""As a result (of high price), whatever rice was going (in aid) may also stop."" Still those quantities are small. The World Food Programme bought just over 2 million tonnes of food last year, of which rice was about 15 percent while wheat and wheat flour were 23 percent. The world's combined output of rice and wheat is around 1 billion tonnes a year, although only about 135 million tonnes of that is freely traded on the global market. On top of that, the fundamental differences in the way rice and wheat trade makes any near-term correction difficult. Global wheat prices are determined on the CBOT futures exchange, where traders are already anticipating a strong rebound in supplies this year. Rice prices are determined in the opaque, over-the-counter physical market in Bangkok, meaning prices are unlikely to fall too far until new crops are delivered. In the longer-term, however, wheat prices may ultimately find their equilibrium at a higher price relative to rice, as rising income levels in China, India and elsewhere in Asia drive up consumption of protein-rich meat at the expense of rice. ""The gradual increase in the numbers of middle class who demand more meat-based food that requires cereals rather than rice for the feed,"" said one London-based grains analyst who declined to be named."

Recent international series between the two countries have been marred by a number of unsavoury on-field incidents involving top players from both sides. But Hayden said the IPL, in which cricketers from various countries line up alongside each other in a Twenty20 format, had brought players closer together.

en.15.65.8.2008.5.2,April US auto sales plunge 14 percent,"DETROIT, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US auto sales fell 14 percent to their lowest annual rate in a decade in April as weak consumer confidence and rising gas prices hit the industry's most profitable vehicles hardest. General Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC posted deeper sales declines than expected, led by a sharp drop in trucks and SUVs. GM sales fell 23 percent, Ford 19 percent, and Chrysler nearly 30 percent, the automakers said on Thursday. Asian competitors also struggled, with Toyota Motor Corp posting a 5 percent decline, and Nissan Motor Co sales dropping almost 2 percent. Auto sales represent one of the first monthly snapshots of U.S. consumer demand, and investors have looked to the reports for evidence of whether the U.S. economy has slipped further toward recession since the start of the year. The returns were bleak. ""Almost no one buys new vehicles because they have to, they want to. And in order to want to they have to feel good about their future,"" said Erich Merkle, director of forecasting for consulting firm IRN Inc. ""That's just not the case today."" Overall US sales fell to about 14.4 million units on an annualized and seasonally adjusted basis in April, marking the worst result for the industry since August 1998, according to Autodata Corp. Of equal concern to automakers, buyers defected from high-margin trucks and SUVs to cheaper and more fuel-efficient cars more rapidly than expected due to high gasoline prices. Cars accounted for 53 percent of sales in April with light trucks near 47 percent, a nearly complete reversal of the share of the categories a year earlier, according to Autodata. The market shift toward cars has favored Japanese automakers with more established small car offerings. By contrast, the trend has pummeled the truck-heavy lineups of Detroit-based automakers with the average price of regular unleaded gasoline punching above $3.62 per gallon on Thursday, a record high, according to AAA. The three Detroit-based automakers had just a 48 percent share of the world's largest vehicle market in April, down 5 percentage points from a year earlier. But even Toyota, now the world's largest automaker and No. 2 in the US market, faced pressure in April as a decline in its truck sales more than offset gains for small cars like the Yaris and the Prius hybrid. EXPECTATIONS UNDER PRESSURE In recent weeks, all major automakers have scaled back expectations for 2008 US auto industry sales. ""They are doing OK relatively speaking with their cars and crossovers, but that is not going to really help their bottom line since they tend to make the majority of their profits from SUVs and trucks still,"" Jesse Toprak, an analyst at industry tracking firm Edmunds.com, said of the US carmakers. Toprak said he does not expect a dramatic change in consumer-buying patterns for the rest of the year given the overhang of high gas prices and weak consumer confidence. First-quarter US auto sales fell to a 15.2 million annual rate, and both Ford and GM said they now expect the current quarter to mark the trough of the downturn. Toyota expects sales in the low 15-million unit range for 2008 as a whole, down from 16.1 million a year earlier and its own forecast for an almost-flat year for the industry. Automakers sold about 1.25 million vehicles in April, down almost 14 percent after adjusting for two additional sales days last month compared with a year earlier and seasonal factors. Results for the major automakers were reported on that basis, the measure favored by Wall Street analysts. Honda Motor Co Ltd delayed full sales results due to a technical problem, but said April sales rose about 6 percent before adjustment. Automakers have held out hope that a US fiscal stimulus and interest rate cuts would support auto sales in the second half of the year. GM still expects a second-half recovery, but probably less robust than it thought at the start of 2008. The automaker also is fighting through a strike at parts maker American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc that has cut deeply into production of SUVs and trucks. Overall, automakers increased their sales incentives by about 2 percent in April from a year earlier to an average of $2,449 per vehicle, according to Edmunds. That figure is heavily weighted toward large trucks. Year-over-year, incentives at Chrysler and Nissan declined, Ford's rose slightly, and GM, Honda and Toyota were up, according to Edmunds"
en.15.65.191.2008.5.4,Army asking Phulbari people to leave project site: activist alleges,"Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  A citizens' organisation campaigning to protect national resources Sunday alleged that army personnel had been intimidating the people of Phulbari to leave the coalmine project area. ""The survey by military personnel in the area sparked panic among people,"" Professor Anu Muhammad, member secretary of the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports, claimed at a press conference in Purana Paltan. The organisation demanded that the Phulbari coalmine project be scrapped in line with a pledge an elected government had made two years ago. It also demanded expulsion of London-based energy firm Asia Energy from Bangladesh and cancellation of export-focused production and distribution agreements. Contacted by bdnews24.com, Phulbari upazila nirbahi officer AKM Shamim Akter said: ""Locals informed me about the matter. It is completely a matter of the army. I have nothing to say."" Two local businessmen said the army personnel asked them 19 questions about the coalmine but added that they had not coerced them into supporting them. Anu Muhammad, who teaches economics at Jahangirnagar University, claimed that the British government had kept up pressure on Bangladesh to implement the Phulbari coalmine project. On the army survey, he alleged: ""Some army personnel in uniform are travelling the area and asking the people whether they would agree to leave the village in return for compensation."" He asked the government to immediately settle the long-drawn issue. ""The government can conduct any survey. But military uniform sparks panic among people. A survey cannot be conducted this way,"" he said. The campaign activist said the survey was carried out in a village next to the Phulbari town. The Dinajpur district administration, which was informed of the matter, said it would enquire about it. Army officers said they wanted to protect national resources. Anu Muhammad said people of the country treated army as a neutral force. ""The people will never accept it if the armed forces were used against them to allow foreign companies to loot their property."" He alleged that Asia Energy threw up shady organisations that use journalists, consultants and former bureaucrats for its benefit. ""It is trying to buy newspapers by giving advertisements and to make agents by alluring them into lucrative propositions."" The convener of the organisation, Muhammad Shahidullah, said army personnel had been asking the people if they were ready to leave the area with compensation. They had put pressure on the inhabitants for a direct answer, he alleged. The army men were allegedly asking shopkeepers in Phulbari if they paid toll to the national committee. Shahidullah alleged that the local administration of Phulbari was scared. ""If anybody goes there, detectives follow him."" Anu Muhammad claimed to have been barred from going to Birampur. There is no need to conduct a survey over Phulbari. The people have already given their verdict."" On the agreement on Phulbari coalmine, he said that there was no such agreement that could not be scrapped. Shahidullah vowed that their movement against Asia Energy would continue. He said up to 80 lakh cubic feet of gas was being destroyed every day in Titas gasfield. ""US energy firm Chevron owes Bangladesh at least Tk 9,000 crore because of Magurchhara explosion. But this government like the previous government has taken no steps to realise the money.

en.15.65.50.2008.5.1,April Iraq`s deadliest month since last August,"Baghdad, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fighting in Baghdad's Shi'ite slum of Sadr City made April the deadliest month for Iraqi civilians since last August and for US troops since last September, figures obtained on Wednesday showed. Iraqi Health Ministry figures showed 968 civilian deaths in April, the most in eight months. On Wednesday the U.S. military reported the deaths of five more of its soldiers in Baghdad, raising its monthly toll to 49. Most of the US and Iraqi deaths were in the capital, where U.S. and government forces have been fighting Shi'ite militants loyal to anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in the tightly-packed Sadr City slum and other Shi'ite areas. US forces said they killed another 16 fighters in gunfights, tank battles and strikes from drone aircraft, following heavy fighting on Tuesday in which they killed 34. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who launched a crackdown against Sadr's Mehdi Army militia a month ago in the southern city of Basra, said on Wednesday the government would disarm the fighters by force if they refuse to lay down their weapons. Two hospitals in Sadr City said they alone had received the bodies of 421 Iraqis killed and treated more than 2,400 wounded since late March. Many of the dead and wounded have been civilians, caught in the crossfire in the crowded slum. Some of the heaviest fighting has taken place in the past three days, with militiamen taking advantage of blinding dust storms that ground U.S. attack helicopters to launch large-scale ambushes of US and Iraqi positions. US forces have responded with tank fire and surface-to-surface missiles, destroying buildings. Thirty-four bodies and 112 wounded victims were brought to the two Sadr City hospitals in the last 24 hours, hospital officials said. US forces reported three soldiers killed in Baghdad overnight and another two killed on Wednesday afternoon. April's US death toll is the highest since September 2007, when 65 US soldiers died in Iraq, according to official figures tracked by icasualties.org, an independent website. The tolls for both soldiers and civilians are still far lower than a year ago, however. In April 2007, 104 U.S. service members and 1,506 Iraqi civilians were killed. US commanders say the sectarian violence between Sunni Arabs and Shi'ites that characterized earlier years remains sharply lower. But the uprising by Shi'ite militia over the past month has reversed a long trend of declining violence. MALIKI SETS CONDITIONS Maliki aimed some of his toughest language yet at the Shi'ite fighters on Wednesday, singling out the Mehdi Army by name and grouping it with Sunni Arab groups like al Qaeda as organizations that must be dissolved. He set down four conditions -- that militias disarm, stop interfering in state affairs, stop running their own courts and hand over wanted fugitives -- or face a military assault. ""To refuse these conditions means the continuation of the government's efforts to disarm them by force,"" Maliki said at a news conference inside Baghdad's fortified Green Zone government and diplomatic compound. ""There is no alternative to these conditions. The alternative is the continuation of force and clashes until we reach the end, to get rid of the weapons and the gangs who are carrying weapons."" Maliki, himself a Shi'ite, launched a crackdown against Mehdi Army fighters last month in the southern city of Basra. After initial setbacks, the Basra offensive appears to have been a success in driving fighters from the streets there. But the militiamen remain in control of much of Baghdad's Sadr City"
en.15.65.341.2008.5.1,"IBM launches ""green energy"" tools for data centers","SAN FRANCISCO, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N: Quote, Profile, Research) on Wednesday launched tools to reduce computer energy consumption as IBM hopes to boost its business of selling power-saving technologies. The products, announced at an IBM business-partner conference in Los Angeles, are designed to measure power consumption and reduction across energy-hungry computer data centers that run corporate networks and Web sites. The world's largest technology services company is offering software that tracks and caps data-center energy consumption, including power for air conditioning to cool server computers. IBM is also extending to 27 more countries a program begun in seven countries last year that lets companies earn and trade certificates awarded for verified energy savings. ""Energy efficiency has become a critical business metric, like product reliability and customer satisfaction,"" William Zeitler, head of IBM's systems and technology group, said in an interview with Reuters. IBM is expanding in so-called green data centers as it looks for new growth areas in developed regions such as Western Europe as well as in developing countries that are spending heavily on new technology infrastructure. ""The opportunity for us is to go to clients -- there are an enormous number who are either transforming their data centers or will have to transform them,"" Zeitler said. ""This is a critically important problem in the industry."" IBM's green data center initiative has already begun to pay off a year after it was launched. It generated nearly $200 million of technology-services contract signings in the first quarter and about $300 million in the fourth, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said in recent earnings presentations. Many of the countries added to the certificate program are in emerging markets in Asia and the Middle East, where Armonk, New York-based IBM has been generating double-digit percentage revenue growth from building technology infrastructure in telecoms, transportation and energy, among other areas. Growth is also strong in North America and Western Europe, where banks, for example, are trying to rein in energy costs from running massive volumes of financial transactions on their computers. Banks are among IBM's biggest customers. ""It's really taken off in North America in particular and Western Europe,"" said Joe Clabby, president and industry research analyst at Clabby Analytics. ""Countries that are not energy self-sufficient are jumping on this initiative."""

Turnover and the trading volume also followed the pattern of a fall over the week and a rise on Apr 30, the last trading day. The week saw four trading days as May 1 was a national holiday. Total turnover for the week amounted to Tk 10 .84 billion while the daily average turnover recorded a 23.22 percent increase over the previous week to Tk 2.71 billion. Market analysts said investors were engaged in mixed buying and selling over the week as there was a bit of liquidity crisis in the market. As merchant banks are maintaining a cautious stance about issuing margin loans, the market is running a bit short of liquidity, investment consultant Bashir Ahmed of Stocks and Bonds told bdnews24com. ""This led the investors to engage in mixed buying and selling over the week,"" he added. An official of a merchant bank preferring anonymity said they were not issuing loans at the 1:1 ratio fixed by the market regulator. ""Merchant banks are cautious about issuing loans nowadays. There is a risk of market overheating if loans are disbursed profusely,"" he told bdnews24.com. Most bankers are providing loans at the 1:0.5 ratio, the official said. Meanwhile, market observers lauded the merchant banks' behaviour and said that they were acting responsibly. ""We have seen that investors, especially retail ones, overheat the market by putting money in undervalued scrips,"" said Dhaka Stock Exchange's chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed. ""From this point of view, I would say that the merchant banks are behaving responsibly,"" he added. The benchmark DGEN or general index was at 3079.35 on the opening day and fell 6.5 points or 0.21 percent to 3072.85 on the closing day while the DSI or all-share price index also fell 6.34 points or 0.24 percent from the opening day to finish at 2593.26 on Wednesday. Market capitalisation witnessed a 0.19 percent decline to Tk 855.22 billion on the closing day from Tk 856.89 billion on Sunday. AB Bank, UCBL, Square Pharma, ACI and IFIC Bank topped the week's turnover board. Net asset value declarations of Investment Corporation of Bangladesh and its mutual funds led them to dominate the top 10 gainers along with Z category issue Bangladesh Luggage. The week's major events included unearthing a shady website by the Securities and Exchange Commission offering stock market consultancy to investors in violation of the securities laws. SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed told a press briefing on Apr 29 that the site contains information on which issues to rise at what pace in next-day trade and asks investors to buy the scrips to gain windfalls. The SEC official however declined to disclose the name of the website. ""I cannot say it now as an investigation is ongoing,"" he said. Solicitation services without the consent of the capital market regulator are illegal, according to the law. ""If someone is permitted to operate as a financial analyst, he cannot pass on this information to the public. Consultancy must be client-specific,"" said the SEC official. The regulator thinks that those who are behind the initiative have an intention to manipulate the market. SEC's top priority was to shut down such activities, according to Farhad. Meanwhile, the market regulator is formulating a guideline for establishing the branch offices of brokerage houses and decided to lift the ""circuit breaker"" on the post-record day trading of an issue. The SEC also raised validity of licence renewal of authorised representatives of brokerage houses to five years from the existing one year in a bid to cut administrative hassles. The decisions came at a meeting of the commission on Tuesday, according to the SEC official. ""The purpose of making a guideline for branch offices of brokerage houses is to ensure that investors enjoy equal security,"" Farhad said. bdn"

The operation began just before midnight and continued into Friday, Anatolian said. Military sources told Reuters that at least 30 planes were bombing the area, which they said was far from civilian settlements. The raids, expected to last several hours, were aimed against senior PKK members in the Qandil area of northern Iraq, the sources said. Turkish air strikes inside Iraq the past week were described by Iraq as ""unfortunate"". Turkish troops conducted a large-scale incursion across the border in February.

en.15.65.127.2008.5.5,Clinton dismisses `elite' economists on gas tax plan,"Washington, Sun May 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Sunday dismissed the ""elite opinion"" of economists who criticized her gas tax proposal, using a term that has dogged rival Barack Obama in recent weeks. Obama, meanwhile, accused the New York senator of pandering on gas taxes and saber rattling toward Iran as both candidates gave television interviews before primary contests in North Carolina and Indiana. The two are battling to be their party's nominee to face Republican John McCain in November's election. Appearing on ABC's ""This Week,"" Clinton said it was time to move beyond the controversy surrounding Obama's former pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright. ""We should definitely move on,"" the New York senator said in response to a question from the audience. ""We should move on because there's so many important issues facing our country that we have to attend to."" Clinton raised questions about Obama's ability to connect with working-class Americans while dismissing economists who have said her plan to suspend gas taxes over the summer would do little good. ""I'm not going to put my lot in with economists,"" Clinton said when asked to name an economist who backed her proposal. ""We've got to get out of this mind-set where somehow elite opinion is always on the side of doing things that really disadvantage the vast majority of Americans,"" said Clinton, a former first lady who would be the first woman president. Critics have painted Obama as elitist for a comment he made about job losses causing some small-town Americans to become bitter and to cling to guns and religion. That perception hurt the Illinois senator in the big blue-collar state of Pennsylvania, where Clinton won a crucial victory last month in the protracted Democratic contest. The two candidates next square off in primaries in North Carolina and Indiana on Tuesday. Polls close by 7 p.m. EDT/2300 GMT in Indiana and by 7:30 p.m. EDT/2330 GMT in North Carolina. Results are expected shortly after. 'WASHINGTON GIMMICK' In an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Obama dismissed Clinton's gas-tax proposal as ""a classic Washington gimmick"" that has no chance of becoming law. ""What this is is a strategy to get through the next election,"" he said. Obama acknowledged he should have more quickly distanced himself from his former pastor who has suggested the U.S. government created AIDS to kill blacks and the September 11 attacks were payback for U.S. foreign policy. He did not repudiate Wright completely until last week, after the Chicago preacher reiterated his views. ""When you're in national politics, it's always good to pull the Band-aid off quick,"" Obama said. ""But life's messy sometimes, it's not always neat, and things don't always proceed in textbook Political 101 fashion."" Obama launched a new ad slamming Clinton's gas tax plan. ""Clinton aides admit it won't do much for you, but would help her politically,"" the ad's announcer says. Clinton aides said the spot was misleading because a person cited in the Obama ad was actually criticizing McCain, not Clinton. Opinion polls show Obama losing ground to Clinton in Indiana and North Carolina during the past several weeks. He now leads Clinton by an average of 7 points in North Carolina and trails her by an average of 6 points in Indiana. Obama spent the afternoon campaigning door-to-door in Elkhart, Indiana, where much of the talk was about high gas prices. One woman said it cost $4 to mow her lawn. Clinton, meanwhile, encouraged supporters in Fort Wayne, Indiana, to help get people to the polls on Tuesday. She has spent $6.7 million in the two states, according to her campaign aides, while Obama has spent $10.5 million. On Saturday night, Obama eked out a narrow seven-vote victory in the US Pacific island territory of Guam"

Hudson, 29, daughter of actress Goldie Hawn, told the magazine that she can't remember the last time she had a manicure or a facial. ""I don't do those kinds of things. And when I do, I always think, 'I should do this more often,'"" she said. Joining her on the list, which People said is not ranked, are teen queens Miley Cyrus, of ""Hannah Montana"" fame, and ""High School Musical"" star Vanessa Hudgens, who have both been criticized for appearing in sexy or nude photographs. ""Just recently I've learned to be okay with myself without wearing makeup,"" said Hudgens, whose image took a battering when nude pictures of her appeared on the Internet last year. New moms Isla Fisher, Salma Hayek, Jennifer Lopez and Halle Berry -- on the list for the 12th time -- are named, along with mothers-to-be Jessica Alba, Angelina Jolie, making her sixth appearance, and Nicole Kidman, named for the ninth time. Jolie's partner Brad Pitt is named for the eighth time, along with George Clooney, while Matthew McConaughey makes it for the fifth time. From the music business, Carrie Underwood, Mary J.

United's estimated operating income was $111 million, $1 million behind Real Madrid, which was valued at $1.285 billion, according to Forbes, which values the top clubs annually. By comparison, the most valuable U.S. professional sports team is the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys, which Forbes valued at $1.5 billion last September. Not surprisingly, the magazine estimated British soccer star David Beckham, who plays for U.S.-based Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy, was ranked as the highest earning player at $49 million. He previously played for both United and Real Madrid. United, known as the Red Devils, are the reigning English Premier League champions, and reached the European Champions League final on Tuesday. The club is owned by U.S. businessman Malcolm Glazer, who bought the team in 2005 and also owns the U.S. football Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Four of the clubs in the top 10 are from the English Premier League, considered the richest soccer league in the world. The top 10 also includes two clubs each from Spain, Germany and Italy. Forbes values teams based on what they have sold for in the past relative to sales and profits, broadcast agreements and debt from new and pending stadium deals. Rounding out the top-five list of valued soccer clubs were Arsenal (with a value of $1.2 billion), followed by Liverpool ($1.05 billion) and Bayern Munich ($917 million), according to Forbes. The second five were AC Milan ($798 million), Barcelona ($784 million), Chelsea ($764 million), Italy's Juventus ($510 million) and Germany's Schalke 04 ($470 million), according to Forbes. Forbes also reported that Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, completed in 2006 at a cost of $860 million with a capacity of 60,432, is a gold mine, generating $6 million a game. That tops the $5 million per game United gets from Old Trafford, the only larger stadium in England's Premier League, according to the magazine. It seats 76,000"
en.15.65.293.2008.5.2,Al Jazeera cameraman released from Guantanamo,"Dubai, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Al Jazeera cameraman held at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay for six years without charge has been released, the network said on Thursday. Sudanese-born Sami al-Haj, who suffered health problems after a long hunger strike, arrived in the Sudanese capital Khartoum early on Friday aboard a U.S. military plane, the Qatar-based broadcaster said. The Pentagon was not immediately available for comment, but a senior U.S. defense official in Washington speaking on condition of anonymity said: ""He's not being released. He's being transferred to the Sudanese government."" Al Jazeera said Haj was seized by Pakistani intelligence officers while traveling near the Afghan border in December 2001, despite holding a legitimate visa to work for Al Jazeera's Arabic channel in Afghanistan. Haj, who had been accused of making videos of Osama bin Laden, was handed to the U.S. military in January 2002 but was never charged or brought to trial, the network said. ""His detention for six years, without the most basic due process, is a grave injustice and represents a threat to all journalists working in conflict areas,"" said Joel Simon, executive director of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. HUNGER STRIKE Al Jazeera said Haj had been on a hunger strike since January 2007 and had been force-fed through his nose twice a day while strapped down. Sudan's Justice Minister Abdel Basit Sabderat said Washington had already had enough time to produce any evidence against Haj and that Khartoum had no plans of holding him. ""As minister of justice I am not aware of any accusations against Sami al-Haj ... that would stand between him and his freedom,"" he told Al Jazeera. Al Jazeera showed footage of Haj being carried to hospital in a stretcher and said two other Sudanese were also released. ""We have to be happy but also sad over our brothers (still being held),"" Haj told Al Jazeera by telephone. He accused Guantanamo authorities of repeated violations of the Muslim prisoners' religious sensitivities. Haj's attorney, Zachary Katznelson, said: ""We don't believe there is any reason that would justify detaining Sami in Sudan even for one single day."" Wadah Khanfar, Al Jazeera's director general who is in Khartoum to welcome Haj, accused the U.S. military of urging the cameraman to spy on the operations at the network. ""We are concerned about the way the Americans dealt with Sami, and we are concerned about the way they could deal with others as well,"" he said in a report on the Al Jazeera website english.aljazeera.net. ""Sami will continue with Al Jazeera."" BBC reporter Alan Johnston, who was kidnapped and held for months in the Gaza strip, wrote to Haj last year to express his support and thank the cameraman for an appeal he made to the Gaza kidnappers to release him. Haj made a public appeal to Johnston's kidnappers in March last year, saying: ""While the United States has kidnapped me and held me for years on end, this is not a lesson that Muslims should copy."" There are several hundred detainees at Guantanamo. The first prisoners arrived nearly six years ago after the United States began what U.S. President George W. Bush called a war on terrorism in response to the September 11 attacks by bin Laden's al Qaeda network in 2"
en.15.65.319.2008.5.3,U.S. job cuts in April less severe than feared,"WASHINGTON, May 2 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Fewer U.S. jobs were lost in April than economists feared and the unemployment rate unexpectedly improved, raising hopes an economic downturn was not gathering steam as the second quarter opened. The Labor Department said on Friday that 20,000 jobs were shed last month, far fewer than the 80,000 that economists had anticipated. The national unemployment rate fell to 5 percent from 5.1 percent in March. ""The economy is just barely treading water,"" said Richard Yamarone, chief economist for Argus Research in New York, after the jobs figures were issued. ""It's not imploding but it's not desirable either."" Stock investors were heartened by the jobs report, driving equities prices higher, but bond prices fell on the belief it raised chances the Federal Reserve will be able to extend a pause in its rate-cutting campaign. The dollar's value gained against other key currencies on the possibility that interest rates will not keep falling. FACTORY ORDERS JUMP A report at mid-morning from the Commerce Department, showing a stronger-than-expected 1.4 percent rise in March factory orders, added to the positive market tone. Forecasts had called for only a slight 0.2 percent rise in March orders. The report also showed, though, that inventories of unsold manufactured goods climbed to the highest level since the department started records in 1992. Attention was focused on the April jobs report, however, since it is one of the first looks at second-quarter performance and came amid lingering fears the economy is at heightened risk of slipping into recession. April's job reductions followed upwardly revised losses of 81,000 jobs in March and 83,000 in February. Employers also cut 76,000 jobs in January. Though the losses in jobs last month were less than forecast, they nonetheless represent continued deterioration in hiring prospects. The four-month string of monthly losses is the longest since a five-month stretch in 2003, when the economy was still in a so-called jobless recovery from the last recession in 2001. In a telephone interview, Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez described the report as ""bittersweet"" since it still reflects a weaker job environment. ""I'm just so glad that we are right in the middle of sending out economic stimulus checks to consumers right now that should spur activity,"" he said. CHECKS IN THE MAIL The Bush administration began making direct deposits this week of up to $600 for individuals and $1,200 for couples as part of an economic stimulus program approved by Congress earlier this year. Analysts said the moderation in the pace of job losses added to hopes that the economic downturn may be less severe than thought, provided that a credit-market seizure can be avoided. ""What you get a sense of is that people have been coming into this in recent months with the idea that this was a horrendous recessionary calamity, and I think what we're coming to find out is that this looks more like a mid-cycle slowdown,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer for Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. John Silvia, an economist with Wachovia Bank in Charlotte, N.C., said the jobs data gave the Fed some breathing-room to assess the impact of substantial rate cuts it already has made. ""I think the employment decline was less than expected and consistent with a modest slowdown in the U.S. economy, possibly a recession, and I think it will allow the Fed time to look at the data going forward,"" Silvia said. Just before the April employment figures were issued, the Fed announced fresh action to add liquidity to credit markets, increasing the size of some cash auctions for financial institutions as well. The Labor Department said 61,000 construction jobs were lost in April, the largest number for that sector since 103,000 were cut in February 2007. The department said since peaking in September 2006, some 457,000 construction jobs have been lost. Goods-producing businesses cut 110,000 jobs in April, the largest number of job reductions since January 2002, after trimming 88,000 in March. But service industries added 90,000 jobs -- the most since last December -- with most of them coming in the health care and professional technical services sectors. Both the number of hours worked and overtime hours weakened slightly in April from March, a sign employers were making every effort to keep a tight lid on employment cost"
en.15.65.153.2008.5.4,US puts faith in new roads to build Afghan security,"Khost, Afghanistan, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - On the face of it, there are not many similarities between battling cocaine kingpins in South America and fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. But for Major Dan Morgan, who runs US military operations in a large swathe of east Afghanistan and once worked in drug enforcement in Colombia, there is one unifying factor -- roads. In Colombia, when his team tried to wean locals away from coca leaves to grow crops like bananas instead, they realized it was only going to work if they built roads linking the banana plantations to local towns so the produce could be sold. In Afghanistan, where so much of the country is semi-lawless and inaccessible, trying to draw communities away from the influence of the Taliban again depends on building roads, so that locals can easily reach markets and join the economy. ""When it comes down to it, roads are very, very significant,"" Morgan, the brigade operations officer for a task force of the 101st Airborne Division, said in an interview. ""If you have a paved road here, you have fewer IEDs,"" he said, referring to the deadly roadside bombs the Taliban and other militants use to target U.S. and Afghan convoys. ""Once you have a road you can also get Afghan forces to where they need to be more quickly, which improves security. As some have said: where a road ends, instability begins."" The problem is, building roads takes time and costs huge amounts of money, up to $250,000 per kilometer for asphalt, according to U.S. engineers. And U.S. or Afghan forces need to impose security in an area before construction can begin. In the remote regions of eastern Afghanistan along the border with Pakistan, where the Taliban have traditionally been strong, linking isolated goat-herding communities with larger towns by road could take years -- not to mention the difficulty of building at altitudes of up to 12,000 feet. And all the time the Taliban are vying for the loyalty of the community, trying to shut out the influence of the Americans and the slowly improving Afghan National Army. ""It's not quick, that's for sure,"" said Morgan. ""It takes vision and it takes tactical patience. At the end of the day, 99 percent of the operations our brigade is working on are non-lethal."" SPRING THREAT? While U.S. forces may not be seeing much major combat in the area Morgan oversees, they are heavily engaged in the south, where hundreds of U.S. Marines were last week deployed to take on the Taliban in Helmand province, the main base for more than 7,000 British troops serving as part of a NATO-led force. U.S. troops are also under pressure directly east of Kabul, along the Pakistan border, where militants filter across to carry out attacks, and where a suicide bomber last week killed more than a dozen people south of the city of Jalalabad. Now that winter has passed and the trails over the mountains between Pakistan and Afghanistan are more accessible, US forces are also bracing for an upsurge in militant attacks -- the type of spring offensive that has been seen in the past. So far US commanders say they have seen little uppick in the number of Taliban sneaking over the frontier, and Morgan says most infiltration points in his 24,000-square-mile (62,000-square-km) area are now secured by Afghan units or US special forces. But a potential peace deal between Pakistan's new government and Taliban in the country's northwest, along the Afghan border, could mean those militants turning away from fighting Pakistan security forces and focusing attention over the border. If that were to happen, US forces could find themselves with more of a fight on their hands, and projects such as road building may have to take more of a back seat. ""It's a definite concern,"" Morgan said of the possibility of a Spring offensive. ""If it's going to happen, it's going to start happening now. ""We're prepared to defend ourselves ... My job is about getting a balance between lethal and non-lethal operations."
en.15.65.130.2008.5.4,Bush says rebate checks will boost ailing economy,"CRAWFORD, Texas, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush sought to assure Americans on Saturday that federal checks en route to them as part of a stimulus plan will help spur the ailing economy and pay for soaring gas and food prices. ""These rebates will deliver up to $600 per person, $1,200 per couple, and $300 per child,"" Bush said in his weekly radio address. ""This package will help American families increase their purchasing power and help offset the high prices that we're seeing at the gas pump and the grocery store,"" Bush said, adding it would also provide tax incentives for business to invest and create jobs. Bush spoke as he began a weekend at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, and a day after the U.S. Labor Department reported that 20,000 jobs were shed in April, far fewer than the 80,000 that many economists had anticipated would be lost. At the same time, the national unemployment rate fell to 5 percent from 5.1 percent in March. Amid the mixed economic news, fiscal jitters remained. In his radio address, Bush tried to ease concerns about the economy, which have replaced the Iraq war as the top issue among Americans as they get ready to elect a successor to the unpopular president in November. Bush touted the $150 billion economic stimulus package that he signed into law after it was passed with bipartisan support in the Democratic-led Congress. ""This week, the main piece of that package began being implemented, as nearly 7.7 million Americans received their tax rebates,"" Bush said. ""Next week, the Treasury Department will begin mailing checks to millions more."" But the president blasted Democrats for failing to do more, particularly in dealing with the housing mortgage crisis and rising food and energy prices. In the Democrats' radio response, Rep. Andre Carson of Indiana pinned much of the blame for the economic woes on what he described as Bush's misguided war without end in Iraq.

""If we took even a fraction of the billions of dollars we spend in Iraq and used them here at home, we could make real progress and help get our nation out of our economic slump,"" he said.

en.15.65.475.2008.5.3,Central banks extend liquidity lifeline to markets,"WASHINGTON/FRANKFURT, May 2 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Major central banks on Friday announced larger liquidity injections in a bid to wrestle down market interest rates as they extended joint efforts to tackle stubborn tensions on money markets. The Federal Reserve said it would step up the amounts offered in some cash auctions to financial institutions, while the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank will boost their auctions of U.S. dollar funds for European banks. It is the third phase of coordinated liquidity action to be announced since last December, when some money market rates were nearing their highest levels in seven years. ""In view of the persistent liquidity pressures in some term funding markets, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank are announcing an expansion of their liquidity measures,"" the three central banks said in statements. The Fed will also widen the scope of assets it accepts as collateral in its Term Securities Lending Facility auctions, while in a separate measure, the Bank of England will allow British banks to hold more funds at the central bank, giving them greater scope to meet liquidity needs on any given day. The moves follow a steady increase in the interest rates banks charge for lending to each other, reflecting a wish to hold on to cash for extra security as well as concerns about counterparty exposure to bad investments in the wake of nine months of market upheavals. London interbank offered rates for three-month euro funds chalked up their 12th straight weekly increase on Friday and although LIBOR rates for three-month dollar and sterling funds eased, market rates remain well above official central bank borrowing costs and the cost of risk-free money. The Fed said it was increasing the amounts offered in its Term Auction Facility auctions, held every two weeks, to $75 billion from $50 billion, beginning with an auction on May 5. It also said it was increasing an existing temporary currency swap line with the ECB to $50 billion, from $30 billion, and increasing a swap line with the SNB to $12 billion from $6 billion. The timeframe for the swap lines will also be extended until the end of January 2009. The ECB, which has held seven auctions of U.S. dollars so far, will extend the amount of cash available at each auction to $25 billion, from $15 billion so far. It will hold auctions every two weeks, as it has since late March. The SNB will increase the frequency of its U.S. dollar auctions to fortnightly, but maintain the same upper limit of $6 billion per auction. Both the ECB and SNB said they would keep providing extra U.S. dollar liquidity for as long as needed. The Bank of England said it did not see any shortage of U.S. dollar liquidity and therefore was not participating in the plan. In addition to expanding the size of its auctions, the Fed will widen the scope of acceptable collateral for Term Securities Lending Facility loans to include AAA-rated asset-backed securities. Like its long-standing discount window lending operations, it already accepted U.S. Treasury and agency securities and agency mortgage-backed securitie"
en.15.65.331.2008.5.4,Shuttle reaches launch pad for May 31 liftoff,"HOUSTON, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Space shuttle Discovery reached its Cape Canaveral, Florida, launch pad on Saturday in preparation for a May 31 liftoff to place a huge Japanese research complex on the International Space Station. With the shuttle in position, NASA will hold a practice launch countdown with the seven-member crew next week. The mission is the third of five planned for this year. NASA has 10 shuttle flights remaining to the $100 billion space station before the fleet is to be retired in 2010. The U.S. space agency also plans a final servicing call to the Hubble Space Telescope this fall. The shuttles, which were designed in the 1970s, are being retired due to safety issues and to pay for the development of new spaceships that are capable of traveling to the moon as well as low-Earth orbit. NASA estimates the country will need to depend on Russian space transports to ferry station crewmembers to and from the station for about five years while the new ships are under construction. Discovery's crew, led by Mark Kelly, includes five first-time fliers and two veterans. Kelly has made two previous spaceflights and lead spacewalker Michael Fossum, has flown once. The crew includes Japan's Akihiko Hoshide, who will oversee the initial setup of Kibo, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency's primary contribution to the space station. Also aboard will be pilot Ken Ham, spacewalker Ron Garan, Karen Nyberg and space station flight engineer Greg Chamitoff, who will replace Garrett Reisman as a member of the live-aboard space station crew. NASA delivered a storage compartment for Kibo during its last shuttle mission in March. A final segment of the elaborate lab, an exposed back porch for microgravity research experiments, is due to arrive next year."
en.15.65.464.2008.5.4,Myanmar cyclone death toll 'at 243',"London, May 04, (bdnews24.com/BBC) - A tropical cyclone has killed at least 243 people in Myanmar and damaged thousands of buildings, according to state television. Parts of the Irrawaddy region were hit particularly badly, with three out of four buildings reportedly blown down in one district. Myanmar has declared Irrawaddy and four other regions, including the main city Yangon, to be disaster areas. Yangon has been without power and water, its streets full of debris. Winds of about 190km/h (120mph) battered the Irrawaddy, Yangon, Bago, Karen and Mon regions. Military and police personnel have been carrying out rescue operations. Cyclone Nargis has since moved towards Thailand where storm warnings have been issued. However, it appears to be lessening in force. Phone links down. In Irrawaddy's Labutta township, 75% of buildings collapsed and 20% had their roofs ripped off, state TV said. In the Irrawaddy delta region as a whole, the cyclone brought down more than 20,000 houses. In Yangon, internet and phone connections have been down since the storm drew near, making it difficult to confirm the extent of the damage. Official media report that four people were killed and four vessels sank in the former Burmese capital's harbour. A UN regional official told Reuters news agency it would take several days to assess the scale of the damage. ""There does not seem to be a high number of casualties but for sure there is a lot of damage to property and infrastructure,"" Therje Skavdal said, speaking from Bangkok. 'Like Katrina' One unnamed Rangoon resident described the damage in the city for the BBC Myanmar service. ""Everything was wrecked,"" he said. ""Roofs of the houses and satellite dishes were blown away. Windows were broken at Yuzana Plaza. Roadside billboards were all blown away... Everything is in a mess."" Many roofs were reportedly ripped off even sturdy buildings in Rangoon. ""I have never seen anything like it,"" one retired government worker told Reuters. ""It reminded me of when Hurricane Katrina hit the United States."" A trishaw driver in Yangon, who did not want to be identified, complained that the security forces were not doing enough to help. ""Where are all those uniformed people who are always ready to beat civilians?"" he said. ""They should come out in full force and help clean up the areas and restore electricity."""

en.15.65.46.2008.5.2,Zimbabwe opposition disputes electoral figure,"Harare, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's opposition on Friday disputed results of a March 29 presidential election released by electoral officials, saying opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai had the outright majority needed to avoid a run-off. The official data showed Tsvangirai had 47.9 percent of the vote, beating President Robert Mugabe with 43.2 percent, but short of the majority needed to avoid a run-off ballot with the veteran leader, who has led Zimbabwe since 1980. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change says Tsvangirai got 50.3 percent of the vote. ""We don't agree with their figures. They will have to prove us wrong. We are now going into the verification of those figures,"" said Chris Mbanga, a representative of Movement for Democratic Change leader Morgan Tsvangirai. Election officials released the figures to candidates on Thursday at the start of a verification process after a month-long delay to results that had raised fears of widespread bloodshed in the country suffering economic ruin. The MDC has accused the government of launching a campaign of violence and intimidation ahead of the possible second round and said 20 of its members had been killed by pro-government militias. The government denies carrying out a violent campaign and accuses the MDC of political attacks. Tsvangirai has suggested he could still take part in a second round if international observers led by the United Nations monitored the process. The main international observer group at the first round was from Zimbabwe's neighbors. If Tsvangirai refused to take part in a run-off, Mugabe would be declared the winner, according to election rules. A run-off should be held within 21 days of a result being announced."
en.15.65.149.2008.5.2,Bush proposes $770 million in new food aid,"WASHINGTON May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W. Bush on Thursday called for the United States to offer $770 million in new global food aid in an effort to stem rising food prices threatening to spread social unrest in the developing world. Bush, who has expressed concern at the deepening global food crisis which has triggered turmoil in poor countries, said he wanted to send a clear message that the United States would lead in addressing this problem. ""With the new international funding I'm announcing today we're sending a clear message to the world that America will lead the fight against hunger for years to come,"" Bush said. Sky-rocketing prices for wheat and other staples, along with record-high fuel prices, have eaten into aid budgets in the United States, the world's largest food aid donor, as hunger becomes a growing problem in the developing world. ""I think more needs to be done and so today I'm asking Congress to provide an additional $770 million to support food aid and development programs,"" Bush told reporters at the White House as he unveiled a supplemental budget request for fiscal 2009 that would require congressional approval. Bush's announcement came just two days after he expressed deep concern about the global food crisis. Details on how the new aid money would be spent were not released. U.S. lawmakers and international aid groups have urged the administration to do more to help blunt the toll of surging food prices on the world's poor. Protests, strikes and riots have erupted in developing countries around the world in the wake of dramatic rises in the prices of wheat, rice, corn, oils and other essential foods that have made it difficult for poor people to make ends meet. Bush's budget request for new food aid would be in addition to $200 million approved by Bush last month through the release of 250,000 metric tons of wheat from an emergency crop trust, a step the United States had not taken since 2005. The United States typically provides about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in food aid each year through the U.S. Agency for International Development. The administration has already requested supplemental food aid funding, a perennial addition to annual budget funds, of $350 million for fiscal 2008. ""America is in the lead, we'll stay in the lead and we expect others to participate along with us,"" Bush said. ""We're working with our G8 partners and other developed nations to secure commitments from their governments for additional food aid."""

Gattuso said last week he would consider his future at the end of the season. Milan have struggled this term, lying fourth in Serie A having been knocked out of the Champions League as holders by Arsenal in the last 16. ""Is it true that Gattuso wants to leave Milan? I like him. He would be an important player for Bayern in the Champions League. Or rather he would be perfect,"" Beckenbauer told Wednesday's Gazzetta dello Sport. Another Italian, Luca Toni, has thrilled Bayern this season with 21 league goals in their run to the Bundesliga title. Media reports have reported Milan may be considering a bid but Beckenbauer said Toni was not for sale. ""We are happy with him, very happy in fact. He is a goal machine. Toni will help Bayern to win the Champions League again as soon as possible,"" he said. Beckenbauer also doubted Bayern were looking at Fiorentina goalkeeper Sebastien Frey to replace retiring goalkeeper Oliver Kahn.

en.15.65.90.2008.5.1,US military criticizes Iran but says no strike plan,"Washington, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US military on Wednesday dismissed speculation that it was drafting new plans to attack Iran but again charged Tehran with supporting Iraqi militias and the Taliban in Afghanistan. Lt. Gen. John Sattler, the military's director of strategic plans, said that while the Pentagon had plans on the shelf for numerous potential conflicts around the world, there had been no order for officers to advance new plans for an Iran strike. ""There has been no order, specific order to plan in any particular area of the world,"" Sattler told reporters at the Pentagon. Asked specifically if the military was ordered to plan an Iran strike, he said, ""No."" Sattler's comments come as hostile rhetoric and close encounters in the Gulf have fueled speculation that Washington may be planning some sort of military action against Iran. The appearance of a second US aircraft carrier in the Gulf this week has further fed that concern. The Navy said the presence of two carriers was temporary and part of a routine transition, as one carrier relieves the other in that area. But Lt. Gen. Carter Ham, the military's operations director, said the presence of two carriers was meant to signal the US military's capabilities to the region. Speaking at the same Pentagon news conference, he said it was not a message directed solely at Iran. ""It's a message to all nations that the United States possesses the capability and the will to operate global,"" he said. ""So this is an opportunity to do that."" EVIDENCE TO MALIKI Washington accuses Iran of seeking nuclear weapons under cover of an energy program. It also says Iran fuels violence in Iraq by supporting Shi'ite militias with weapons and training. Tehran rejects both charges and blames violence in Iraq on the presence of U.S. troops. Gen. David Petraeus, the top US general in Iraq, had been expected to lay out publicly new evidence that Iran continues to support Iraqi militias, providing newly made weapons, despite promising Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki that it would halt those activities. But on Wednesday, US defense officials said that evidence was instead given to Iraqi officials with an expectation that Maliki would confront Tehran with the information. ""The Iraqis wish to first show what they have to the Iranian government before they show the world,"" said one defense officials traveling with U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates in Mexico. ""First and foremost, it's an attempt to say: 'Hey, listen, we know what you're up to. This is not helpful. Cut it out!',"" the official said. The US military also raised new accusations of Iranian support for the Taliban in Afghanistan. Ham said the military had evidence that Tehran was continuing to send weapons and material to the Taliban, particularly in western Afghanistan. Previously, US defense officials said Iranian involvement in Afghanistan was limited to a few small arms shipments that ended in August 2007. ""There is indication that the Iranian support of the Taliban has continued,"" Ham said. ""We don't believe it to be at the same level which they have provided fighters and weapons into Iraq, but there is some clear evidence."" He said the number of attacks in Afghanistan was slightly higher than a year ago, but would not provide details"
en.15.65.300.2008.5.7,"Obama wins North Carolina, Clinton leads in Indiana","Washington, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton appeared headed to a split in crucial presidential contests in Indiana and North Carolina on Tuesday, pushing Obama closer to securing the Democratic nomination but keeping Clinton's hopes alive. CBS News projected a Clinton win in Indiana, which would preserve her slender chances in a prolonged Democratic duel that now moves to the next contest in one week in West Virginia. Nearly two hours after the CBS projection for Indiana, other networks had not made a call with nearly 84 percent of the vote counted and Clinton leading 52 percent to 48 percent. The remaining uncounted votes were in areas of the state where Obama could be expected to do well. Obama swamped Clinton in North Carolina, righting his campaign after a rough patch fueled by his comments on ""bitter"" small-town residents and a controversy over racially charged comments by his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. The two Democrats have battled for months for the right to represent the party in November's presidential election against Republican John McCain. ""We have seen that it's possible to overcome the politics of division and distraction, that it's possible to overcome the same old negative attacks,"" Obama told cheering supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina. Obama, a 46-year-old Illinois senator who would be the first black U.S. president, started his remarks by congratulating Clinton on ""what appears to be a victory in the great state of Indiana."" Obama led 57 percent to 43 percent in North Carolina with about 62 percent of the vote counted. His big win there moved him closer to the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the party's August convention and reduced Clinton's chances to overtake him in either delegates or popular votes won. Indiana and North Carolina, with a combined 187 delegates to the Democrats' convention at stake, were the biggest prizes left in the Democratic race. Only six contests remain with a combined 187 delegates at stake. 'NEAR FINISH LINE' Obama has an almost unassailable lead in pledged delegates who will help select the Democratic nominee. An MSNBC count before Tuesday's contests had Obama with 1,746 delegates to Clinton's 1,611. Delegates had not been awarded from Tuesday's contests, but they are allocated on a proportional, rather than a winner-take-all basis. ""We're nearing the finish line,"" Obama's chief strategist David Axelrod told reporters. ""I think we've taken another big step down the road here to ending this contest and beginning the general election campaign."" But neither candidate can win enough delegates to clinch the race before the state-by-state voting ends on June 3, leaving the decision to nearly 800 superdelegates -- party insiders free to back any candidate. Clinton, a 60-year-old New York senator and former first lady who would be the country's first woman president, dodged another potential knock-out blow from Obama with her projected Indiana win. Her campaign said the race was far from over. ""They've been trying to wrap up this nomination over the will of the voters for a long time, and it hasn't worked,"" said Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee. ""There's a funny thing about democracy. Voters like to have a say."" ECONOMY WORRIES VOTERS The country's faltering economy has increasingly preoccupied voters since the start of the presidential nominating contests in January. Exit polls showed the economy was the top issue for two-thirds of Indiana voters and about 6 of every 10 voters in North Carolina. Clinton narrowly led among those voters in Indiana, while Obama led in North Carolina. In the last week, the two Democrats had courted working- and middle-class voters suffering from an ailing economy and high gas prices and battled over Clinton's proposal to lift the federal gasoline tax for the summer. Exit polls showed about half of Clinton's supporters in Indiana said they would either not vote or support McCain if Obama won the nomination. Obama appeared to be addressing those concerns in his victory celebration in North Carolina, and was already looking toward a campaign against McCain in November. ""This fall, we intend to march forward as one Democratic Party, united by a common vision for this country,"" Obama said. Voter turnout was reported to be high in both states, as it has been throughout the Democratic race -- a reflection of the interest and enthusiasm the duel between Obama and Clinton has generated among Democrats"

Capello, who took charge of England in January following their failure to qualify for next month's Euro 2008 finals, has so far won one match and lost another. But the 61-year-old Italian said he was confident of achieving the goals set out in the 50-page review entitled The FA's Vision 2008-12. ""I think the team I have at the moment is capable of achieving these targets,"" Capello told reporters at Wembley Stadium. ""I believe you must always be positive. My personal objective every time I have coached and managed has been to get to the top. ""It is no surprise that these targets have been set and we should be confident with them."" The document noted that Capello's task was not helped by the number of foreigners now playing in England. ""It is no longer possible to consider the success of the senior men's team without acknowledging that the number of eligible players for it is declining,"" it stated. FOOTBALL CENTRE The FA announced it was pressing ahead with a new National Football Centre in the English midlands and would be appointing an international performance director, responsible for all England teams below the senior men's team. The FA wants 20,500 new teams created at grass roots level by 2012 and an additional 8,000 referees while retaining the 26,000 who already officiate at matches around the country. The review was ordered following England's failure to qualify for Euro 2008 and David Triesman, the FA's new chairman told a news conference: ""The FA is prepared to adopt a winning mentality, not just on the pitch but in everything we do and speak and act for the greatest sport in the world."" Triesman said he was like every other England fan. ""I want us to win, I want us to be in the mix for every major tournament and that we are there with the prospect of winning."" Capello added that the National Football Centre at Burton was crucial to give the England team its own base. According to the report, the centre will act as a ""preparation base for all the international representative teams and a hub from where best practice can be shared"". Among the other 'Major Milestones' unveiled by the FA are successfully to bid to host the 2018 World Cup, for Wembley to be achieving an annual operating profit by 2012 and for the FA's Respect campaign to improve overall disciplinary performance by 25 per cent by 2012"

""We are all subject to making mistakes and I made a mistake in looking for this. I did not at any moment know they were tranvestites,"" the 31-year-old added in his first public appearance since the incident last Monday. ""I cried a lot afterwards. I was incredibly ashamed."" Police said Ronaldo, who is recovering from a knee injury, went to a motel in Rio's upmarket Barra da Tijuca district with three call girls only to find out they weretransvestites. The police have said they are considering charging one of the transvestites with extortion and stealing Ronaldo's driving licence. Ronaldo, who gave the interview at his plush seaside mansion in Angra dos Reis, admitted the incident had done irreparable damage to his reputation. ""This was the worst decision of my personal life,"" he said. ""It took on a very big dimension and had worldwide repercussion. It will stain my personal life forever."" ""For the sensationalist media, this has had a bigger impact than the World Cup,"" said Ronaldo, who scored both goals when Brazil beat Germany 2-0 in the 2002 World Cup final. 'SILLY' FIGHT He said the fateful evening had began after he had a ""silly"" fight with his girlfriend. ""I did not know they were transvestites, I'm completely heterosexual,"" he said. ""When we got to the place, I concluded that they were transvestites. ""I tried to stop there and go homeit was here that the extortion started. ""I wanted to finish by paying what we had agreed. Two accepted but the third didn't want to accept and asked an absurd quantity for it not to come out in the media."" Ronaldo added: ""I preferred to face the situation head on rather than be extorted."" He said his girlfriend had reacted furiously, though she later supported him. ""When I told her the story she swore at me. Afterwards she gave me support,"" the player said. ""Obviously it was very difficult for her to forgive, we don't know what will happen from now on. ""Behind the personality which I carry, I'm a normal person and I have my weaknesses and my fears. ""I have to reconstruct everything. It's like a house which has been knocked down by a hurricane.

en.15.65.461.2008.5.6,US set for first execution since end of moratorium,"Atlanta, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia is set to execute a convicted murderer on Tuesday, the first US inmate to be put to death since the Supreme Court ended a de facto moratorium on capital punishment last month. William Earl Lynd is due to die by lethal injection at a prison in Jackson, central Georgia, at 7 p.m. (2300 GMT) for shooting his girlfriend Ginger Moore three times in the head and face in December 1988, authorities said. Lynd buried his victim in a shallow grave near Tifton, south Georgia. Soon afterward, while driving to Ohio, he shot and killed another woman but he has not been convicted of that crime, according to the state attorney general's office. Campaigners who oppose the death penalty say they plan demonstrations in five cities in Georgia at the time of the execution, as well as outside the prison. Lynd's lawyers have appealed to the state's Supreme Court for a stay of execution, arguing that experts who described the murder scene in court exaggerated what they saw. The court was not expected to rule on the stay before Tuesday afternoon, according to court spokeswoman Jane Hansen. Had the experts described the scene accurately, Lynd would not have been charged with aggravated murder and kidnapping, crimes that warrant the death penalty in Georgia, according to Laura Moye of Amnesty International. ""This is the crazy world of death penalty cases. The timelines go pretty much down to the wire,"" said Moye, adding that a final appeal to the US Supreme Court might also be possible. Lynd has requested a last meal of two pepper jack barbecue burgers with crispy onions, two baked potatoes with sour cream, bacon and cheese, and a large strawberry milkshake, prison authorities said. DEATH KNELL If Lynd's execution goes ahead, it will be the first since the US Supreme Court on April 16 rejected a challenge to the lethal three-drug cocktail used in most US executions, which opponents had claimed inflicted unnecessary pain. A nationwide moratorium had been in effect since just after the court said on September 25 it would hear the appeal by two death row inmates in Kentucky. That decision raised hopes among death penalty opponents that it could be the death knell for capital punishment in America. One convicted murderer was executed in Texas a few hours after the court said it would hear the case but no execution has been carried out since then in the United States. Several states have been quick to schedule executions since the moratorium ended, including Virginia and Texas, which carries out more executions than any other state. Alabama also says it will not delay in resuming executions. The next person executed in America will be the 1,100th put to death since the Supreme Court lifted a temporary ban on the practice in 1976. Since that time, Texas has led the way with 405 executions, followed by Virginia with 98. Last year, 42 people were executed in America, the lowest number since 1994 when 31 were put to death. But the number would almost certainly have been higher last year if it had not been for the Supreme Court case"
en.15.65.4.2008.5.6,Ministry moves to activate DPDC,"Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)- The power ministry has asked the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority to start the process to immediately activate the Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC). ""Initiative has been taken to make the DPDC effective. A committee has been formed for recruitment with former secretary Khawaja Golam Ahmed as its chief. I hope DPDC can be made effective soon,"" Power Division secretary M Fouzul Kabir Khan told bdnews24.com. He said the customer service quality in the capital would improve further with an effective DPDC, formed in 2005 as part of power sector reconstruction to replace DESA. However, the DPDC could not be made effective amid howls of protests from the Power Division, especially the DESA unions. Ministry officials said once the DPDC comes into effect, the DESA area would go under DPDC that would distribute electricity in those areas. An official of the ministry, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com, ""The infrastructure of the power distribution system in the DESA area needs improvement. There are faults in transformers and distribution lines in many areas of DESA. ""As a result, DESA is failing to provide the service expected of it. Transformers have to be changed and new distribution lines set up. If DPDC becomes effective the work on this infrastructure development would start."" Officials at the ministry said DESA had been directed to hand over resources including distribution lines to DPDC. Primarily the DESA employees would not be retrenched. For appointment in the DPDC, those now engaged in the power distribution in metropolitan area would be given priority. It means many from DESA would get jobs with the DPDC and those failing to land DPDC jobs would be given jobs elsewhere and financial benefits as well, the officials added. Appointments to several top posts including managing director, general manager and director have been made. However, the manpower structure of DPDC has not yet been drawn. The ministry would fix the manpower in line with the decision of the DPDC board. The DESA Ordinance was promulgated in 1990 for power distribution in the capital and DESA started work on October 1, 1991. It initially started work of power distribution in greater Dhaka but after the launch of DESCO and the handover of some areas to the Rural Electrification Board (REB), it now distributes power to the southern part of Dhaka, Tejgaon, Shyamoli, Dhanmondi and Narayganj town. DESA has six lakh subscribers and a over 3000-strong workforce bdnews24"

en.15.65.206.2008.4.30,Tribunal rejects Shoaib appeal on five year ban,"KARACHI (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A tribunal rejected fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar's appeal on Wednesday against the five-year ban imposed on him by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Justice Aftab Farrukh, head of the three-member tribunal, told reporters the suspension would remain in place. ""Shoaib could play anywhere else in the world but not in or for Pakistan domestically or internationally,"" said Farrukh. The 32-year-old Shoaib was banned earlier this month for repeated disciplinary violations, the most recent being his criticism of board policies when the new central contracts were announced in January. The paceman made an unconditional apology to the tribunal on Monday and pledged to mend his ways. Farrukh, though, was critical of Shoaib's past conduct. ""We feel he has not tried to reform himself in the past and repeatedly violated discipline,"" said Farrukh. ""He has caused problems for the board and to his team mates and not lived up to the expectations of the nation."" Tafazzul Rizvi, the PCB's legal counsel at the hearing, said the tribunal had offered some respite for Shoaib. ""They have provided him relief by allowing him to play anywhere else outside Pakistan,"" Rizvi told Reuters. He added the PCB did not want to prevent Shoaib earning his living elsewhere, opening up the possibility of the fast bowler joining the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL). ""If someone asks us we will make it clear we have no objections,"" added Rizvi. ""How he (Shoaib) behaves in future is up to him. He has apologised to the tribunal, not to the board."
en.15.65.328.2008.5.4,Jute workers call for efforts to revive sagging industry,"Dhaka, May 04 (bdnews24.com)Labour leaders of the jute industry Sunday pressed the government for immediate measures to revive what they said was the golden industry of Bangladesh. At a press conference, organised by a committee of jute mill workers in Khulna, they said the past governments had not made efforts to revive the once-profitable industry. ""The present caretaker government's last budget did not address the issue either. We hope that this government will neither close nor lease out the jute mills but will allocate necessary resources in the next budget to save the industry,"" Khalid Hossain, a member of the committee, told reporters. They said that 32,000 workers and their families of eight state-owned jute mills in Khulna would fall in deep trouble if the mills were shut down. They demanded faster payment of outstanding salaries, a revised salary structure for shift workers and a coordinated effort by economists, workers, farmers and the government to salvage the industry. Recently, the six sate-owned jute mills of Khulna zone have appointed workers on a daily basis in violation of labour laws, which hurts productivity, according to a written statement released by the committee. The state-owned jute mills are divided into three zones, namely Dhaka, Chittagong and Khulna. ""There are no daily workers in the other two zones. So, workers of this zone are demoralised,"" Liakat Ali, an adviser of the committee, told bdnews24.com. The committee asked the media to raise the issue for increased awareness of sufferings of the industry as well as the workers and asked the government to address the issue in the upcoming budget. bdn"
en.15.65.484.2008.5.3,US weighs thousands more troops for Afghan war: paper,"New York, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pentagon is considering sending up to 7,000 more US troops to Afghanistan next year to make up for a shortfall in contributions from NATO allies, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The increase would likely result in ""the re-Americanization"" of the war, one U.S. official said, according to the Times. U.S. forces would then account for two-thirds of foreign troops in Afghanistan, it said. The report appeared a day after Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the United States could consider taking over NATO's command in southern Afghanistan, where some NATO allies have been reluctant to provide combat forces. Southern Afghanistan, site of the worst in a surge of Taliban violence, is now under NATO command. Britain, Canada, the Netherlands and Australia all have forces in the region. ""This is a matter that's going to be looked at over probably some period of time primarily because it requires consultation with our allies,"" Gates told reporters when asked to comment on discussion at the Pentagon about the possibility of taking over command in southern Afghanistan. ""It certainly is worth taking a look at,"" he added during a visit to the Red River Army Depot in Texarkana, Texas. REDUCTION IN IRAQ Citing unnamed Bush administration officials, the Times said sending up to 7,000 additional troops would increase U.S. forces in Afghanistan to some 40,000, the highest level since the United States invaded the country in 2001 and toppled the Taliban government after the September 11 attacks. The increase would require a reduction in troop levels in Iraq by at least a modest amount, and planning for it began in recent weeks, the newspaper said. ""There are simply going to be more American forces than we've ever had there,"" the Times quoted a senior official as saying. The officials said the decision for more troops could be left to the next U.S. president, who will take office in January, and that few additional troops were expected in Afghanistan any time soon. The United States has 34,000 troops in Afghanistan under two commands. About 16,000 soldiers under U.S. European Command serve as part of a 47,000-strong NATO force. A further 18,000 U.S. troops are in the country separately under U.S. Central Command. ""We need to look also at some of our own command and control arrangements. For example, does it continue to make sense to have two combatant commands involved in one country?"" the defense chief said. ""We're basically just trying to see how do you best provide for unity of command, how do you have the most effective operations possible in Afghanistan,"" he added. The United States has begun to increase its troop presence in the south. Canada threatened briefly to withdraw its 2,500 soldiers from southern Afghanistan unless more NATO troops were sent to the region. But it relented last month when France offered several hundred additional soldiers."
en.15.65.231.2008.5.4,Health care waits to ignite as campaign issue,"DENVER, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The sharply contrasting health care visions of Republican John McCain and his Democratic presidential rivals offer the promise of a grand campaign debate -- if the candidates find room on a crowded agenda. While health care reform ranks as the second-biggest domestic issue after the economy in most national opinion polls, it will compete with the Iraq war, taxes, high gas prices and other topics for a prime-time spot in the campaign for November's presidential election. Nearly two decades of health care debate has made little headway toward finding a consensus approach, and the issue has not been a key factor in a presidential election since the collapse of the Hillary Clinton-led reform effort in 1994. ""There is no question there are fundamental, Grand Canyon-like differences on health care between the two parties,"" said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy group. ""But it's an open question whether it will be a hot issue in the campaign,"" he said. ""I now believe the biggest obstacle to health care reform is this ideological divide -- is there any way to bridge these differences?"" McCain, who has clinched the Republican presidential nomination, and Democratic Sens. Barack Obama of Illinois and Clinton of New York have unveiled ambitious but very different plans to overhaul the health care system. McCain finished a week-long campaign swing in Denver on Friday that highlighted his plan, which would use tax credits to help shift from employer-based insurance coverage to an open market system where people can choose from competing policies. Clinton and Obama seek universal health coverage for the 47 million Americans without insurance. Clinton would mandate coverage, while Obama would require it only for children. The Democratic plans would keep the existing job-based insurance system but expand government involvement in a hybrid public-private system. TOUGH SELL McCain calls the Democratic plan a ""big government"" solution that limits choice. Democrats say his plan reduces the incentive for companies to offer coverage and puts workers at risk of not getting it -- particularly those with pre-existing conditions that insurance companies will not cover. Paul Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan policy research organization, said the Democratic plans had more political appeal. ""I would expect to see the Democratic approach resonate more with voters. They are very clearly telling voters you are going to be eligible for a public program,"" he said. McCain's plan to allow people to move away from job-based coverage is a tough sell, analysts said. Polls show three-quarters or more of Americans are generally happy with the insurance they get through their employers. At least some of the political fury that doomed Clinton's health care initiative in 1994, when she was first lady, was fueled by the reluctance of people to abandon their employer health coverage. A 2007 survey by the Commonwealth Fund, a private nonpartisan foundation that supports health policy research, found four of every five Americans, including three-quarters of Republicans, believed employers should either provide health insurance for workers or contribute to the cost. ""People are comfortable with what they know and afraid of change,"" Altman said. ""The burden of proof is always on people who want to change their current health plan."" McCain's plan is similar to the one put forth by President George W. Bush that fell flat in Congress, where gridlock on the issue is the norm. All of the proposals would face potentially drastic changes in Congress. 'BASIC INSECURITIES' ""I don't think McCain's plan goes to the heart of people's concerns. It does not address the basic insecurities of not having coverage or not having enough money to pay your bills,"" said Susan Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund. ""It may sound good. 'You're in charge.' But because of the way the insurance market works, it's difficult,"" Davis said. ""The whole market is geared to excluding people who are sick."" McCain said Americans would warm to his proposals once they became familiar with them. ""I'm confident that when we debate and discuss this issue most Americans would rather have their families making decisions about their health care,"" McCain told reporters last week. ""The issue cannot go unaddressed."" But Ginsburg did not sound confident health care would become a top agenda item in the next six months. ""I wonder if it's going to be so complicated that people tune out,"" he said. ""We probably won't come out of this election with a real mandate for getting it done."""

en.15.65.54.2008.5.3,"Climate change warms Arctic, cools Antarctica","Washington, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Arctic and Antarctica are poles apart when it comes to the effects of human-fueled climate change, scientists said on Friday: in the north, it is melting sea ice, but in the south, it powers winds that chill things down. The North and South poles are both subject to solar radiation and rising levels of climate-warming greenhouse gases, the researchers said in a telephone briefing. But Antarctica is also affected by an ozone hole hovering high above it during the austral summer. ""All the evidence points toward human-made effects playing a major role in the changes that we see at both poles and evidence that contradicts this is very hard to find,"" said Jennifer Francis, an atmospheric scientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey. An examination of many previous studies about polar climate, to be published May 6 in the journal Eos, ""further depletes the arsenal of those who insist that human-caused climate change is nothing to worry about,"" Francis said in a telephone briefing. In the Arctic, Francis and co-authors of the research said, warming spurred by human-generated carbon dioxide emissions has combined with natural climate variations to create a ""perfect Arctic storm"" that caused a dramatic disappearance of sea ice last year, a trend likely to continue. 'NEW STATE' ""Natural climate variability and global warming were actually working together and they've sent the Arctic into a new state for the climate that has much less sea ice,"" said James Overland, an oceanographer at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""There's very little chance for the climate to return to the conditions of 20 years ago."" In Antarctica, the ozone hole adds a new factor to an already complicated set of weather patterns, according to Gareth Marshall of the British Antarctic Survey. The changes in air pressure that go along with depleted stratospheric ozone are responsible for an increase in the westerly winds that whip around the Southern Ocean, at latitudes a bit north of most of Antarctica. These winds isolate much of the southern continent from some of the impact of global warming, Marshall said. The exception is the Antarctic Peninsula, which reaches northward toward South America. There, the effects of warming have been dramatic, he said, because the winds that protect the rest of Antarctica do not insulate the peninsula. The stratospheric ozone hole, caused by the ozone-depleting release of chemicals found in refrigerants and hair sprays, is likely to fully recover by 2070 as less of these chemicals are in use, as a result of international agreements. The ozone layer shields Earth from harmful solar radiation, but its recovery is likely to open the way for warming in central Antarctica, the scientists said."
en.15.65.40.2008.5.3,Older Japanese go online in search of love,"Tokyo, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - You're never too old to fall in love. That's what Yoji Kawamura figured after retiring at the age of 62 and deciding that part-time work and his new hobbies of photography and computers weren't enough to fill his days. Like a small but growing number of older Japanese singles, Kawamura has turned to an online matchmaking service in search of someone to share his ""second life"". ""When you reach my age, the scope of your activities shrinks and you can only meet people within a narrow circle,"" said Kawamura, sipping coffee in a cafe in Tokyo. ""If you want to go outside that circle, you don't know how."" A former taxi driver who divorced 26 years ago and is now 65, Kawamura signed up with U.S.-based online dating service Match.com, part of Internet conglomerate IAC/InterActiveCorp. last July. ""My horizons have widened and my life is richer because I can make friends,"" said the goateed Kawamura, who is now dating three women, two of whom are nine years his junior and one who is 62. Launched in Japan in 2004 and now boasting about 840,000 members, Match.com began targeting the mature market after seeing the fastest growth in membership among the over-50 set, an age group once thought over the hill when it came to romance. Although nearly half of Match.com members in Japan are aged 30-39, another 9 percent are aged 50 and over. ""It used to be considered that people aged 50 and over didn't talk about love. People would say, 'No way, you're too old',"" said Match.com Japan President Katsuki Kuwano. ""These days, it's become acceptable for people in that age group to talk about marriage and love."" CULTURAL CHANGE The growth of Japan's graying population is partly behind such changing views. Already one in five Japanese are aged 65 or older and the percentage is expected to double by mid-century. Older Japanese have become more at ease with the Internet, while the numbers of people who have never married or who divorce, often after decades of marriage, is on the rise. ""With an increase in the divorce rate and more and more people accepting second marriages, that has definitely changed,"" said James Farrer, a sociology professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. ""I think there is a cultural change in the way these things are talked about in the media,"" he added. ""There is a sense that older people are sexual, and it's legitimate to talk about it."" Adult children who once expected to live with their parents and discouraged them from remarrying are also more supportive. ""People are living longer and more families are nuclear. There are more people like me who are living alone,"" Kawamura said. ""Adult children are now keen for their parents to find someone to be with. Then they don't have to feel anxious."" Other online entrepreneurs eyeing the same market agree changing values are making it easier for older Japanese to own up to a yearning for romance -- and do something about it. ""People in their 20s and 30s think it's important to find their own happiness, so they can understand their parents wanting to do the same,"" said Junichi Ikeda, president of online marriage consultancy ""Ai Senior"", or ""Senior Love"". He boasts his oldest member is a 90-year-old man. LINGERING IMAGE PROBLEMS Still, an image of online dating services as shady fronts for sleazy one-night stands and prostitution lingers. ""I haven't told my children because I think it's best to meet someone naturally,"" said Match.com member Naomi, a 52-year-old divorcee who signed up in February. ""That may be an old-fashioned way of thinking, but the image of dating sites isn't very good."" Such concerns are one reason why women make up only 40 percent of Match.com members in Japan compared with 50 percent in the United States, Kuwano said. Another is pride. ""They are afraid that using the Internet to find someone makes them look like losers,"" he said. Online or off, the search for love can still be fraught with obstacles, including the potential for mismatched priorities. A Match.com survey showed that Japanese men and women both put ""shared values"" as their top priority in a partner but men list ""similar personality"" second, while women cite income. Kawamura says he experienced just that problem when he first joined Match.com, one reason he dropped out for a while. ""I'd send and receive email and they'd ask about my job. But my occupation is at the bottom of the scale in Japan,"" he said. Lately, though, things are looking up and Kawamura has moved near one of his women friends so they can get to know each other better. But he's not in a rush. ""The most basic thing is to be honest. And to be patient."""
en.15.65.432.2008.5.4,"Japan, China keen to avoid 1998 Jiang visit rerun","TOKYO, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ten years after a disastrous visit to Japan by China's top leader dominated by their bitter wartime past, Beijing and Tokyo are keen to avoid a rerun that would risk damage to the deep economic ties between the Asian rivals. Chinese President Hu Jintao will retrace some of predecessor Jiang Zemin's steps while in Japan, dining at the Imperial Palace and speaking to students at Tokyo's Waseda University a day after his Wednesday summit with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda. But few expect the sort of pointed lectures on Japan's 1931-1945 invasion and occupation of China that Jiang delivered at a state banquet hosted by Emperor Akihito, in his own speech at Waseda and during his only news conference in Tokyo. The two countries ""have gone through a very difficult 10 years and have realized that abusing history for short-term diplomatic and political gains has its costs,"" said Andrew Horvat, a professor at Tokyo Keizai University. ""I think they have learned that."" Arriving in Japan not long after Tokyo had apologized to South Korea for its often-brutal 1910-1945 colonization of the peninsula, Jiang had sought a written apology for China. When it became clear none was in store, whether because Jiang refused to promise to let bygones be bygones or because hardline Japanese politicians dug in their heels, or both, the Chinese leader delivered a series of harsh rebukes over Japan's past. By one account, Japanese present ""visibly paled"" when Jiang lectured on the wartime past in front of the emperor, a scene one Japanese official recalled left him with a ""sense of bitterness"". Many Chinese, for their part, were angry and offended by Tokyo's refusal to offer more than a verbal apology. INTERTWINED ECONOMIES Despite efforts by both sides to repair the damage, relations chilled again between 2001-2006, when Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made yearly visits to Yasukuni Shrine for war dead, seen in Beijing as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. In a sign that episode still rankles, Japanese media reported that Koizumi would not attend either a state dinner for Hu or his breakfast meeting with former Japanese prime ministers. Some 18 months after Koizumi's successor, Shinzo Abe, initiated a thaw with an ""ice-breaking"" visit to Beijing, both sides now have many reasons to try to ensure Hu's visit goes smoothly. ""If you see the current situation of relations between the two countries, I don't think that the history issue is one we have to tackle now,"" a Japanese foreign ministry official said. China overtook the United States as Japan's biggest export market in 2007 and Japanese foreign direct investment to China stood at $6.2 billion last year after hitting a peak of $6.6 billion in 2005. Under fire internationally over its human rights record in Tibet and elsewhere ahead of the August Olympics, Beijing is keen for Fukuda's support for the Games. Fukuda, dogged by doubts about his ability to cope with a divided parliament and a combative opposition, needs a diplomatic success to try to halt a slide in his support rates, which the Mainichi newspaper said on Saturday had slumped to 18 percent. FLASHPOINTS Still, potential flash points remain for Hu's visit, his first abroad since anti-Chinese unrest erupted in Tibet in March. Japanese nationalists have seized on the issue of human rights in Tibet to criticize China and rightwing activists could well take part in protests by pro-Tibet groups during Hu's visit. ""China is very keen to keep Tibet off the agenda and Japan is under pressure (to bring it up),"" said Phil Deans, a professor of international affairs at Temple University's Japan campus. ""It's a question of how anodyne they can make their statements."" Patriotic sentiment in China has been inflamed by Tibetan unrest and Western criticism, while Japanese anxiety about rival China's rise has been stirred by a row over pesticide-tainted dumplings and Chinese fervor during the Olympic torch relay, one reason Hu will try to show a friendlier face during his stay. Failure to resolve a feud over energy resources in the East China Sea could incline Japanese media to dismiss the summit as a performance lacking substance, one Japanese diplomatic expert said, but prospects of a breakthrough appear dim. ""Is the visit going to be hunky-dory?"" said Horvat. ""You can't put money on it, but you can assume they have learned from past mistakes."""
en.15.65.150.2008.5.4,Buffett says Fed avoided chaos in Bear bailout,"OMAHA, Nebraska, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Warren Buffett said on Saturday said the U.S. Federal Reserve avoided financial market ""chaos"" in coordinating the March bailout of Bear Stearns Cos (BSC.N: Quote, Profile, Research), which faced imminent bankruptcy before agreeing to be acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N: Quote, Profile, Research). The central bank, led by Chairman Ben Bernanke, helped broker the buyout, after liquidity evaporated at Bear, which had been Wall Street's fifth-largest investment bank. JPMorgan, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, agreed to pay $10 per share for Bear, and the Fed agreed to guarantee $29 billion of Bear's assets. ""I think the Fed did the right thing in stepping in on Bear Stearns,"" Buffett said at the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N: Quote, Profile, Research) (BRKb.N: Quote, Profile, Research) insurance and investment company. ""Just imagine the thousands of counterparties around the world having to undo contracts."" Buffett said a record 31,000 shareholders attended the meeting in Omaha's Qwest Center, including an overflow crowd in halls outside the main arena. He and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger fielded questions for five hours, often humorously, on investing, the economy, politics and life. Attendance has soared since Berkshire in 1996 created Class B shares worth 1/30th of a Class A share. These made it easier for ordinary investors to invest with Buffett, the world's richest person. RISK AT ISSUE Buffett said the Bear debacle illustrates how some investment banks and commercial banks may have grown too large to effectively manage risk. ""The big investment banks, a number of them, and big commercial banks, I think they're almost too big to manage effectively from a risk standpoint in the way they've elected to conduct their business,"" he said. ""You need someone at the top whose DNA is very, very much programmed against risk."" Berkshire is, he said. ""We want to run Berkshire where if the world isn't working tomorrow the way it is working today, or in a way that wasn't expected, we wouldn't have a problem,"" Buffett said. ""If we can earn a decent return on capital, what's an extra percentage point?"" One area of concern is the estimated $60 trillion market for credit default swaps, an insurance contract that covers losses to banks and bondholders when companies don't pay their debts, and lets investors bet on credit markets. Yet Buffett doesn't foresee a collapse. ""I don't think it's going to happen, and I think the chances of it happening were reduced significantly by the fact the Fed stepped in at Bear Stearns,"" he said. Berkshire, however, has benefited from market disruptions, including many triggered by the nation's housing crisis. Buffett said his four-month-old bond insurer, Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp, wrote $400 million in business in the first quarter, more perhaps than other rivals combined. Much, he said, came from customers who already had insurance from other ""triple-A"" rated insurers, some of which got caught with exposure to subprime mortgages. ""It tells you something about the meaning of 'triple-A' in the bond insurance field in the first quarter,"" Buffett said. Buffett said Berkshire also bought $4 billion in ""auction-rate"" municipal debt whose yields soared, often into double digits, despite many issuers' high credit quality. SUCCESSION ON TRACK; BUFFETT EYES EUROPE Buffett, 77, said Berkshire still has three internal candidates to eventually succeed him as chief executive, and four candidates to become chief investment officer. Berkshire ended March with about $147 billion in stocks, bonds and cash. But noting that the average age between he and Munger is 80, and assuming they'll live to be 100, Buffett joked: ""We're only aging at 1-1/4 percent a year.

Buffett plans this month to visit four European countries to seek out family-owned businesses he might want to buy when the time comes for a sale. He said Berkshire isn't on the ""radar screen"" of many potential sellers in Europe.

Buffett occasionally addressed more controversial issues. Asked whether he should push Coca-Cola Co (KO.N: Quote, Profile, Research) to pull back from its role as a big corporate supporter of the Summer Olympics in Beijing, Buffett said it would be a ""terrible mistake"" not to back the Olympic movement. Berkshire ended 2007 with an 8.6 percent stake in Coca-Cola. And Buffett turned back efforts by American Indian tribes and salmon fishermen to have Berkshire's PacifiCorp unit remove four dams on the Klamath River in California and Oregon, which they say kill fish. Three people asked Buffett questions about it and protesters occasionally shouted opposition to the dams."
en.15.65.390.2008.5.1,China to be focus of US attention in Asia: CIA,"Washington, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China is likely to achieve great-power status this century and maintain a military buildup but is not an inevitable enemy, CIA Director Michael Hayden said on Wednesday. China is an economic and strategic competitor with the United States, Hayden said in a Kansas speech on 21st-century trends, adding the country was likely to continue a ""troubling"" military buildup. ""China, a communist-led, nuclear state that aspires to -- and will likely achieve -- great power status during this century, will be the focus of U.S. attention (in Asia),"" he said. It all depends on whether China acts from a narrow self-interest or with broader perspective, Hayden said in a speech at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas. ""If Beijing begins to accept greater responsibility for the health of the international system -- as all global powers should -- we will remain on a constructive, even if competitive, path. If not, the rise of China begins to look more adversarial,"" Hayden said in his prepared remarks. Beijing is determined to show its strength ""after two centuries of perceived Western hegemony,"" he said. He said the military buildup was influenced by the US show of armed might in the two Gulf wars and reinforced concerns about China's intentions toward Taiwan. ""But even without that issue, we assess that a buildup would continue."" China needs to access markets, technology and resources, and wants to assert its influence, but faces challenges including uneven income distribution, a growing dependence on imports of oil and other resources and environmental degradation. Hayden also outlined two other dominant global trends for the century -- a population boom in poor countries and resultant migration to the developed world, and a changing US relationship with Europe marked by differences over how to fight terrorism. ""When there is a direct threat to their people or interests, European governments work with each other and their allies, including the United States, to disrupt it. But they tend not to view terrorism as we do -- as an overwhelming international challenge. Or if they do, we often differ on what would be effective and appropriate to counter it."

""During the celebrations Raul and (Gabriel) Heinze took me to one side and said something very sensible: 'don't destroy this team, don't destroy it' they said,"" Calderon told sports daily AS on Tuesday. ""What they meant was that we shouldn't make too many changes. We shouldn't sell players without thinking it through carefully beforehand and we shouldn't sign players just for the sake of signing them. ""We are going through a very successful period and they don't want it destroyed by bad decision making and I agree with them."" Real spent around 120 million euros on eight new editions to their championship-winning squad at the end of last season. This time round they are expected to exercise their option to bring former youth team players Ruben de la Red, Esteban Granero and Javi Garcia back to the club and have also been linked with Valencia striker David Villa. But Calderon effectively ruled out bids for big-name Premier League players Cristiano Ronaldo and Cesc Fabregas. ""Right now signing Cristiano Ronaldo is a utopia. His type of player only come to Madrid if they want to. We can't force a player to sign. If he says he is leaving then we can sit down an negotiate The same is true of Cesc."" Real wrapped up their second league title in a row with a dramatic 2-1 win at Osasuna on Sunday and are hoping to celebrate in front of their own fans with a victory over arch-rivals Barcelona at the Bernabeu on Wednesday"

India, the only team yet to lose in the four-nation meet, raced to 161 for five in 41 overs after bundling Bangladesh out for 160 in 50 overs. Bangladesh's batswomen put up an improved display against India compared with their first match against the same opponents. India handed a massive 182-run defeat to Bangladesh after bundling out them for 68.

en.15.65.481.2008.5.6,"Turning 60, Israelis feel pride, Palestinians pain","REHOVOT, Israel/GAZA (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Like the state of Israel, Akram al-Shamali and Moshe Feist both turn 60 this year. But that's about where the similarities end. For Feist, an Israeli, the anniversary is a chance to celebrate the Jewish state's hard-fought achievements and swap stories of survival and patriotism over a glass of local wine. For Shamali, it is time to mourn the Nakba, or ""catastrophe"", when 700,000 Palestinians, his own family among them, fled in fear of Jewish attacks as violence mounted. He lives in the Gaza Strip, where Islamist rule makes alcohol taboo and an Israeli blockade cuts into any festivities. Their opposing views on the conflict into which they were born reflect lives lived in close proximity -- they grew up about 60 km (37 miles) from each other -- but worlds apart. Shamali slept in his mother's arms in April 1948 as she fled the family home in Jaffa, a biblical city now a part of the Israeli city of Tel Aviv but for centuries a bustling Arab port. He has never since set foot in his parents' house, but dreams of one day reclaiming it. ""I don't know how or when, but one day I will go back to our house in Jaffa,"" Shamali told Reuters in an interview at his dimly lit Gaza City office. ""I feel it in my heart."" The son of a German farm worker who fled Nazi Germany for a kibbutz in British-ruled Palestine, Feist was born a few months later than Shamali into the infant state of Israel, created as a haven for Jews after six million died in the Holocaust in Europe. For Feist, Jaffa and other towns are now an inseparable part of his homeland and his view is that Palestinians gave up their rights there decades ago. ""You can't come back and say 'my mother used to live here 50 years ago and it is mine now'. So what?"" Feist told Reuters at his airy apartment in Rehovot, near Tel Aviv. ""The Arabs didn't want to live with the Jews so they left. No one pushed them."" REFUGEES That's not how Shamali sees it. When his parents and their four sons left Jaffa, they expected to return in months. He said they had hoped violence between Jews and Arabs would abate. It never happened. As violence on both sides killed thousands in the months after a UN decision in 1947 to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, the Shamali family and their neighbors crammed into a truck bound further down the Mediterranean coast to Gaza, outside the zone designated to Jewish control. They slept on the beach while they hunted for lodgings. After attending a United Nations school for refugees, Shamali built a business fixing cars and says he studiously avoided the politics and violence that shaped so many others. But he resents Israelis for ""stealing"" his land and bristles at Feist's suggestion he gave up the right to his Jaffa home. ""How can the Israelis push us out of our land and homes and bring millions of people from Russia instead?"" he said, referring to Jewish immigration. ""No one just leaves their house for no reason."" Shamali's garage is struggling because of an Israeli economic and military cordon meant to isolate Hamas, which seized the enclave in June. His workshop was empty this week due to fuel shortages that have forced most cars off the road. The spirited businessman once shuttled back and forth to Tel Aviv to collect spare parts, but has not left Gaza -- which is encircled by Israeli fences -- since Israel tightened restrictions last June. ""The worst thing is the lack of freedom,"" he said. TANKS Feist also fixes vehicles -- tanks. He began his compulsory military service just before the 1967 Middle East war in which Israel captured and occupied the Gaza Strip and West Bank, and has fought in four conflicts. His three sons have all seen battle. Feist now runs his own electrical business in Rehovot. He rarely comes into contact with Palestinians and has visited Gaza only four times in his life -- three of those as a soldier, long before Israel pulled out its troops from the enclave in 2005. Like many Israelis, Feist views the conflict with the Palestinians as important but remote -- a serious problem but one that rarely disrupts his daily life, especially now suicide bombings have tailed off from a peak six years ago. ""Do you know how many people get hurt in traffic?"" he joked, as he relaxed in shorts and a T-shirt in a living room bedecked with roses. ""Terrorism is a big problem but Israeli drivers are a much bigger problem."" Feist says he does not fret about much-discussed threats to the continued existence of the Jewish state and laughs if asked whether Israel will survive the next 60 years. ""For us as Jews, the best place to live is Israel -- just like for the English, the best place to live is in England,"" he said. ""Why should Israel not exist in 60 years? You don't talk about other countries just ceasing to exist?"" Despite the pride expressed by Feist and others, this week's festivities mask widespread disenchantment with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's government, which many Israelis view as corrupt and say has failed to protect its citizens. Meanwhile Shamali's patriotism overlooks bitter rivalry between Hamas and President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah faction, as well as mounting frustration at slow progress in efforts to secure Palestinian statehood. After lives punctuated by battle, both men believe it is time to talk. But they hold little faith in a US-sponsored peace drive launched by Abbas and Olmert last year. Both are ready for compromise and would accept a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip alongside Israel. For Shamali, that means relinquishing his dream of return to Jaffa. But perhaps, he says, it is worth it for the sake of his young grandson who wanders into his office as he reminisces. ""Israel is 60 years old and during that time neither they nor us have had the chance to sleep,"" he said, ruffling the toddler's hair. ""It's been 60 years of violence and 60 years of pain."

But inflation pressure mounts. At a press conference at the BB headquarters, chief economist of the central bank's policy analysis unit Mustafa K Mujeri has said the prices of commodities are alarming despite a positive trend in the economy. ""Disbursement of agricultural and industrial credit, import of industrial raw materials and intermediate goods, index of manufacturing production, an increase in exports, and inflow of workers' remittances indicate that the economy is bouncing back to its trend growth path,"" the central bank said in the quarterly report. BB hoped overall GDP would probably grow at a rate between 6.0 percent and 6.2 percent in fiscal 08. The report urged the government to act quickly to ease the electricity, gas and other infrastructure constraints, letting production go unhindered. In the first nine months of FY08, according to the report, estimated total revenue and spending stood at 7.6 percent and 10.9 percent of GDP against their yearly targets of 10.8 percent and 16.4 percent. ""Overall fiscal deficit, as share of GDP, reached 3.2 percent in the first nine months of the fiscal year, as against the yearly target of 4.8 percent."" ""For financing the fiscal deficit, Tk 106.2 billion came from domestic sources which included Tk 30.2 billion from bank sources. Foreign financing stood at Tk 64.3 billion in the first nine months of FY08,"" the report said. It said: ""The point to point inflation eased during February-March 2008. The inflation rate stood at 10.06 percent in March 2008."" But Mustafa Mujeri said the rate was alarming. ""The fight against inflation, however, has to continue with increasing zeal since persistent pressure, as measured by 12 months moving average, is till evident,"" he said. Bangladesh Bank continued to follow its pro-growth monetary policy stance aiming at both ensuring price stability and providing support to highest sustainable growth, Mustafa said. bdnews"
en.15.65.342.2008.5.5,Investors eye Yahoo`s alternatives to Microsoft,"New York/San Francisco, May 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Yahoo Inc faced growing pressure on Sunday to find an alternative strategy to Microsoft Corp's $47.5 billion takeover offer after the software maker walked away over a disagreement on price. Yahoo shares could fall by more than 30 percent on Monday over the breakdown of talks, but that drop could be softened if Wall Street believes Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang has another strategy up his sleeve, analysts said. Yahoo is likely to push for an advertising partnership with Web search leader Google Inc, sources familiar with the matter said. A tie-up with Google, seen as a big winner from the end of Microsoft-Yahoo talks, should help boost Yahoo's operating performance in the near term. ""It's time to get a move on with Google,"" said Jeffrey Lindsay, analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. ""Let's hope they weren't bluffing."" Yahoo is also still considering a deal with another Internet media and advertising major, such as Time Warner Inc's AOL, people familiar with the discussions said. But Yang and the company he helped create could face a flood of shareholder lawsuits or other actions if nothing materializes. ""There are two things that could support the stock: the potential for Microsoft to return and the potential to do a Google deal,"" said Clayton Moran, analyst at Stanford Group. Moran said Yahoo shares could fall to the mid- to low-$20 range on Monday from their $28.67 close last week. Other analysts said it could slip closer to $19.18, where it closed on January 31, a day before Microsoft made its offer public. Microsoft shares are likely to rise on Monday, with its investors relieved that Chief Executive Steve Ballmer didn't shell out billions more for Yahoo, analysts said. Microsoft on Saturday sweetened its initial $31-per-share offer for Yahoo to $33, but then withdrew from the talks when Yang dug in for a price of $37. SHAREHOLDER CHALLENGE While some Yahoo investors hoped it could wrest a price closer to $35 per share from Microsoft, a dissident shareholder said he would challenge Yang and the board over the collapse of talks. ""Shareholders didn't even get a chance to vote on the deal, but the board negotiated on our behalf and not in good faith,"" Eric Jackson, who leads a group of investors who collectively own 2 million Yahoo shares, told Reuters. He said he would urge shareholders to withhold votes from the company's directors this year. Yahoo officials were not immediately available to comment. Bernstein's Lindsay estimates Yahoo could be worth up to $35 per share with a Google deal, and even $37 with more job cuts, but that drops to $25 per share if no partnerships are in the offing. Yahoo has conducted tests with Google to outsource some of its search listings to its arch-rival. It has also held talks in tandem with AOL and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. A source familiar with the matter said on Sunday that the News Corp talks had cooled in recent weeks. ""It increasingly appears like Yahoo will pursue a Google search partnership,"" said Moran, who said he still favored a Microsoft buyout. ""Given Google's position (in the market), a partnership with them cedes control and limits the long-term value creation for Yahoo."" BALLMER'S WARNING Ballmer portrayed Yahoo's options as particularly stark in a letter to Yang detailing his reasons for pulling back, and suggested any Google tie-up would preclude a Microsoft deal. Microsoft and Google are increasingly competing on the same turf, such as Web-based applications, email and messaging. The proposed Yahoo purchase was meant to create a fiercer rival to Google and challenge its hold on Internet advertising. ""The real winner in all of this seems to be Google,"" said Canaccord Adams analyst Colin Gillis. ""There's going to be no powerful number two"" in the Web market, he said. Gillis rated Yahoo a ""buy"" with a $35 price target before the deal talks with Microsoft collapsed. ""We were very clear that was not based on fundamentals,"" he said. Ballmer also warned Yahoo that it would give up its relationship with advertisers by coordinating with Google and could lose some of its best engineering talent. Some analysts disputed that idea, saying Yahoo's operating results would certainly benefit from a Google partnership. Other Google partners, including IAC/InterActiveCorp's Ask.com, have structured deals that keep them in control of their advertiser ties, Bernstein's Lindsay said."
en.15.65.332.2008.5.3,New immune treatment controls AIDS virus: study,"Wasington, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A new type of treatment that trains immune system cells to better recognize the AIDS virus may help control the deadly and incurable infection, Australian researchers reported on Friday. Tests on monkeys infected with a similar virus shows the treatment controlled the infection, although it does not cure it, and tests are already planned in people. The treatment is called OPAL, for Overlapping Peptide-pulsed Autologous Cells, and would be categorized as an immunotherapy technique, or a so-called therapeutic vaccine, Stephen Kent of the University of Melbourne and colleagues said. Writing in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Pathogens, they said the treatment involves mixing a patient's own blood cells with tiny bits of protein from the virus. These cells are then re-infused into the patient. ""Levels of virus in vaccinated monkeys were 10-fold lower than in controls, and this was durable for over one year after the initial vaccinations,"" they wrote. ""The immunotherapy resulted in fewer deaths from AIDS. We conclude this is a promising immunotherapy technique. Trials in HIV-infected humans of OPAL therapy are planned."" The AIDS virus infects more than 33 million people globally and has killed 25 million since it was identified in the 1980s. While there is no cure and no vaccine, cocktails of drugs can control the virus. But they have side-effects, are expensive and eventually often stop working. Kent's team took small bits of the virus called peptides and placed them in lab dishes with both whole blood and isolated immune system cells. This helped train the cells to recognize the virus and attack it more effectively, they wrote in the paper, freely available here The macaque monkeys were infected with a related virus called SIV or simian immunodeficiency virus. HIV is tricky to treat because it attacks the immune system. It specifically goes after immune cells called CD4 T cells, the very cells that are supposed to attack and kill viruses. ""Virus-specific CD4 T cells are typically very weak in HIV-infected humans or SIV-infected macaques; dramatic enhancement of these cells were induced by OPAL immunotherapy and this may underlie its efficacy,"" they wrote. The treatment appears to work best if started right after someone becomes infected. ""Although it may be challenging to identify humans within three weeks of infection, this is when HIV-1 subjects typically present (show up at a doctors office) with acute infection,"" they wrote."

Earlier the adviser told reporters in his office that the representatives of civil society would include business leaders, teachers, local government's representatives, women rights leaders and journalists. The meting was also attended by law adviser AF Hassan Ariff and LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal. The four advisers also held a meeting Monday to discuss preparations for formal dialogue. bdnew"
en.15.65.321.2008.5.4,Abbas sends forces to north West Bank,"JENIN, West Bank, May 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas deployed to the northern West Bank city of Jenin on Saturday for a law-and-order campaign meant to show the government is laying the ground for statehood. In a campaign dubbed ""Operation Smile and Hope"", jeeps and buses, which commanders said carried up to 600 security men, arrived in the city in coordination with Israel. Another 150 men already in Jenin, long a militant bastion, will join them. Washington, whose efforts for a deal on a Palestinian state this year have shown little sign of progress, sees the Jenin push as a chance for Abbas to prove he can rein in militants -- Israel's main condition for implementing a peace agreement. The deployment of the men, some of whom receive U.S.-funded training in Jordan, coincides with the start of U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's visit to the region on Saturday. In comments to reporters travelling with her, Rice urged Israel not to undermine the Palestinian security efforts. ""There have to be very insistent efforts to make sure that they are not being undermined,"" Rice said. General Diyab al-Ali, head of national security forces in the West Bank, told reporters in Jenin the deployment would lead to a Palestinian state. ""This is our country, our land and we will do our jobs regardless of what the Israelis do until we establish our own state,"" he said. A similar security push last year in Nablus was marred by Israeli army raids, travel restrictions and Israel's refusal to let the forces have certain equipment such as body armour. Western officials hope the Jewish state will be more cooperative in Jenin, but Ali said he had not received any assurances from Israel. The Israeli government has emphasized that ""ultimate security responsibility will remain in Israel's hands"". MILITANTS A senior Palestinian security official said the forces would target criminals such as car thieves, and had orders to confiscate illegal weapons, but stopped short of explicitly saying the campaign would target militants. Security men gave out leaflets to residents asking for help on tackling troublemakers and underlining that they alone have the right to carry guns. U.S.-backed peace talks were launched in November with the goal of reaching a deal before Bush leaves office in January, but Washington says neither side is doing enough to meet their obligations under a 2003 peace ""road map."" Under the road-map, Israel is meant to halt settlement activity and remove Jewish outposts. The Palestinians are meant to combat militants in the West Bank, where Abbas holds sway, and in the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by Hamas Islamists. Washington is keen to show security and economic progress in the West Bank before U.S. President George W. Bush visits Israel later this month. The Jenin operation will be accompanied by a series of economic development projects. Rice arrives on Saturday for meetings with Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. A senior Abbas aide said the two men would also meet on Monday and that the Palestinians expected Israel to produce maps showing the borders of a future state. The Jenin forces are expected to take up positions on Sunday. The campaign is supposed to last three months. Israel reoccupied West Bank cities -- seven of which had been under Palestinian control after the 1993 Oslo peace accords -- after the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising in 2000. One Palestinian security source in Jenin said Abbas's forces would be authorized to enter Jenin's volatile refugee camp and other areas that have been off-limits to Palestinian forces. Security has improved in Jenin over the last six months as militants from Abbas's Fatah faction turned in weapons as part of an amnesty program coordinated with Israel."

en.15.65.78.2008.5.1,Roma fans sign petition urging owners to sell,"ROME, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A petition by AS Roma fans urging the owners to sell the Italian soccer club to George Soros has been signed by more than 15,000 people after reports that the billionaire financier had pulled out of talks. Majority shareholder Italpetroli, controlled by the Sensi family, said last week it had met a representative of Inner Circle Sports, a global sports investment bank connected to the 77-year-old Soros. Media reports have said Soros has ended talks because of a lack of progress. Lawyers working for Soros refused to comment. Many fans believe the Sensis have taken Roma as far as they can and that new investment is the only way the club can take a step up and compete with the powerhouses of European soccer. ""Naturally fans like me have started to dream and hope for a great Roma like the great sides of Europe, competitive on every front. Our hope is that the Sensi family sells Roma to George Soros,"" read the petition, one of the 10 most active on popular website www.petitiononline.com. A source close to the situation said Hungarian-born Soros had offered 270 million euros ($421 million) and that there was a conflict between the family over whether to sell, with chief executive Rosella Sensi reluctant to do so. The source also said shareholder Unicredit had written to the Sensis urging a sale. A spokesman told media the bank was an ""interested spectator"". A joint statement on Wednesday from Italpetroli and AS Roma said there was no rift within the family. ""Contrary to some media reports, Italpetroli specifies that it has not received any letter from Unicredit,"" the statement added. Shares in Roma fell almost 10 percent on Tuesday when rumours started about Soros pulling out. Shares were up almost four percent on Wednesday. Roma, who last won the Italian league title in 2001, have done well to be second in the top flight this season but have ultimately failed to keep pace with leaders Inter Milan, who can wrap up the championship this weekend. Roma are in the semi-finals of the Italian Cup but were knocked out of the Champions League, Europe's premier club competition, by Manchester United in the quarter-finals. Roma fans have seen how investment in Manchester United, from American owner Malcolm Glazer, has helped the club to move forward and reach this season's Champions League final. Several other English clubs have been bought up by foreign tycoons but few sides in the rest of Europe have been targeted. The fact that Roma have been eyed has enthused supporters and even players such as Daniele De Rossi have talked about how extra investment from a big name such as Soros could boost the club on and off the pitch"

""No new gas connections are being given to any industrial unit in Chittagong for now,"" the chief adviser's special assistant Prof M Tamim told a seminar on the power sector Monday. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry organised the seminar on ""The present picture of the power sector and future development strategy"". Tamim, who oversees the power, energy and mineral resources ministry, said the government was also going slow in providing gas connections in Dhaka. The measure is temporary. ""Whatever measure has been taken to rationalise gas supply is purely temporary,"" an energy official explained to bdnews24.com. ""Things will be normal soon,"" the official added. But businessmen expressed worries over Tamim's statement and said its consequences would be ""very serious"". Tamim said: ""Connections will be given to the units about which decisions have already been taken. We are trying to sort out the problems of the power and gas sectors. I hope we will find new gas."" ""It is time we gave priority to the use of gas."" Tamim said: ""There was a fundamental mistake in our first energy policy. It should have specifically mentioned whether local energy would be used for supporting the economy or for increasing revenues."" ""It has not been made clear. It is time to take a decision in this regard. I think local energy should be used to support the economy,"" he said. ""We want to share infrastructure with the private sector. The private sector will be allowed to use distribution and transmission lines,"" Prof Tamim said. Replying to the questions of businessmen, Power Division secretary M Fouzul Kabir Khan said the irrigation season would officially end on May 15. ""Then power will be diverted from irrigation, which will improve the situation,"" he said. Petrobangla chairman Jalal Ahmed predicted that a gas crisis would set in by 2011. ""Production did not increase keeping with demand. The situation will deteriorate. Petrobangla does not have funds to invest."" FBCCI president Annisul Huq said: ""It is very frustrating for us.

en.15.65.339.2008.5.2,Inflation jumps to new three and half-year high,"NEW DELHI, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian inflation jumped to a fresh 3- year high in mid-April, and analysts said it is unlikely to ease soon as price pressures persist and fiscal and monetary steps will take time to have an impact. Data released by the government on Friday showed the wholesale price index rose 7.57 percent in the 12 months to April 19, above the previous week's 7.33 percent and outstripping market expectations of an annual rise of 7.38 percent. The government and central bank have rolled out a string of policy changes in recent weeks as inflation has soared. In the latest move, the Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday raised the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 25 basis points to 8.25 percent, its highest level in seven years, and said it was ready to act again if price pressures continued to build. Wholesale inflation now stands at its highest since Nov. 13, 2004, when it was 7.68 percent. The latest rise was largely driven by higher prices of foods, metal products, and industrial fuels. Economists expect the central bank to focus on draining inflation-fuelling cash from the system, while the government moves to fix supply-side problems. ""Across the board price pressures are there. We are yet to see the impact of monetary and fiscal measures,"" said Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank in Mumbai. ""These pressures would continue. The RBI will continue to focus on liquidity management as a monetary policy approach."" Speaking to reporters in the southern city of Bangalore, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said inflation would be contained but people would have to be patient. The markets remained cool to the data with the yield on the 10-year federal bond steady at 7.89 percent, while the rupee was at 40.64/65 per dollar, slightly weaker than 40.63/64 beforehand. The Congress Party-led coalition, under pressure from its allies, also unveiled new measures on Tuesday to tame inflation and guard food supplies, slapping export taxes on basmati rice and some steel products. Policy planners the world over are grappling with soaring food and raw material prices. But India, which has about 260 million poor, is especially sensitive to rising prices as food accounts for a much higher proportion of people's expenditure than in developed economies. Fighting inflation has become a top priority for the government as it heads towards a general election due by May 2009 and a series of key state polls this year"
en.15.65.161.2008.5.7,Zimbabwe parties challenge parliamentary results,"HARARE, Wed May 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF party and the opposition MDC have contested half the results of the March 29 parliamentary election, state media said on Wednesday, extending a stalemate that has triggered widespread violence. Official results showed ZANU-PF lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence in 1980, while the Movement for Democratic Change and a breakaway faction together secured enough seats to control the assembly. The fresh challenge to the election results by the two biggest parties could change the balance of power in the new parliament. The assembly can be sworn in during an electoral court's review of contested seats, but the court can remove deputies later if it overturns any results. The challenge will have no effect on the result of a parallel presidential ballot, however, which showed MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai won 47.9 percent against President Robert Mugabe's 43.2 percent, triggering a run-off since neither candidate won an absolute majority. The MDC has not said whether it will participate in the run-off. It believes Tsvangirai won the election outright and has ended Mugabe's 28-year rule over the once prosperous country whose economy is in ruins. If Tsvangirai does not contest the run-off, Mugabe is automatically declared the winner. The state-run Herald newspaper said ZANU-PF and the MDC had lodged 53 and 52 petitions respectively with the electoral court, citing irregularities they believed had affected the results. The challenges come after a recount of original results in 23 constituencies confirmed ZANU-PF's defeat. The court has six months to rule on the complaints, which dispute the results of exactly half of the 210 seats in parliament. To cope with the large number of challenges, the paper said Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku increased the number of electoral court judges from three to 20. HOPES DASHED A day earlier, independent Zimbabwean election monitoring group ZESN expressed doubt about the credibility of the results of the presidential election and accused ZANU-PF of attacking observers. ZESN, made up of 38 non-governmental organizations, said a one-month delay in announcing the results undermined the impartiality of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission. Zimbabweans, who had high hopes the election would usher in a new era of peace and prosperity, are victims of a protracted political logjam, as reports of violence increase. Tsvangirai left Zimbabwe shortly after the vote and has been touring African countries seeking support from leaders to help push out Mugabe, 84. He has left more junior party leaders in charge at home, where food and fuel shortages and hyper-inflation are affecting millions. Mugabe faces growing pressure from Western powers. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Monday he was talking to African states about how the world body could help make a run-off credible and expressed concern about the violence. The regional SADC group of countries, which have the best chance of influencing Mugabe, may be ready to press him to accept UN monitors. However, Mugabe, accused by critics of using security crackdowns to keep a grip on power, has not budged. The MDC accuses ZANU-PF of a violent campaign to intimidate Zimbabweans into voting for Mugabe in a run-off. The ruling party says MDC supporters have engaged in political violence"

ACC assistant director SM Sahidur Rahman turned in the chargesheet to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Md Golam Rabbani received the chargesteet. The ACC approved chargesheets against Khaleda and another former prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, and 18 others in separate Niko corruption cases on April 30. The graft watchdog filed the twin cases against the accused on Dec 9 last year. Khaleda and 10 others stand accused of costing the state coffers Tk 13,777 crore. ACC deputy director Mahbubul Alam filed the case against Khaleda. The case alleged that Niko Resources was ""very inefficient"" in different aspects, including technical know-how for oil explorations, but the deal was approved in violations of a proper procedure. The BNP-led government connived with Niko in implementing an ""illegal"" joint venture agreement soon after the four-party alliance assumed power in October 2001, it was alleged in the case filed against Khaleda. Niko applied to state minister for energy Mosharraf Hossain to close the deal, but some experts of Petrobangla and Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company (BAPEX) opposed the agreement, according to case details. Khaleda, the then prime minister, allegedly ignored opinions of the gas experts and took sides with Niko on the deal, costing the state Tk 13,777 crore in losses. bdnew"
en.15.65.27.2008.5.2,Dalai Lama envoys to travel to China,"New Delhi, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Envoys of the Dalai Lama will travel to China to meet the government over the crisis in Tibet, the government-in-exile said on Friday. ""During this brief visit, the envoys will take up the urgent issue of the current crisis in the Tibetan areas,"" the government-in-exile said in a statement on its Web site. After a crackdown on protests against Chinese rule in Tibet, an international diplomatic chorus earlier this year urged dialogue with the Dalai Lama. Beijing abruptly announced in late April that it intended to meet his aides. The envoys are due to arrive in China on Saturday for what the Tibetan side called ""informal talks"". ""We are hopeful that the Chinese are willing to address the Tibet issue realistically,"" Tenzin Taklha, a spokesman of the Dalai Lama, told Reuters from India, where the Tibetan government-in-exile is based. Despite the offer of talks, China has accused Tibet's exiled spiritual leader of manipulating opinion and governments in the West. China has blamed the exiled Buddhist leader's ""clique"" for unrest across Lhasa and other Tibetan areas, which it says was aimed at upstaging the Beijing Olympic Games in August."
en.15.65.380.2008.5.4,Torch arrives in China proper to thunderous welcome,"SANYA, China (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thunderous applause and cheers greeted the Olympic torch on Sunday as it began the first leg of its marathon relay through mainland China after a protest-harried overseas journey. ""Go China,"" people lining the streets chanted, waving Chinese flags as the flame made its way from a man-made island just off the tropical resort city of Sanya, on the southern tip of the island province of Hainan. Some of the thousands who turned out climbed up trees to get a better view of the torch, which has already been paraded through the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macau to an overwhelmingly enthusiastic welcome. ""As the first stop for the torch relay in mainland China, we are very honored and proud,"" Sanya's Communist Party boss, Jiang Zelin, told a carefully selected audience of dignitaries, celebrities and ordinary people, before the relay set off. The torch's five-continent journey was dogged by demonstrations, mostly over China's crackdown against protests in Tibet, which deeply embarrassed Beijing and provoked retaliatory rallies at home and abroad by patriotic Chinese. Talks with envoys for exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing blames for inciting the Tibet protests, were scheduled to start in southern China on Sunday. Some in the Hainan crowd wore nationalist T-shirts reading: ""Tibet was, is and will always be part of China"". Others wore T-shirts emblazoned with the calligraphy of Chairman Mao Zedong: ""A sea of red over the rivers and mountains of the motherland"". ""JOURNEY OF HARMONY"" Security in Sanya was low key but noticeable, with police speedboats patrolling offshore and officers helping marshal the crowds, where a carnival-like atmosphere prevailed. The chances of any further disruption to the torch relay as it snakes its way through China ahead of August's Beijing Games appear remote. ""The sacred Olympic flame relay will have a 'Journey of Harmony' through the land of China,"" organizers said in a statement, using a Beijing-coined phrase to express a sentiment much lacking in cities like London, Paris and San Francisco. Thoughts of Tibet and the problems that marred the global leg of the relay appeared to be far from the minds of the people who flocked to see the torch on Sunday. ""That we can reach the stage where we can hold the Olympics shows that we are a developed country which is becoming rich and powerful,"" Wu Qi, 23, a teacher from Hainan, said. Though the weather in Sanya was sunny and warm, meteorologists expect showers in the coming days across much of Hainan and relay organizers have prepared raincoats for the torch runners, a Website of state news agency Xinhua said. Chinese Olympic speed skating gold medalist Yang Yang was the first person to carry the torch. ""I don't believe this is real!"" she gushed in an interview with Xinhua. ""I have no way of describing how excited I am."" The torch will be carried by 208 runners -- including businessmen, celebrities, athletes and ""model"" Communist Party members -- and run over a course featuring both beaches and coconut groves, ending in the early evening. After Sanya it works its way up to provincial capital Haikou and then onto every province in China, including Tibet and the restive far western region of Xinjiang, where Beijing has accused al Qaeda of working with Muslim separatists."

The boat sank before 6 a.m. on the Solimoes River, about 50 miles from Manaus, a spokesman for the fire department in the town of Manacapuru told Reuters. It was returning an estimated 110 revelers from a party in the interior of the state, he said.

Forty-three fire fighters, including 16 divers, were participating in the rescue operation, which could take several days in the silty river, Dias said. Boats traveling on the many rivers in the Amazon region are frequently loaded beyond capacity and are seldom controlled by authorities. ""There are thousands of these boats in the region and strong currents in the rivers, so these accidents happen,"" said Dias."
en.15.65.274.2008.5.1,"Investors see recession, Wall Street depression","Wed Apr 30, BEVERLY HILLS, California (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - The U.S. economy may be in a funk, but that's nothing compared with the pall hanging over Wall Street. Some of the biggest U.S. investors said on Tuesday they expected the nation's economy to get worse, but then work its way toward recovery later this year. On Wall Street, however, the road back to health will take much longer. ""It is the Great Depression on Wall Street. It sure isn't on Main Street,"" Ken Griffin, chief executive of hedge fund Citadel Investment Group LLC, said during a panel at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California. According to Griffin and other top U.S. investors at the conference, the credit and housing crises that led to hundreds of billions of dollars in losses for Wall Street firms will take those investment banks years to claw back from. ""Until you see Wall Street put on their party hats again and get on the tables and start dancing is going to be years,"" said Ken Moelis, a former UBS banker who now runs his own investment firm, Moelis & Company. ""It will be a long time for Wall Street to come back to where it was."" Leon Black, billionaire investor and founding partner of hedge fund Apollo Advisors, said the banking system has been ""broken"" since last summer and has fostered a credit crisis ""the likes of which I've never seen in the 30 years I've been in the business."" Notwithstanding that, however, Moelis said he did not expect to see ""a deep Main Street recession."" In parts of the country, such as Pittsburgh, he said, business is booming thanks to soaring prices on commodities such as steel. ""They are looking for strategic deals and they are not interested in hearing how bad it is on Wall Street,"" Moelis said. Chuck Ward, chairman of Lazard Asset Management Group, and Peter Weinberg, a partner with ""boutique"" investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners, agreed that the U.S. economic downturn would likely be a short one. ""We are just starting to see the slide in the economy and I think that will play out over six months,"" Ward said. ""I don't think it will be a big recession. But by the end of the year I gotta believe that that's going to be behind us."" The stock market, which has been pummeled this year, will likely recover sooner, Weinberg said. ""I would say that the crisis starts to work itself out toward the end of the year and the equity market will sense that a bit before that,"" he said. Ward said, however, that he expected to see more job losses on Wall Street as investment banks struggle to regain their footing. It will take at least a year before they are fully back in the business of offering loans, said Apollo's Black. ""My guess is it will take six to 18 months, probably 12 to 18 months, before the banks are back lending,"" he said, adding that the leveraged buyouts of recent years would likely be ""on hold"" for up to 18 months. ""Competition in private equity,"" Black said, ""is going to be fairly dormant for the next 12 to 18 months. And even when it comes back, my guess is that it's not going to come back in the size that we've experienced in the last few years."" One investor, however, said he was less pessimistic, and expected to see small LBO deals later this year. ""You will start to see LBO activity for deals in the $3 billion to $5 billion range in the next six months,"" said Bennett Goodman, senior managing partner of hedge fund GSO Capital Partners LP, a unit of private equity firm Blackstone Group LP ."
en.15.65.65.2008.5.3,Gates says US could eye expanded Afghanistan role,"Texarkana, Texas, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Friday the United States could consider taking over NATO's command in southern Afghanistan, where some NATO allies have been reluctant to provide combat forces. But Gates said the Pentagon would consult closely with NATO allies, particularly those countries with combat forces in the southern region, before making any decision to alter its military role in the country. Southern Afghanistan, which has seen the worst of a rising tide of Taliban violence, is now under NATO command. Britain, Canada, the Netherlands and Australia all have forces in the region. ""This is a matter that's going to be looked at over probably some period of time primarily because it requires consultation with our allies,"" Gates told reporters when asked to comment on discussion at the Pentagon about the possibility of taking over command in southern Afghanistan. ""It certainly is worth taking a look at,"" he added. The United States has 34,000 troops in Afghanistan under two commands. About 16,000 soldiers under U.S. European Command serve as part of a 47,000-strong NATO force. A further 18,000 U.S. troops are in the country separately under U.S. Central Command. Gates was speaking during a visit to the Red River Army Depot in Texarkana, where the U.S. Army refurbishes and re-equips fighting vehicles for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""We need to look also at some of our own command and control arrangements. For example, does it continue to make sense to have two combatant commands involved in one country?"" the defense chief said. ""We're basically just trying to see how do you best provide for unity of command, how do you have the most effective operations possible in Afghanistan,"" he added. Violence in Afghanistan has risen sharply over the past two years to the highest level since U.S.-led forces invaded the country in 2001 and toppled the Taliban government in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. The United States has begun to increase its troop presence in the south where some NATO countries have been reluctant to send forces. Canada threatened briefly to withdraw its 2,500 soldiers from southern Afghanistan unless more NATO troops were sent to the region. The Canadians relented last month when France offered several hundred additional soldiers. But the French forces will go to eastern Afghanistan, allowing some of the U.S. troops deployed there to reinforce the Canadians in the south. About 2,000 of 3,200 U.S. Marines the Pentagon decided to send to Afghanistan earlier this year on a temporary deployment are also assigned to combat duties in the southern region."

Microsoft may raise its offer, now worth $42.2 billion, by a few dollars per share from an initial $31 per share to complete a deal as soon as this weekend, a person familiar with Microsoft's thinking said. But talks are at a ""sensitive stage"" and a deal is not certain, sources familiar with the situation said. Investors bet an agreement was likely, sending Yahoo shares up 7 percent to $28.67 on the first news of significant contact between the sides since Microsoft's deadline for its initial offer expired last Saturday. ""My sense is Microsoft is considering raising their price to the mid-$30s,"" said a San Francisco-based portfolio manager who owns both Yahoo and Microsoft shares, but would not be identified due to a company policy regarding shares that are actively traded. Yahoo had previously refused to enter formal negotiations with Microsoft, saying the initial price it made public in February did not properly value Yahoo's search and display advertising technology, or its overseas holdings. Every dollar added to the per-share price amounts to about $1.4 billion extra for the total deal at current prices, and Microsoft shareholders have questioned how much higher the company should go. ""If it's $35 or less, I think it's fine,"" said the portfolio manager, whose company owned 21.2 million shares of Microsoft and 1.93 million Yahoo shares as of the end of December. NO QUICK EMBRACE A deal could give Microsoft a stronger foothold in its battle with Internet search leader Google Inc, which is rapidly expanding into the software maker's own turf with new Web-based applications. Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer indicated on Thursday he might sweeten the bid after weeks of saying publicly that his offer was fair as it stood. ""I know exactly what I think Yahoo is worth to me, exactly,"" Ballmer said at a meeting with Microsoft employees. ""I won't go a dime above, and I will go to what I think it's worth if that gets the deal done."" Yahoo executives have repeatedly said the company was not averse to a deal with Microsoft at a higher price. But in a sign of its reluctance, Yahoo has courted a possible deal with Time Warner Inc's AOL division and a search advertising partnership with Google. Yahoo is still in talks on an alternative to the Microsoft bid, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. For its part, Microsoft has made clear it will not wait much longer. Ballmer said on Thursday that walking away was one of three options, along with striking a friendly deal or launching a hostile bid, and to expect an announcement shortly. Microsoft shares fell 0.5 percent to close at $29.24. Yahoo shares closed at $28.67, up nearly 7 percent on the day."

The match was interrupted after just over 30 minutes when teargas was sprayed from a section of the stands filled with PSG fans. It resumed after a 10-minute break. The 20-year-old Boli hit the back of the net after a brilliant solo run 12 minutes from the end. PSG, who often make unwanted headlines because of their unruly supporters, are third from bottom in the league with two matches left and in danger of being relegated for the first time.

en.15.65.181.2008.5.4,MiG-29 hearing deferred to May 11,"Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Sunday deferred a hearing on charge-framing in a graft case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, involving the purchase of eight MiG-29 warplanes to May 11. Judge Golam Mortuza of Dhaka Divisional Judge's Court, set up in the Sangsad Bhaban, shifted the date as former army chief Mustafizur Rahman, another accused in the case, failed to attend the hearing because of his illness. Lawyers for Rahman appealed to the court to defer the hearing for a month. But state counsels opposed the move and asked the court to begin the hearing. One of the lawyers said: ""Although the accused person is sick his lawyers are present. So it's possible to start the hearing."" The defence counsel said: ""As per the law the hearing should take place in the presence of the accused."" Earlier, the court on April 27 deferred the hearing to May 4 for the same reason. Hasina was taken from special jail to court around 9:40am Sunday. Abdullah Al Zahid, an official of the now-defunct Bureau of Anticorruption, filed the case on Dec 11, 2001 with Tejgaon Police Station against seven, including Hasina alleging malpractice. The case details said the government incurred losses to the tune of Tk 700 crore due to the skewed purchase of the eight MiG-29 warplanes in 1999 during Hasina's tenure as prime minister. Hasina had appealed to the High Court in 2003 to cancel the case, which was rejected, but the court stayed the case proceedings. bdnews24.com/lh/"
en.15.65.291.2008.5.4,Angry workers set fire to two launches on Buriganga,"Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  Authorities Sunday decided to run the activities of a pier, known as Masjidghat, east of Sadarghat, for one more month, hours after angry workers set fire to two launches on the Buriganga, protesting the closure of the pier, a BIWTA official said. The decision came from a meeting between the officials of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority and the officials of the district administration and the police. ""We have decided to run the pier one more month. Later it will be moved to a new place on discussion with all the stakeholders,"" BIWTA director Mahbubul Alam said. Earlier, deputy commissioner (DC) of Dhaka district Kamal Hossain and the district's superintendent of police (SP) Mahbub Hossain gave similar assurances. Md Badiuzzaman Badal, acting chairman of Bangladesh Inland Waterways Passenger Carriers Association, told bdnews24.com: ""Angry people have set fire to two of our launches and burnt down three others partially."" ""They also vandalised 15 launches and looted goods. Some 30 people were injured at that time,"" Badiuzzaman said. ""Launch operators will not bring their launches back to Sadarghat unless the authorities gave them any assurance."" ""The launch owners and workers are feeling insecure. The workers are moving their launches from Sadarghat to another place,"" he added. Angry workers set fire to two launches on the Buriganga after the BIWTA ordered the pier closed. Thousands of agitating people obstructed the fire fighters who had come to the scene to douse the fire and threw brickbats at the police. Sub-inspector of South Keraniganj Police Station Golam Mostafa told bdnews24.com: ""The police could not take any action as there were thousands of people there. If the police had taken action, the situation would have spun out of control."" Babul Dhali, a garment trader of Gudaraghat Alam Tower, said: ""Thousands of people use Masjidghat every day to go to the markets of Gudaraghat. There are around 150 markets around the pier."" The pier is 200 years old, Dhali said. The people found that the pier had been closed when they had come to work in the morning and set fire to two launches, Dhali said. Several launches were vandalised as they were trying to escape the scene, he added. Dhali said the situation compelled the police not to go for action and the firefighters initially could not do their job. The protestors took position in Gudaraghat and chanted slogans demanding the resumption of the pier. They became calm as the DC and SP the assured them that the pier would run its activities like before. bdnews24.com's Mitford correspondent said that the BIWTA officials, the police and the officials of district administration met for around two hours and cancelled the order to close the pier. The launch owners' organisation held a meeting at the same time and decided not to anchor their launches in the pier unless the authorities assured them of security. Sub-inspector of Keraniganj Police Station Abdur Rashid said Sunday morning: ""Agitating people set fire to the launches after the BIWTA ordered the pier closed."" ""We are finding it difficult to control the situation,"" Rashid said. The launches that came under arson attacks are Obhijan-3, which was bound for Barisal from Dhaka, and Riaz-4, bound for Fatullah. bdnews24.com"
en.15.65.7.2008.5.7,Mancini clashes with Inter owner over derby tactics,"MILAN, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini has disagreed with club owner Massimo Moratti's assertion that the Serie A leaders were too cautious and lacked courage in Sunday's 2-1 derby defeat by AC Milan. Inter could have retained their title with a victory but will now have to pick up three points against Siena on Sunday or at Parma in the final game of the season to be sure of the scudetto. Mancini's relationship with Moratti has been under scrutiny since the 43-year-old coach said in March he wanted to leave at the end of the season only for Moratti to say the next day that Mancini had changed his mind. ""We have never played for a draw in the derby or in other games,"" Mancini told a news conference on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's Italian Cup semi-final second leg at Lazio. ""I believe when you lose, everyone searches for a guilty party and that usually is the coach. If (Moratti) has seen it that way, he is free to do so, but I don't agree."" Former Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho has been heavily linked with the Inter post with Italian media unsure whether Mancini has totally changed his mind after March's outburst. ""I have a contract with Inter for the next three years, full stop. You are always asking the same question,"" Mancini said. The coach added that Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who has just returned to training after a knee problem, is a big doubt for the Siena game. ""To see him on the field on Sunday seems to me quite difficult. I don't know what the situation is now or what it will be in a few weeks given that there is also Euro 2008, which he holds dear,"" Mancini added"
en.15.65.428.2008.5.5,Malaysia drops idea of travel restriction for women,"Kuala Lumpur,May 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's home ministry rejected on Monday a proposal to impose restrictions on women traveling overseas on their own following an outcry from women's groups. Home (Interior) Minister Syed Hamid Albar said his ministry could not impose conditions requiring women to get written consent from their family before they can travel abroad alone. ""There cannot be (such) a rule,"" the national Bernama news agency quoted him as telling reporters. ""When a person applies for a passport, we don't ask them where they are going. A person who wants to travel, makes his or her own decision to travel and how they are going to do it is up to them."" Foreign Minister Rais Yatim said on Saturday both the foreign and home ministries mooted the idea in response to a string of cases where women traveling alone were used by international drug syndicates to smuggle drugs across borders. Women's groups over the weekend reacted with outrage, calling the proposal ""ridiculous"" and ""regressive"". One of the groups, Sisters in Islam, declined to speculate a hidden religious motive but said the idea assumed women were less capable than men to make decisions. At the weekend, Bernama portrayed the proposal as an anti-crime measure rather than a religiously inspired idea and said it aimed to ensure that a woman's family would ""monitor her departure and serve as a preventive measure against being duped"". Rais was quoted as saying that the idea came out of a review of criminal cases involving Malaysians abroad. In 119 cases of Malaysian women being brought before foreign courts, about 90 percent were linked to drugs, he said"
en.15.65.138.2008.5.7,US executes first inmate after moratorium,"Jackson, Georgia, USA, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia executed a convicted murderer on Tuesday, the first person to be put to death in the United States since the Supreme Court ended a de facto moratorium on capital punishment last month. William Earl Lynd died by lethal injection at a prison in Jackson, central Georgia, at 7:51 p.m. Lynd, 53, was convicted of shooting his girlfriend to death in December 1988. ""Under the order of the court, the execution of William Earl Lynd has been carried out,"" said Paul Czachowski, public affairs manager at the Georgia Department of Corrections. ""The condemned declined to make a statement or offer a prayer,"" he said, adding the execution began at 7:34 p.m. In the hours before Lynd died, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a final request for a stay filed by his lawyers. Lynd's execution is the first since the same court on April 16 rejected a challenge to the cocktail of three drugs used in most U.S. executions, which opponents had argued inflicted unnecessary pain. A nationwide pause in executions had been in effect since shortly after the court said on September 25 it would hear an appeal by two death row inmates in Kentucky against the use of the lethal drugs. Last year, 42 people were put to death in the United States, the lowest number since the 31 executions in 1994. But the 2007 number was artificially low because of the Supreme Court case. Fewer than 20 protesters opposed to the death penalty demonstrated outside the prison in Jackson where Lynd was executed in an apparent indication that the subject arouses few passions. Demonstrators said they also planned protests in five other cities in the state. ""It's sad that the state of Georgia has put someone to death and is leading the United States in the resumption of executions,"" said Laura Moye, chairwoman of Georgians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty. ""It is said it is a resumption of justice but instead we are being brutalized."" APPEAL REJECTED After shooting Ginger Moore three times in the head and face, Lynd buried her in a shallow grave. Soon afterward, as he drove to Ohio, he allegedly shot and killed another woman but was never convicted of that crime. The Georgia Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a bid by Lynd's lawyers to stop the execution. They argued that experts who described the murder scene in court had exaggerated. Several states have scheduled executions since the moratorium ended, including Virginia and Texas, which carries out more executions than any other state. Lynd is the 1,100th person put to death since the Supreme Court lifted a temporary ban on capital punishment in 1976. Since then, Texas has had 405 executions, followed by Virginia with 98. Lynd's last meal consisted of two pepper jack barbecue burgers with crispy onions, baked potatoes with sour cream, bacon and cheese, and a large strawberry milkshake, prison authorities said."
en.15.65.485.2008.5.6,US envoy urges China to use influence in Sudan,"Oslo,May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China should use its economic might to influence events in Darfur and its absence from an international donors' meeting on Sudan was disappointing, the US special envoy for the east African state said on Monday. Richard Williamson told Reuters in an interview that Sudan remained the ""world's biggest humanitarian crisis"" and called the violence in its Darfur region a ""genocide in slow-motion."" Williamson criticised China's absence from the start of an international donors' conference on Sudan on Monday. ""China is the country with the deepest economic involvement with the nation of Sudan -- they buy the bulk of Sudan's oil,"" Williamson said. ""I am told that close to 6 percent of the imported oil in China comes from Sudan."" ""So if they were to choose to use that influence constructively, they could have an impact, and one that other members of the international community would like to see them take,"" he said. International experts estimate some 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million been driven from their homes in five years of revolt in Darfur. Khartoum blames the Western media for exaggerating the conflict and puts the death toll at 10,000. Williamson said he told a closed meeting on Darfur in Oslo that there could be no progress on Darfur if the Comprehensive Peace Agreement unravelled. The 2005 peace accord ended 25 years of fighting between northern and southern Sudan. ""While there is an acute need for economic development in Darfur, no meaningful progress is possible until we have a secure situation,"" he said, calling reports on Monday of an air bombardment in Darfur ""extremely troubling and unacceptable."" ""NO PERMANENT ENEMIES"" The United States, which imposed economic sanctions on Sudan in 1997 and branded it a state sponsor of terrorism, has recently held out the possibility of improving ties and has presented Sudan with a long list of requirements. ""I have laid out the type of things that will be necessary on a long and difficult road to improve relations,"" he said. ""If they make a promise and deliver, and it has a concrete positive result, then we will look at some incentives."" He pointed to Washington's restoration of ties with Libya after Tripoli renounced weapons of mass destruction in 2003: ""With that dramatic shift, the United States showed it has no permanent enemies."" Williamson welcomed Sudan's pledge to provide security escorts for humanitarian convoys in Darfur every 48 hours. The World Food Programme last month warned it would have to cut back deliveries in Darfur by 50 percent without security and Williamson said the pledge would ensure thousands of tonnes of food reached the needy"
en.15.65.109.2008.5.7,How Obama got his momentum back,"Releigh, North Carolina, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Down on his luck two weeks ago, an annoyed Barack Obama complained, ""Why can't I eat my waffle?"" when a reporter tossed him a question over breakfast at a Pennsylvania diner on the eve of the state's primary. On Tuesday morning, when the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination sat down to an omelet in a Greenwood, Indiana, diner he seemed elated. Voters were streaming to the polls in Indiana and North Carolina as Obama chatted about his hopes and expectations and joked about his weight. The drawn-out struggle between the Illinois senator and his rival Hillary Clinton has had many ups and downs. But on Tuesday Obama won a compelling victory in North Carolina's primary while Clinton eked out a narrow win in Indiana. Obama's aides declared the candidate's momentum was back and it was only a matter of time before Clinton would be forced to exit the race for the party's nomination. ""We're nearing the finish line,"" said Obama's top strategist, David Axelrod. ""We have a lot to celebrate tonight and I think the Clinton folks have a lot to think about."" But if Obama is poised to wrap up the race soon, putting him closer to becoming the country's first African American president, it will be in spite of a series of setbacks he suffered over the past several weeks. In February, as he coasted to one victory after another, the confident and rhetorically gifted Obama was beginning to seem virtually certain to get his party's nod to face Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain in the November election. But he stumbled badly after video clips surfaced of the fiery sermons of his former pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Then, Clinton and McCain assailed Obama as an elitist after he made a remark about ""bitter"" small-town voters who cling to guns and religion. RENEWED VIGOR His losses in the Rust Belt states of Ohio and Pennsylvania led to questions about his electability because of his weak showing with white working class voters, traditionally a core Democratic constituency. Obama did little to help himself with a lackluster debate performance in Philadelphia in which he was put on the defensive about Wright, his patriotism and why he chose not to wear a flag pin on his lapel. He later expressed annoyance with the moderator's superficial questions and caught flak from reporters for his reluctance to take questions over the following couple of days. In the run-up to the April 22 Pennsylvania vote, Obama often seemed tired and talked of missing his two daughters who were at home in Chicago as he was having mixed success wooing blue-collar voters in pubs, bowling allies and diners. The low point for Obama came when Wright stepped back into the spotlight and unapologetically repeated his charges that the U.S. government bore some blame for the September 11 attacks and the spread of AIDS to blacks. Then, Obama did something he was reluctant to do before: he unequivocally cut his ties with Wright, saying he did not know his longtime pastor as well as he thought he did. A day later, Obama hit the campaign trail in Indiana with renewed vigor, taking a page from the tenacious Clinton and putting in longer days jam-packed with events like picnics and visits to roller rinks, aimed to show his ""regular guy"" side. His wife, Michelle, was by his side and they were joined on the weekend by their two daughters, Sasha, 6, and Malia, 9. A more relaxed Obama was comfortable and took questions from reporters frequently and appeared more spontaneous. He sometimes changed his schedule to engage with voters in a game of basketball, his favorite sport. The presence of Obama's wife and daughters also helped the campaign's effort to allow voters to get to know Obama in a more personal way. He talked often about his biography and his upbringing by a single mother and his grandparents. As the campaign marathon was coming to a close, Obama rose at 4:30 a.m. to do television interviews and visit workers on a construction site. He ended his day at midnight greeting workers at a car plants in Indiana as they came off the late shift. By early Wednesday morning, Obama was headed home. When his plane touched down in Chicago, he was grinning ear to ear. His aides told him that the Indiana results were still unclear but that Clinton's lead was very narrow. ""Good job"" he told his senior aides, just before leaving the plane."
en.15.65.256.2008.5.4,Obama wins Guam by a whisker,"HAGATNA, Guam, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democrat Barack Obama beat rival Hillary Clinton by just seven votes in Guam's nominating contest after record numbers of residents voted in the tiny U.S. territory's primary, officials said on Sunday. Results after more than 12 hours of manual counting showed Obama took 2,264 votes to 2,257 for Clinton. In the last Democratic primary in 2004 only 1,500 people took part. ""Clearly, both of them are quite popular and we should celebrate that,"" Josh Tenorio, Obama's campaign manager on the territory told Reuters. ""It's a good day for Guam."" With only four votes at the Democratic convention at stake, the contest on Guam, a Pacific island more than 20 hours by plane from Washington, will barely register in the protracted duel for the party's presidential ticket. Neither candidate made it to Guam -- instead both called into radio stations to campaign -- and many Americans have never even heard of it, but some islanders were thrilled to finally be in the spotlight. ""A lot of people were confused by the process,"" said Robert Lizama, a local mayor. ""It's brought a lot of awareness and participation. I think that's important."" ""We can't vote for president, but this is our part of the process."" Residents cannot vote in the presidential election but Guam, which is less than a fifth of the size of the smallest U.S. state of Rhode Island, sends eight delegates with half a vote each to the Democratic convention in August. Also on the ballot was the race for chairman and vice chairman of Guam's Democratic Party. ""I want change. He might change some things, like health insurance. It's expensive,"" said Ricky Castillo, 69, who voted for Obama. Clinton reminded voters about her multiple visits during stopovers on presidential trips with her husband to Asia and Obama emphasized his Pacific connections through his upbringing in Hawaii and Indonesia. Victory for Obama adds to his lead over Clinton but still leaves him short of being able to clinch the nomination to run against Republican John McCain in the November election. The next major contests for the Democratic nomination are on May 6 in North Carolina and Indiana. The two states have a combined 187 delegates at stake. While Obama leads in nominating delegates, Clinton has moved into a virtual tie with her rival in national polls after winning in Pennsylvania last month. Neither Obama nor Clinton is likely to reach the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the nomination without help from 796 ""superdelegates"" -- party officials and insiders free to back any candidate. Guam, which goes by the slogan, ""Where America's Day Begins"", will also send five superdelegates to the Democratic convention. It is a U.S. territory since 1898."

en.15.65.142.2008.5.3,Clashes break out in northern Yemen as truce falters,"SANAA, May 3(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Clashes erupted between Yemeni forces and rebels led by Abdul-Malik al-Houthi on Saturday, dealing a new blow to a faltering ceasefire a day after a mosque bombing killed 15 people in the northern city of Saada. Government forces killed five rebels, members of the Zaydi sect of Shi'ite Islam, in Saada, while rebels surrounded a government compound in nearby Manbah, local sources said. Hundreds of Yemenis demonstrated in Saada earlier in the day in show of anger against the attack that appeared to target army officers but killed a woman, two children and other civilians. Yemen has witnessed attacks by different groups targeting everything from tourists to government offices in recent years, but attacks on mosques were virtually unheard of until Friday. A security source said several suspects had been detained at a checkpoint in Saada and investigations suggested that Houthi's followers were behind the attack. Houthi denies the charge but fighting has raged on and off in Saada since a conflict broke out in 2004 between government forces and the rebels he leads. A Qatari-brokered truce ended six months of intense fighting in June but violence has increased in recent weeks as disagreements over the release of prisoners and handover of arms threaten to undermine the deal. Friday's bomb, which was hidden in a motorcycle outside the door of the Bin Salman Mosque and detonated as worshippers left, came as a Qatari delegation was meeting officials in Yemen to try to prevent a total collapse of the ceasefire. ""These crimes and violations are virtually daily and their perpetrators, the insurgent elements, have not implemented any terms of the agreement to end the strife of the insurgency but have refused to hand in their arms or come down from their positions in the mountains,"" the governor of Saada, Motahhar Rashad, told Yemen's Saba news agency. The ceasefire agreement committed Yemen to reconstruct rebel areas and required rebels to give up their heavy weapons. Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands have fled their homes in Saada since the conflict began. Seven Yemeni troops were killed on Tuesday in an ambush by the rebels and two were wounded in clashes late on Friday. Last month gunmen killed Yemeni lawmaker Saleh al-Hindi, who was known to support government efforts to subdue the rebels. Sunni Muslims form a majority of Yemen's 19 million population, while most of the rest are Zaydis. Yemeni officials say the rebels want to return to a form of clerical rule prevalent in the country until the 1960s. The rebels say they are defending their villages against what they call government aggression. One of the poorest countries outside Africa, Yemen is struggling with several conflicts on top of its economic ills. As well as fighting the Houthi revolt, the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden has cooperated with the United States since the September 11, 2001 attacks on U.S. cities. In the south, anger over perceived northern depredations exploded into riots this year that threatened to weaken the 1990 accord that united traditionalist north Yemen with the Marxist south."

Doctors at Anwer Khan Modern Hospital in Dhanmondi failed to say when her heart failed in the intensive care unit, where she lay for 10 hours after a dental operation. Rashida's relatives blamed the doctors for what they said was negligence of duty and wrong treatment that led to the death of the broadcaster. The hospital authorities denied the allegation. Hospital spokesman retired major Dr Muzibur Rahman told bdnews24.com: ""The heart attack happened anytime between 11:00 pm Tuesday and 9:00 am Wednesday."" ""There were two duty doctors beside the patient. It is difficult to understand when the patient suffered the heart attack as her ECG was normal for a long time,"" said the head of the pain therapy department at Modern Diagnostic Centre. ""The next day, on examination, it was found that she had suffered a heart attack and we started treatment instantly,"" Rahman said. ""There was no negligence,"" he claimed. The National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) associated professor Wadud Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that a typical change is noticed in 50 percent cases of heart attack, and an atypical change is spotted in 25 percent. The remaining 25 percent patients show misleading signs after a heart attack, and presumably Rashida was in the third group, he said. ""There was a chance of doctors making mistakes and starting treatment becomes too late. There was nothing to be done then,"" he added. ""Doctors should have checked the patient repeatedly after the operation and been more careful,"" Chowdhury said. ""It was unfortunate that the treatment was late,"" he said. Rashida was declared dead at LabAid Cardiac Hospital Thursday after she was transferred from Modern Hospital. Modern Hospital authorities said the patient had agreed to undergo general anesthesia. Prof Rahman said: ""Although general anesthesia has an impact on the heart, it is safer than any other forms of anesthesia."" Rashida was admitted to Modern Hospital in Dhanmondi with dental complaints. On the allegations of the family members, the doctor said: ""This is natural on the family's part. The fact is, the patient was given anesthesia following her permission. Later she was kept under intensive care."" ""She was transferred to LabAid Hospital after she had a heart attack,"" Rahman said. ""We won't protest the allegations of the relatives. The reality is, she died even after getting good treatment,"" he added. Anisur Rahman Babul, Rashida's cousin, told bdnews24.com: ""My sister died from the negligence of doctors. Her diabetes was under control."" ""She was given anesthesia before her teeth were extracted. But the dose of the anesthesia was extreme and she fell ill,"" he said. ""Her heart failed. Doctors did not give us proper information. There was no heart specialist there,"" Babul alleged. Doctors held a board meeting Saturday following a number of allegations over the death of Rashida. Prof Rahman, chief cardiac anesthesiologist, told bdnews24.com: ""Examining the data of the patient we have come to a decision that there was no negligence in treatment."" The patient's relatives including her sister Tahmina Zakaria, brother Shafiqul Alam and his wife as well as the driver observed the situation of the patient all the time, the doctor said. Dr Javed Iqbal Mahmud Pavel, who had treated Rashida for dental complaints, told bdnews24.com: ""The patient was admitted to the hospital with serious dental complaints. Four of her teeth, worn out earlier, had serious wounds."" ""Her diabetes was out of control. There was no alternative to an emergency operation."" ""Her teeth were extracted with the permission of the patient. She was given general anesthesia instead of local anesthesiaalso with her permission,"" the doctor said. Anesthesia specialist Dr Kamal Ibrahim of Bangladesh Medical College and Hospital in Dhanmondi, who doubles up at Modern Hospital, told bdnews24.com: ""The patient's diabetes half an hour before the operation was 7.8, which was uncontrolled."" ""The patient's blood pressure was 130/85. Her wound was from the mouth to the throat. She was given general anesthesia after her permission, as she would not be able to withstand local anesthesia,"" the doctor said. ""The operation was complete in 15/20 minutes. She regained consciousness. A few minutes later, she became restless. She was having breathing problems and sweating. She was given ventilation."" Prof Rahman said he had found water in her lungs Wednesday morning. ""She was given medicine, but the cardiac problem did not improve."" The patient needed urgent treatment at the time, but as Modern Hospital was not able to provide facilities such as angiogram, angioplasty and IABP, she was transferred to LabAid Hospital.

This week's devastating cyclone, which has killed about 22,500 people in the Irrawaddy delta, has exposed the fragility of that myth with potentially major long-term implications for the junta, analysts say. Many survivors of Cyclone Nargis's 190 km (120 miles) per hour winds criticised the army for a sluggish response, especially when compared with its willingness to flood the streets of Yangon with troops to crush last September's monk-led protests. ""The regime has lost a golden opportunity to send the soldiers as soon as the storm stopped to win the heart and soul of people,"" one retired civil servant told Reuters. ""But where are the soldiers and police? They were very quick and aggressive when there were protests in the streets last year,"" he said. Even though the junta appears to have overcome its deep distrust of the outside world in saying it welcomed foreign assistance, many residents of the city of 5 million are reluctant to believe it. ""They can't handle it on their own but I'm afraid they are too proud to accept assistance from the international community,"" one resident of Yangon told Reuters. ""Priority should be given to relief and resettlement, but I'm afraid the present situation is very bad."" In its coverage of the most devastating cyclone to hit Asia since 143,000 people were killed in Bangladesh in 1991, official media has given prominence to the military response. State television has shown footage of top generals handing out relief supplies at Buddhist temples or climbing into helicopters, and soldiers hacking away at fallen trees with axes and hand saws. But many in the country of 53 million people are likely to see such images as pure propaganda and are unlikely to be convinced, said political analyst Aung Naing Oo, who fled to Thailand after a brutally crushed 1988 uprising. ""They often want to show the people that they have enough in the country to handle any disaster. This is the message they always send out -- we don't need help,"" he told Reuters in Bangkok. ""But the myth they have projected about being well prepared has been totally blown away,"" he said. ""This could have a tremendous political impact in the long term."""
en.15.65.340.2008.5.1,"Japanese player says referee told him to ""die""","TOKYO, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Japanese referee has been accused by a player of using abusive language, including telling him to ""die"", during a J-League match. Oita Trinita's Taikai Uemoto said referee Yuichi Nishimura had also verbally abused him after the game when Uemoto said he would report the incident, Japanese media reported on Wednesday. The club confirmed they were compiling a file to send to Japanese officials, who have promised to launch an inquiry. Trouble flared when Uemoto asked Nishimura why he had not booked an FC Tokyo player for a foul late in the second half of Tuesday's game. Japanese media reported that several players overheard a furious Nishimura snap back: ""Shut up! You keep quiet and get on with the game. Die!"" Uemoto said Nishimura had made similar remarks and threatened to book him after the game. ""I was shocked,"" he told Japan's Nikkan Sports daily. ""If players said the same thing we'd be sent off. We don't have cards but that ref deserved a red. He was totally out of order."" Japanese officials are likely to take a dim view of the incident which comes days after a Kashiwa Reysol player was banned for four games for shoving a referee. ""We are taking this matter very seriously,"" Japan Football Association (JFA) general secretary Kozo Tashima said. ""We will decide on what measures to take after a proper investigation."
en.15.65.57.2008.5.5,UN sees world climate change deal in 2009,"Madrid, May 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The world can reach a significant new climate change pact by the end of 2009 if current talks keep up their momentum, the head of the United Nations climate panel said on Sunday. The United Nations began negotiations on a sweeping new pact in March after governments agreed last year to work out a treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol by the end of next year. ""If this momentum continues you will get an agreement that is not too full of compromises,"" said Rajendra Pachauri, head of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, during a seminar at the Asian Development Bank annual meeting in Madrid. Without a deal to cap greenhouse gas emissions around 2015, then halve them by 2050, the world will face ever more droughts, heatwaves, floods and rising seas, according to the U.N. panel. The United Nations hopes to go beyond Kyoto by getting all countries to agree to curbs on emissions of greenhouse gases that fuel global warming. Only 37 rich nations were bound to cut emissions under Kyoto. The United States, one of the world's biggest polluters, refused to join the agreement. The next talks, to be held in Germany in June, will address funding technology to mitigate climate change -- a key demand from developing countries who say rich countries should foot much of the bill. Getting the private sector on board with a well regulated carbon emissions trading system is key to long-term financing, according to delegates at the ADB seminar. ""Investors need some certainty they will get some return,"" said Simon Brooks, vice president at the European Investment Bank. PRESTIGE AND POLITICS India's Pachauri said popular awareness of global warming had risen sharply over the last 12 months and put pressure on Washington and other governments for action. He said he believed it would be very difficult for any country to remain outside a climate change pact. ""There's a question of national prestige involved,"" said Pachauri, head of the U.N. panel that last year shared the Nobel Peace Prize with former President Al Gore. President George W. Bush pulled the United States out of Kyoto in 2001, saying the pact would hurt the economy and was unfair since it excluded big developing nations from committing to emissions cuts. Key to a new agreement is Asia, notably China, said Odin Knudsen, a managing director for JP Morgan & Chase. ""China is making tremendous progress,"" said Knudsen, a specialist in climate change. ""It's in China's interests and they want to be energy efficient."" In the last 3 decades Asia's energy consumption has grown 230 percent and the region has gone from producing one tenth of world greenhouse gas emissions, to a quarter, according to the Asian Development Bank. The United Nations calculates global warming will cause a 30 percent decline in crop yields in central and south Asia by 2050 and decrease freshwater availability for over a billion people. Faced with such threats, China is switching over to renewable energy sources which are expected to provide more than 30 percent of its power needs by 2050, according to the United Nations. bd"
en.15.65.52.2008.5.5,Cyclone damage assessed in Myanmar,"Yangon, May 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities and foreign aid workers in army-ruled Myanmar struggled on Monday to assess the damage from a severe cyclone that killed more than 350 people and left tens of thousands homeless. State media said 20,000 homes were destroyed on one island alone after Cyclone Nargis, a Category 3 storm packing winds of 190 km (120 mile) per hour, ripped through Myanmar's Irrawaddy delta on Saturday. The death toll is likely to climb as the authorities slowly make contact with islands and low-lying villages in the delta, the rice bowl of former Burma. ""The government is having as much trouble as anyone else in getting a full overview. Roads are not accessible and many small villages were hit and will take time to reach,"" Terje Skavdal, regional head of U.N. office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), told Reuters in Bangkok. Teams of foreign aid workers were trying to assess the damage and aid needs, but their access and movements are restricted by the military, which has ruled the former Burma for 46 years. ""That is the existing situation for international staff. The way most agencies work is they use national staff who have more freedom to move,"" Skavdal said. ""We will have a dialogue with the government to try to get access to the people affected,"" he said. In Yangon, many roofs were ripped off even sturdy buildings, suggesting damage would be severe in the shanty towns that lie on its outskirts. State television was still off air in the former capital more than 48 hours after Nagris slammed into the city of 5 million. Clean water was becoming scare and with the electricity down, most shops had sold out of candles. In western Yangon, a group of 100 monks led efforts to clear streets littered with fallen trees and debris from battered buildings, a witness said. ""The clean up is beginning but this will take a long time. The damage around town is intense,"" one Yangon-based Western diplomat told Reuters. State media said 19 people had been killed in Yangon and 222 in the delta, where weather forecasters had predicted a storm surge of as much as 12 feet Official newspapers said only one in four buildings were left standing in Laputta and Kyaik Lat, two towns deep in the rice-producing region. Some 90,000 people were left homeless on the island of Haingyi, around 200 km southwest of Yangon on the western fringes of the Irrawaddy delta. United Nations disaster experts were due to meet in Bangkok, the capital of neighboring Thailand, later on Monday to assess Myanmar's needs and how best to respond. With many buildings damaged or destroyed, plastic sheeting was a high priority to provide shelter during the rainy season. Water purification tablets, mosquito nets and cooking equipment would also be needed, Skavdal said. Bunkered down in Naypyidaw, 240 miles to the north of Yangon, the junta's top brass has not formerly responded to an offer of international assistance. But UN officials met with Myanmar's Minister of Social Welfare on Sunday ""and the indication was assistance may be welcomed, but we need to understand the terms,"" Skavdal said. ""I think it's a positive sign. As long as we are in dialogue it is good,"" he said. The regime declared a disaster in five states and government television carried footage of soldiers clearing trees from roads and Prime Minister Thein Sein, a lieutenant-general, meeting people sheltering in a Buddhist pagoda. State media said on Monday that a referendum on a new army-drafted constitution would go ahead on May 10 despite the cyclone. ""The referendum is only a few days away and the people are eagerly looking forward to voting,"" the government said in a statement carried in the state media. The charter is part of a ""roadmap to democracy"" meant to culminate in multiparty elections in 2010 and end nearly five decades of military rule. The opposition and Western governments say it allows the army to retain too much control. Some flights to Yangon resumed on Monday. Nargis had weakened as it moved into western and northern Thailand on Monday, where there were no reports of damage or casualties. bd"
en.15.65.312.2008.5.2,"Olympic torch draws mass support, protest in Hong Kong","HONG KONG, May 2 (Reuters) - The Olympic torch was run through Hong Kong on Friday in a festive return to China after a troubled world tour, but tensions flared as patriotic crowds heckled protesters and police briefly detained eight activists. Security around the flame was tight on Friday, with roads closed, crowds kept at a distance, and at times as many as 16 Chinese torch security guards in blue and white track suits and police on motorcycles alongside the torch bearers. All along the torch's route, tens of thousands of cheering citizens packed sidewalks and strained for a glimpse of the flame as it winded its way across the territory by foot, dragon boat and horseback, as well as by yacht across the city's iconic harbour. Despite the outpouring of support, small bands of demonstrators confined to protest pens along the route demanded Beijing honour its Olympics human rights promises, but were confronted at times by bristling crowds. Early in the day, torch supporters surrounded and shouted profanity at a small group of demonstrators calling for religious freedom and brandishing a Tibetan flag. Police tried to prevent them from raising the flag and led the eight protesters to a van, along with a Chinese man who'd tried to snatch away their flag. They were later released and told they had been taken away for their own safety. ""It was a very dirty trick because I think it was a political decision to remove us 10 minutes before the torch got there,"" Christina Chan, one of the protesters told Reuters. Another lone elderly protester holding a placard urging dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama was circled by shouting bystanders who tore his clothing, called him a traitor and said he was ""mentally sick"". ""I was just expressing my opinion. What right do they have to treat me like this? They are uncivilised!"" said the man, 72-year-old cab driver Ng Pun-tuk. SOLEMN HONOUR Authorities in the former British colony have drawn criticism for taking an uncharacteristically tough line including blocking several people from entering the city, among them three pro-Tibet campaigners and a Danish artist and rights activist. The torch's five-continent journey has been dogged by protests, mostly over China's human rights record and Tibet, which have deeply embarrassed Beijing and provoked retaliatory rallies at home and abroad by patriotic Chinese. ""It is a great and solemn honour for Hong Kong, Asia's world city, to welcome back the Olympic flame on behalf of our proud nation,"" Hong Kong leader Donald Tsang said at the relay's start. A march by a pro-democracy group which holds an annual commemoration for the Tiananmen square crackdown in Beijing in 1989, was shadowed every step of the way by crowds of chanting Olympics supporters who tried to slow their progress. Elsewhere, Chinese university students waved national flags in front of protesters' banners, and shouted and sang the national anthem to try to drown out the calls for democracy. ""We are here peacefully to express our ideals that we love China and the motherland,"" said one, named Yu Xiang. Many expect the flame to now have a smooth run on Chinese soil with the possible exception of its Tibet leg in mid-June, leading up to the Aug. 8 opening ceremony in Beijing. In the United States, conservative and liberal members of Congress joined forces to urge a U.S. government boycott of the opening ceremonies of the Beijing Games, which start in August, accusing China of gross human rights violations. American actress Mia Farrow entered Hong Kong on Thursday to call on China to do more to end the violence in the troubled Darfur region of Sudan. She was questioned by immigration authorities before being allowed into the city and was told torch relay disruptions would not be welcome. After giving a speech in Hong Kong critical of Beijing's Sudan-friendly policy, Farrow lit a symbolic ""torch against genocide"" on Friday outside Hong Kong's government headquarters, calling on China to end the current genocide in Darfur. After Hong Kong, the torch goes to the Chinese gambling hub Macau and then starts its journey through the mainland. A sister flame is awaiting good weather to summit Mt. Everes"
en.15.65.483.2008.4.30,"Forty years on, France still fascinated by May 1968","PARIS Wed Apr 30,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Forty years after May 1968, France is enjoying a wave of nostalgia for the student revolt that rocked the streets of the Latin Quarter in Paris, fuelled by a never-ending debate about what it all achieved. Countless magazine supplements have shown the fashionably dressed student stone-throwers confronting phalanxes of helmeted police, and radio stations have replayed the breathless live reports that brought the riots directly into French homes. Television debates have pitted supporters who say the 1968 protests helped free up a hidebound society against critics who say they undermined vital institutions and opened the way to social breakdown. For some it has all been too much. Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the undisputed hero of the movement, called a recent book of interviews on the subject ""Forget 68"". ""All commemoration is stupid,"" Andre Glucksmann, another leading member of the 1968 generation told Reuters, ""Either you glorify May 1968 or you vituperate against it."" Sparked by a dispute over visiting rights to a female students' dormitory, the protests over university reforms and wider personal liberties led to three weeks of riots and sit-ins in the streets around the main Paris university, the Sorbonne. The crisis, which blew up into a general strike that paralyzed the country, was so serious that President Charles de Gaulle made checks to ensure the army would be ready to intervene if necessary. Kept alive by the perennial French fascination with revolution and street protests, the events have divided the country ever since. ""LIQUIDATE 1968"" Behind the confrontation, the surreal humor and idealism of the students, summed up in slogans such as ""Sous les paves, la plage"" ('Under the paving stones, the beach') and ""Never work"", remain the strongest image of the 1968 protests. Opposed equally to the conservatism of de Gaulle and a communist party they attacked as ""Stalinist"", the students were looking for something traditional politics did not offer, Glucksmann said. ""It was very happy, very cheerful,"" he said. ""But for me, it wasn't about enjoyment, it was above all, a search for truth and when you discover truth, it's astonishing, it's joyous."" But many conservatives say the carefree picture of youthful protest hid a malign disrespect for social institutions that has spawned ills ranging from high divorce rates to the violent riots that hit France's poor multiethnic suburbs in 2005. President Nicolas Sarkozy has been the most prominent recent critic, pledging during last year's election campaign to ""liquidate the heritage of May 1968"" and restore respect for traditional values. Sarkozy's attack has been derided by many who point out that he himself -- thrice married, most recently to an Italian fashion model -- could never have become president in the conservative world before 1968, when a woman still needed her husband's permission to open a bank account. But many veterans of the movement also acknowledge that the utopian vision behind the protests, while enormously powerful in many ways, was politically impractical. ""It marked society profoundly. Society has taken up all the good things about 1968,"" said Peter Schneider, a German writer who was a prominent activist at the time. ""But politically, thank God, it was a failure. We can count society lucky that we never got the chance to seize power,"" he said"
en.15.65.375.2008.5.2,Somali rebels defiant after al Qaeda chief killed,"Mogadishu, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somalia's Islamist rebels vowed to fight on under new leadership on Friday after US warplanes killed an insurgent said to be al Qaeda's commander in the Horn of Africa country. Aden Hashi Ayro, who led al Shabaab militants blamed for attacks on government troops and their Ethiopian allies, was killed on Thursday in the latest of a string of U.S. air strikes on insurgents in the last year. Security and intelligence sources say Ayro, in hiding since a U.S. air strike in January 2007, trained in Afghanistan in the late 1990s. He was one of six members or associates of al Qaeda thought by the United States to be in Somalia. The Western-backed Somali government is trying to stem a rebellion that has been gaining ground but the rebels said the death of Ayro would not deter them. ""Even if Ayro has been martyred, his beliefs live on. The men who he trained and consulted are still around,"" Shabaab spokesman Mukhtar Ali Robow told local broadcaster Shabelle. ""We are warning the enemies of God that we will stay on the same path like the departed ... the path of true jihad."" The pre-dawn U.S. strike on the small central town of Dusamareb flattened a stone house where Ayro had been staying and killed 30 other people, including Shabaab militiamen and civilians, witnesses said. The U.S. military said it had carried out a strike in Somalia against a ""known al Qaeda target"" but would give no other details. Ayro was a leading figure in masterminding the rebels' Iraq-style insurgency, which has intensified in recent weeks with scores of deaths in Mogadishu and a series of hit-and-run raids by the Islamists on towns outside the capital. Security analysts said the killing of Ayro was significant, but that al Qaeda penetration of Somalia meant he would be easily replaced. ""There are other leaders and so eliminating one will not end the insurgency,"" said Mark Schroeder, regional director for sub-Saharan Africa at risk analysis firm Stratfor. Shabaab is the armed wing of the Somalia Islamic Courts Council that took over most of southern Somalia for six months in 2006, until government troops backed by Ethiopian forces routed it in a two-week war. Western security officials have long seen Somalia as a haven for militants. Warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991, casting the country into chaos. Somalia-based al Qaeda operatives were suspected of carrying out two suicide attacks in Kenya that killed 224 people at the U.S. embassy in 1998 and 15 at an Israeli-owned beach hotel in 2002."
en.15.65.358.2008.5.2,"Blast at Yemen mosque kills 15, wounds 60","Sanaa, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Around 15 people were killed and over 60 were wounded when a bomb hidden in a motorcycle exploded outside a mosque in Yemen's volatile northern city of Saada on Friday, a security source said. The blast happened as worshippers, including army officers, were leaving the Salman Mosque after Friday prayers, officials and security sources said. ""It is a large mosque,"" the governor of Saada, Motahhar Rashad, told Al Jazeera. He earlier gave the Arab network an initial count of six dead and 35 wounded. But a Yemeni security source, who declined to be identified, put the death toll higher at ""around 15"" and said between 60 and 70 people were wounded. The security source said that the imam of the mosque, Askar Zaayl, was also the office manager of Ali Mohsen, Yemen's northern military commander who has led the government's fight against rebels loyal to Abdul-Malik al-Houthi -- a member of the Zaydi sect of Shi'ite Islam. Mohsen was not in the mosque at the time of the blast though other Yemeni officers were. It was not known who planted the bomb near the door of the mosque, but the northwestern province has been rocked by sporadic violence since a conflict broke out in 2004 between government forces and rebels loyal to Houthi. Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands have fled their homes in Saada since the conflict began. Seven Yemeni troops were killed late on Tuesday in an ambush by the rebels, who often clash with troops of the U.S.-allied Yemeni government and tribes loyal to it. Yemeni officials say the rebels want to return to a form of clerical rule prevalent in the country until the 1960s. The rebels say they are defending their villages against what they call government aggression. Sunni Muslims form a majority of Yemen's 19 million population, while most of the rest, including Houthi and his supporters, are Zaydis. Houthi's supporters, who are not believed to be linked to the Sunni Muslim al Qaeda oppose Yemen's alliance with the United States. One of the poorest countries outside of Africa, Yemen has been struggling with several conflicts in addition to its significant economic challenges. As well as fighting the Houthi revolt, Yemen has witnessed several attacks on oil installations, government compounds and French and U.S. ships. The ancestral home of Osma bin Laden has cooperated with the United States on security matters since the September 11, 2001 attacks on U.S. cities. Shells landed on a government compound near the Italian embassy in Sanaa on Wednesday. A similar attack hurt 13 school girls near the U.S. embassy in March. In the south, anger over perceived depredations exploded into riots earlier this year that threatened to undermine the 1990 accord that united traditionalist north Yemen with the Marxist south."
en.15.65.225.2008.5.6,Iraq war strains US army mental health system,"FORT DRUM, New York, Tue May 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fort Drum, a bleak US Army base in upstate New York, is a test case for how the military is handling a looming mental health crisis. The military and its critics agree on one thing -- there are not enough therapists to treat all the soldiers who return from Iraq and Afghanistan traumatized by the experience. The 10th Mountain Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team (2BCT) is the most-deployed brigade in the US army since 2001. It served two tours in Afghanistan, totaling 11 months, and was sent to Iraq twice for tours of 12 and 15 months. ""They're kind of a canary in a coal mine,"" said Paul Rieckhoff, a former Army captain who founded the advocacy group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. ""They're a good barometer to understand the human cost of the war."" A report by advocacy group Veterans for America said the mental healthcare system at Fort Drum was not meeting the demands placed on it and had prepared inadequately for the return of more than 3,500 soldiers from Iraq late last year. ""Even though we knew this group were coming back from their 4th deployment and there would be these problems, we still had massive waits of two months (for appointments),"" Veterans for America spokeswoman Adrienne Willis said. The report, released in February, said there were not enough counselors, psychologists and psychiatrists, there was too much reliance on group therapy over individual care and there was a lack of continuity in care. The lack of a hospital on base was also a problem. It said commanding officer Gen. Michael Oates deserved ""commendation"" for setting the tone that psychological wounds were legitimate combat wounds. Nevertheless, the stigma of mental problems kept many soldiers from speaking up, it said. Todd Benham, head of Fort Drum's behavioral health department, attributed long wait times to a lack of staff. He said the unit had plans to expand but it takes time to recruit, particularly in a rural area such as Fort Drum. ""It's definitely a crunch, it's difficult recruiting and certainly it's more difficult up here,"" Benham said. ""I don't think anybody is pretending the stigma has gone away or we didn't have significant wait times for a while,"" Benham said. ""We understand there was an issue."" ""Yes, we recognize Fort Drum needs some help, but that's something we've been working on for a year or more,"" he said. GROWING CASE LOAD Benham said visits to the clinic have risen from about 14,000 in 2001 to 26,000 expected this year. There was a big jump from 2004 to 2005 when the unit started screening all returning soldiers for mental health problems. Post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, can result from wartime trauma such as wounds or witnessing others being hurt. Symptoms include irritability or outbursts of anger, sleep difficulties, trouble concentrating, extreme vigilance and an exaggerated startle response. Christopher Smith, 23, a tank mechanic who served in Ramadi, returned from Iraq in January 2006 and left the army. In the following six months, he grew increasingly withdrawn and isolated and was unable to hold down a job. Despite what his wife Cara says were clear signs of PTSD, he managed to re-enlist in December 2006 without the recruiter noticing a problem. Sent to Fort Drum, he was diagnosed with PTSD and judged undeployable. He has been on a string of different medications, none of which he says have worked. ""It's so frustrating,"" Cara Smith said, describing the base as unfriendly and depressing. ""The doctors up there, they say 'Come to group therapy, we'll help you.' But because of his duty and his orders and stuff he has to do, he missed two group therapy sessions and got kicked out of group therapy,"" she said. Now, she said, he has a 30-minute individual therapy session around every six weeks. ""It's not really therapy, it's more of a medication appointment,"" she said. About 300,000 troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer PTSD or depression, or one in five of the more than 1.5 million who have deployed, according to a report by RAND Corp. Around 17,000 troops are based at Fort Drum, a sprawling base near the Canadian border that endures bitter winters. Around 4,000 of those are in Iraq. Most soldiers in the 2nd brigade will not have served all four tours, but some senior non-commissioned officers have deployed three or four times. Military studies show those on repeat deployments are more prone to PTSD. Benham said his department has 35 staff in its three clinics, which cover mental health services, social work and substance abuse. Three more positions will be filled within a month and there are 16 vacancies. ALCOHOL ABUSE Several soldiers interviewed by Reuters said the first weeks back for many younger soldiers was devoted to drinking. ""The first month back, everybody got drunk, pretty much,"" said William Buehler, 23, adding that as a married soldier he did not participate in such drinking. ""You've been gone 15 months, that's what everybody wants to do,"" he said. Among a series of incidents fueling concern about drinking, a Fort Drum soldier was arrested in March and charged with vehicular assault while intoxicated after ploughing his car into a crowd outside a nightclub, injuring seven soldiers. In an effort to shame those who go too far, Gen. Oates decided in March to print the names and photographs of soldiers arrested for drink driving in the base newspaper. Several soldiers interviewed on base praised the move as a good deterrent, but Willis of Veterans for America said many of those named were in the brigade that just came back from Iraq. She said while nobody would justify drink driving, it was important to examine the link to combat stress. ""They're making it the full responsibility of the soldier when the rest of the world has come to realize alcohol is a symptom of PTSD."" Tom Berger, chairman of a PTSD committee at the Vietnam Veterans of America, said alcohol abuse was typical. ""A lot of these folks, all indications are they're self-medicating. They come home and they try to deal with this stuff with a 12-pack (of beer),"" he said"

Chief Executive Tom Glocer said the results and outlook reflect the robustness of the recently combined business, even in turbulent markets. ""Thomson Reuters is extremely well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand across the world's business and professional communities for intelligent information,"" Glocer said in a statement. Thomson, a Canadian publisher of professional services databases and financial information, bought Reuters on April 17 for more than $16 billion in cash and stock. Pro forma first-quarter underlying operating profit was $579 million, a rise of 37 percent from a year ago, assuming that Thomson and Reuters had been one company at the time. Pro forma revenue for the quarter ended March 31 rose 12 percent from a year ago to $3.3 billion. Thomson Reuters forecast underlying profit margin to be between 19 and 21 percent for 2008, with free cash flow margin, excluding synergy and integration costs, to be between 11 and 12 percent of revenue. In the first quarter, the new company's markets division, which includes the Reuters and Thomson news operations, as well as their financial services data and tools, reported operating profit of $353 million, up 69 percent. The professional division, which includes databases and tools for accountants, lawyers and tax professionals, reported operating profit of $299 million, up 6 percent.

en.15.65.337.2008.5.6,US says Iran will get incentives `very quickly',"Washington,May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World powers very soon will present Iran with a revised package of incentives to give up its sensitive nuclear work, US officials said on Monday, but expectations for a positive response are low. ""I think this will move very quickly,"" said a senior US official, when asked when the incentives package agreed on by major powers in London last Friday would be formally offered to the Iranians. Top government officials in China, Russia, the United States, France, Britain -- the permanent members of the UN Security Council -- and Germany are now reviewing the decision made in London and an approach would be made soon to Tehran, the official said. France has said it could be within days. The incentives are based on an offer first made to Iran in June 2006, which diplomats say has been ""refreshed"" to include enhanced nuclear cooperation but do not differ substantially from the first one. ""It is not a major step forward, frankly, because we think it was a very good offer in the first place. We simply don't understand why the Iranians have not put more interest in it,"" the senior US official told Reuters. ""It doesn't augur well for a reaction, given what they have said already,"" he added, anticipating Iran's formal response. Iran said on Monday it would not consider any incentives that violated its right to nuclear technology, ruling out a precondition to halt atomic work the West believes is aimed at making bombs. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful power purposes. ""It is nice to see, I guess, that they are keeping such an open mind about this by rejecting it before they have even seen it,"" said State Department spokesman Tom Casey when asked about Iran's comments. DIFFERENCES The incentives offered in 2006 included civil nuclear cooperation and wider trade in civil aircraft, energy, high technology and agriculture, if Tehran suspended enrichment and negotiated with the six powers, including the United States. ""What the offer does is that it underlines that we (the United States) are interested in having a relationship with these guys (Iran),"" said the U.S. official. He said Russia and China, which are reluctant to impose further punitive measures on Iran, had pushed for ""troublesome"" additions to the package but these were not included. ""They were looking at a definitively different offer ... They wanted more political facilitation and they wanted more flexibility on certain aspects of nuclear cooperation,"" the official said, while declining to provide further details. Casey and other US officials said if Iran continued to turn down the offer, it faced more international pressure in the form of sanctions and other punitive measures. ""It is a hard slog but we will continue upping the pressure and we have been fairly successful upping the pressure ... The United States is always looking at tougher sanctions on Iran,"" said the senior official. He said European Union foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, would likely present the offer to the Iranians but this had not been agreed on yet and it was not yet clear who it would be given to on the Iranian side. It was unlikely a formal deadline would be given to the Iranians as these had been hard to adhere to in the past but this was still under discussion, he added"
en.15.65.315.2008.5.4,All set for AL's mass hunger strike Monday,"Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League observes a mass hunger strike programme in the capital Monday to put pressure on the government to release party chief Sheikh Hasina and send her to the US for treatment. Acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam Sunday said they were putting final touches to the preparation for the programme. The six-hour hunger strike would be held simultaneously at the AL headquarters on the Bangabandhu Avenue and at the party president's political office at Dhanmondi from 10am to 4pm. Hasina, the former prime minister detained on corruption charges early last year, has been suffering from various health complications and treated in Dhaka several times. Her party insists on her being sent to the US for better treatment. Ashraful said the central working committee of the party will meet after the mass hunger strike to decide on the next programme. He went to the Dhanmondi office in the morning and directed party's deputy publicity and publication secretary Ashim Kumar Ukil and deputy office secretary BM Mozammel Haque to prepare for the programme. Ukil told bdnews24.com that the central leaders would stay in two big rooms in the Dhanmondi office during the programme, while Mohila Awami League and Jubo Mohila League will stay on the premises outside the office. The leaders and workers of the party's Dhaka city unit and front organisations will stay at the central office on the Bangabandhu Avenue. A token hunger strike throughout the country for April 29 was announced from the AL presidium meeting on April 23. But the government did not give it the go-ahead to hold the programme and the presidium at another meeting on April 27 decided to observe the programme only in Dhaka city and pushed the date to May 5. The AL wrote to Dhaka Metropolitan Police Saturday to take measures for the programme. Later in the day, after the presidium meeting, Ashraful told journalists that they had got permission to hold the programme on May 5. bdnews"
en.15.65.453.2008.5.1,Finance Minister expects state-run banks to hold rates,"NEW DELHI, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's state-run banks are unlikely to raise rates after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tightened bank reserve requirements this week, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said on Thursday. In its second move in just a few weeks to drain liquidity from the banking system, the RBI on Tuesday raised the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 25 basis points to 8.25 percent, its highest level in seven years, with effect from May 24. The central bank signalled it was ready to act again if price pressures continued to build. Wholesale inflation, India's main measure, is running at more than 7 percent, close to three-year highs. ""By and large banks have welcomed and appreciated the stance of the RBI. They were quite happy that only the CRR had been hiked and policy rates have been untouched,"" Chidambaram told reporters after meeting chiefs of state-run banks. ""They do not expect the CRR hike to impact the interest rates. So going forward in the reasonable future I don't expect any increase in interest rates by state-run banks."" Chidambaram, who reviewed the performance of state-run banks, said they had reported loan growth of 24.5 percent in the fiscal year ended March. Farm loan grew by 23.33 percent and personal loans were up by 16.3 percent. Among the personal loans segment, housing loan grew by 16.44 percent and vehicle loans 23.01 percent. Chidambaram also said state run banks gross non-performing assets ratio declined to 2.17 percent in the fiscal year ended March from 2.7 in 2006/07 and net bad loans dipped to 0.98 percent from 1.1 percent. India had 82 commercial banks, including 29 foreign banks, and nearly 3,000 urban and rural cooperative banks as of March 2007. The sector is dominated by state-run banks. The finance minister said he expects the state-run banks to perform strongly in 2008/09, the current fiscal year, and urged them to review their derivative portfolios and make sure customers understand them fully. Several Indian firms are taking their banks to court over foreign exchange derivatives trades which have gone sour, alarming policymakers and casting a pall over a growing but still underdeveloped area of the market"
en.15.65.417.2008.5.7,Google in driver's seat after Microsoft-Yahoo bust,"NEW YORK, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Yahoo Inc may not be celebrating the end of takeover talks with Microsoft Corp, but their mutual rival Google Inc should feel free to pop the champagne cork. The rift between Microsoft and Yahoo leaves the online advertising market wide open to Google's expansion. What's more, it puts Google in the coveted position of deciding the fate of its closest rival, analysts said. Microsoft withdrew a $47.5 billion offer for Yahoo on Saturday after the Internet company dug in for a higher price. Yahoo investors see only two viable options - returning to negotiations or letting Google serve up some of its search listings since it makes more money off the ads. With Microsoft holding firm for now, that leaves Google in the driver's seat when it comes to determining Yahoo's fate. ""It's good news for Google. They will continue to grow their dominant share,"" said Jane Snorek, senior technology analyst at First American Funds. ""In the long run, I just think the Yahoo customer would go directly to Google."" Google and Yahoo are still working out the details of a potential search deal and are sharing the plans with antitrust regulators to dispel concerns, a person close to Google said on Monday. But no final agreement has been reached yet. A deal be would icing on the cake for Google, adding about $1 billion in annual revenue and about $1 to earnings per share, assuming a 50-50 split on ad revenue, Snorek said. While Google doesn't need the partnership on its own account, it may have a defensive interest in reaching a deal. ""They're doing it more as a favor,"" she said. ""Google can't let Yahoo fall to $15 again because they can't have Microsoft buying Yahoo."" An ad deal with Google could add as much as $6 a share to Yahoo's stock price, based on the results of a test between the two companies, a person involved in the discussions said. THERE GOES THE COMPETITION Yahoo, however, is now viewed in need of a deal to prop up its value after rejecting a $33-per-share offer from Microsoft. Chief Executive Jerry Yang insisted the company is worth $37 per share, but Wall Street doubts it can get there alone. Google last month waved off fears that it would suffer from a U.S. economic downturn, reporting 42 percent gross revenue growth in the first quarter. Yahoo posed a 9 percent rise for the period, or 14 percent excluding payments to ad affiliates, and expects 3 percent to 15 percent growth for the full year. Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay estimates Yahoo's stand-alone value at closer to $25 per share, leaving out any deal with Microsoft or Google. Yahoo shares closed at $25.72 on Tuesday. ""If it turns out that Google was just being used to thwart Microsoft, I think the investor reaction will be very negative,"" he said. While Google is by far the leader in search, a combined Microsoft and Yahoo could have presented a challenge in new frontiers of online advertising, from Web video to messaging and mobile Internet. ""That's where there is open territory for anybody to win. Google stands to continue to further distance themselves from the pack,"" said Dan Davidowitz, portfolio manager at Polen Capital Management which owns shares in Microsoft and Google. On the flip side, a Yahoo-Google alliance is widely expected to draw regulatory scrutiny for combining the Internet's two largest players. Sarah Fay, CEO at media buyer Aegis Media North America, said a combination of the two would be the closest thing yet to a monopoly in the online advertising space. ""What Google is missing now is true depth of offering in display, e-mail and instant messaging, and those are areas where Yahoo is very strong,"" she said. ""It feels a bit like too many eggs in one basket."" Derek Brown, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said Yahoo should still think twice before it gives up even a segment of its search after investing to upgrade its technology. ""If part of Yahoo's mission is to become a one-stop shop for people looking to buy all types of online ads, then outsourcing search ... seems like a step backwards,"" he said. But if Yahoo's ultimate aim was to avoid Microsoft's embrace, a long-term Google deal could buy it time to advance elsewhere while warding off the unwanted suitor. ""It's more of a poison pill if they don't have an out clause ... and it's multi-year,"" said Todd Dagres, general partner at venture firm Spark Capital"
en.15.65.272.2008.5.6,Court resets Hasina hearing for May 12,"Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has reset the next hearing for May 12 in a graft case against Sheikh Hasina involving 'illegal contracts' for setting up three barge-mounted power plants during her term as prime minister. Judge Md Feroz Alam of the Special Judge's Court, set up in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, re-fixed the date Tuesday after hearing a plea to withdraw all charges against former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, another accused in the case. Hasina was taken from special jail to court around 9:45am. The court on April 30 wrapped up the hearing on a similar plea by Hasina to quash the charges against her. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon police on Sept 2 last year against eight people, including Hasina. The graft watchdog accused the former prime minister and the others of being involved in the exchange of Tk 3 crore in bribes from Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium's local representative, and Summit Group and United Group representatives, for awarding the contracts to set up three power plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. Other accused in the case are former chairman of the Power Development Board Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. Of the accused, Hasina and Toufiq-e-Elahi are currently behind bars. bdnews"
en.15.65.316.2008.5.2,UK House prices post biggest fall since 1993,"LONDON, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - House prices in UK took their steepest annual fall in 15 years in April, data from the country's biggest mortgage lender showed on Friday, stoking fears of a deep downturn this year. The weak figures from HBOS come after a Bank of England policymaker warned house prices could fall by more than 30 percent and add to the woes of Prime Minister Gordon Brown, whose Labour party has suffered heavy losses in local government elections. ""This is a dark cloud that is getting ever darker for the economy,"" said Alan Clarke, an economist at BNP Paribas. House prices fell 1.3 percent on the month to 189,027 pounds last month, the third monthly decline in a row, leaving prices 3.7 percent lower than April last year. That was the biggest yearly decline since June 1993, analysts said, when the British economy was still in the throes of a protracted housing slump. ""We expect house prices to fall 7 percent in 2008 and 9 percent in 2009,"" said Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight. Bank of England arch dove David Blanchflower said this week the economy could fall into a recession and house prices could dive unless policymakers acted immediately to shore up growth. But most analysts expect the central bank to wait until June before trimming rates again, having already reduced them three times since December, as inflation is running high despite the slowing economy. More than 25,000 people declared themselves insolvent in England and Wales in the first three months of the year and while that was 13.2 percent lower than the same period of 2007, analysts warned the outlook was grim. BANKCRUPTCIES ""The effects of the credit crunch are only just showing up in some of the hard data, so it is premature to expect the data to show a tidal wave of insolvencies at this stage,"" said Clarke at BNP Paribas. ""However, this will come and become an increasingly prominent issue along with repossessions towards the end of the year,"" he said. Activity in Britain's construction sector fell for the second month running and at its fastest rate since December 1998, according to a survey by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply published on Friday. While the housing downturn is gathering pace, prices have nearly trebled in the last decade and analysts said record levels of employment suggest the market is not about to crash as it did in the early 1990s. The Nationwide building society reported the first annual decline in house prices in 12 years in April and a record high proportion of surveyors are reporting falling house prices across the country. Last month, Halifax reported house prices falling 2.5 percent on the year, the fastest monthly rate of decline since 1992"

Under the plan of the project, emitted carbon dioxide from a thermal power plant will be injected into a major Chinese oil field to extract more crude oil, the Nikkei business daily said. The project, set to start next year, will involve investments from Japanese companies such as Toyota Motor Corp and plant engineering firm JGC Corp, Nikkei said. From China, entities such as China National Petroleum Corp and major power generator China Huadian Corp are expected to take part in the project. The cost is estimated to total about 20-30 billion yen ($190-$285 million), but details on how the costs will be shared have yet to be determined, the daily said. The two countries are expected to sign an accord on the project next week when Chinese President Hu Jintao visits Japan. Hu's five-day trip from Tuesday will be his longest state visit to any one country since he became president in 2003. Nikkei said carbon dioxide from a coal-fired power plant in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province in northeast China, will be transported to Daqing oil field, located about 100 kilometers west of the plant. The plant emits more than 1 million tonnes of CO2 a year. Daqing produces about 40 million tonnes per year of crude oil, the daily said. CO2 will be used to make crude oil more liquid and easier to extract, resulting in an increase in output in Daqing of about 1.5-2 million tonnes a year, Nikkei said. CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants into the atmosphere can be reduced to essentially zero by using the technology, Nikkei said. Kyodo news agency, quoting government sources, reported on Friday that the two countries will agree to strengthen ties in global warming in developing advanced environmental technology. Kyodo said China will take notice of Japan's proposal for the world to halve greenhouse gases by 2050 and the world's No. 2 emitter was studying measures to help Japan achieve the goal. Japan, the world's fifth largest emitter, is set to host the Group of Eight summit in July. Climate change is expected to be at the top of the summit agenda, with countries across the world working on a new framework to cut global carbon emission beyond the 2012 expiry of the Kyoto Protocol. Japan is promoting the concept of sectoral emission targets for industry, but Europe and some developing nations have questioned the concept. ($1=105.32 Yen)"

""It was not an easy day for me,"" said the Israeli manager, whose father survived the Holocaust but had to bury his own parents and sister ""with his own hands"". ""I'm proud with what we achieved on this dayit was an emotional day,"" said Grant, whose Chelsea team will meet Manchester United in the final next month in Moscow. Chelsea beat Liverpool 3-2 for an aggregate 4-3 victory to reach the Champions League final for the first time and Grant fell to his knees apparently in prayer after the final whistle. ""My father is a survivor of the Holocaust,"" he said. ""It puts it in some perspective. It wasn't easy but now it's a happy day,"" Grant, who plans to visit Auschwitz on Thursday added. He also praised the courage of midfielder Frank Lampard, who returned to play after his mother died last week and wept after scoring from the penalty spot for Chelsea's second goal. BRAVE MAN ""He is a brave man. He was very close to his mother. It was his decision to return,"" Grant said, adding he had selected the England midfielder to start after watching him train on Tuesday. The dour Israeli, who has struggled for popularity with fans after taking over from charismatic predecessor Jose Mourinho last September, said it meant a great deal to him to ""make history"" with Chelsea in his first year in charge. ""I needed to prove more than others that my team knew how to play football, knew how to overcome difficulties and knew how to create history,"" he said.

en.15.65.228.2008.5.3,"Brown`s party routed in UK elections, loses London","London, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Labour Party suffered its worst local election defeat on record and lost control of London on Friday, forcing Prime Minister Gordon Brown to rethink his strategy to avoid losing the next national poll. Conservative Boris Johnson, a journalist-turned-lawmaker prone to gaffes, wrested the prized post of London mayor from Labour's maverick Ken Livingstone, who has run the sprawling metropolis of some 7.5 million people since 2000. The election results were a major blow to Brown, who enjoyed a brief honeymoon with voters after he took over from Tony Blair, but has since been beset by economic turmoil, industrial unrest, administrative blunders and an image problem. Contrite Labour ministers and lawmakers said the government had failed to address Britons' fears of rising food and energy prices, higher mortgages and a possible housing market slump. The question now is whether the rout was just mid-term blues from which Labour can recover before the next general election, due by mid-2010 at the latest, or whether the tide has turned towards the Conservatives. Accepting the post, Johnson said he hoped his victory represented a turning point for the party which has been in opposition since Blair swept to power in 1997. ""I do not for one minute believe that this election shows that London has been transformed overnight into a Conservative city but I do hope it does show that the Conservatives have changed into a party that can again be trusted,"" he said. According to BBC predictions the Conservatives won 44 percent of the national vote in the local elections versus 25 percent for the Liberal Democrats and just 24 percent for Labour -- its worst share since comparable records began in 1973. ""People are sending a clear and strong message. There's a lot of dissatisfaction. If we deal with it we can turn things around, if we don't we'll go down,"" Labour lawmaker Geraldine Smith told Reuters. With all the results counted from local councils in England and Wales, Labour had lost 331 councilors and the Conservatives had gained 252. Analysts said anything more than 200 losses for Labour would be a very bad result. ""It's clear to me that this has been a disappointing night, indeed a bad night for Labour,"" Brown told reporters. ""My job is to listen and to lead and that is what I will do."" BROWN EYES RELAUNCH Despite the upset, most Labour lawmakers said the party would be foolish to start casting around for a new leader and Brown was preparing a fight back with plans to unveil a new legislative program, possibly as early as next week. The Treasury will also be under pressure to come up with new measures to restore Labour's credibility on the economy -- hard won over the past 10 years when Brown was finance minister but squandered in recent months after a mistake over tax rates. But the gloomy economic news continued to roll in. British house prices suffered their biggest annual fall in 15 years in April, according to Britain's largest mortgage lender, HBOS Plc. ""If the economic crisis continues through 2010, Brown's dead in the water,"" MORI pollster Robert Worcester told Reuters. The Conservatives, the once dominant party of Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill, were in buoyant mood after more than a decade in the political wilderness. They scored victories in the north of England where they have struggled and in Labour heartlands in Wales. Labour lost Reading council, its last remaining stronghold in the wealthy southeast of England. ""I think this is a very big moment for the Conservative Party, but I don't want anyone to think that we would deserve to win an election just on the back of a failing government,"" said Conservative leader David Cameron."

en.15.65.123.2008.5.5,Hezbollah training Iraqis in Iran: report,"WASHINGTON, Mon May 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah is providing training in Iran for Iraqi militants, according to interrogation reports cited by US officials, the New York Times reported on Monday. The officials said the information came from four members of Shia militias who were captured last year in Iraq and questioned separately, according to the newspaper. The information was given to Iraq's government before an Iraqi delegation went to Tehran last week to present evidence of Iran's backing of Shia militias in Iraq, the Times said. It added that it was unclear if the Iraqis had in fact put the evidence forward to Iran. An Iraqi government spokesman said on Sunday after the delegation's return that Iranian officials had denied any interference in Iraq. Washington accuses Iran of funding, arming and training Shia militias to attack US-led troops and Iraqi government forces, despite its public commitment to stabilizing Iraq. Tehran blames the violence on the presence of US forces. The Times quoted the officials as saying it appeared that Iran, possibly to be less obtrusive, was bringing small groups of Shia militants into the country. There were then taught how to train others back in Iraq in techniques for firing rockets, fighting as snipers and building explosively formed penetrators -- a lethal kind of roadside bomb made of Iranian components. The officials said the training was being conducted at several camps near Tehran overseen by the Quds force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Command, with instruction from Hezbollah militants. The Iraqi government said on Monday that Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki had ordered the formation of a committee to compile evidence of Iranian interference in Iraq that would then be presented to Tehran. The Iraqis have said they do not want their territory to become the site of a proxy war between the United States and Iran, which are at odds over Tehran's nuclear ambitions"

South Korea has confirmed 24 cases of the deadly H5N1 strain in poultry in about a month. It has killed more than 5 million chickens and ducks but that has not stopped the virus from spreading at its fastest rate since the country reported its first case in 2003. The four birds were among 57 chickens, ducks and turkeys raised in pens at the district office in the eastern part of Seoul. The ministry said it would take about a day to confirm if the dead birds had contracted the H5N1 strain. The city had culled all the birds at the site and was limiting access to a nearby zoo and livestock market, the ministry said. Most of the outbreaks have been concentrated in the southwest of the country. South Korea had to kill 5.29 million birds during the first outbreak between late 2003 and early 2004. The second outbreak in 2006-2007 saw about half that number culled. On Monday, North Korea said it was stepping up measures to prevent the outbreak from being carried over its borders by migratory flocks. The last known bird flu outbreak in impoverished North Korea was in 2005"

The report bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its rate-cutting cycle, which enhances the appeal of the dollar. It also backed a growing view that the US economic slowdown may not be as deep as some originally thought. ""It shows that the argument about whether the US is in deep recession or just a slowdown is being resolved in favor of the dollar bulls,"" said Boris Schlossberg, senior currency strategist, at DailyFX.com in New York. The Labor Department said the US economy shed just 20,000 jobs last month. Markets were expecting job losses of 80,000, according to a Reuters poll. The euro fell against the dollar to $1.5362, the lowest since March 24, from $1.5479 before the data's release. It last traded at $1.5394, down 0.5 percent on the day. Against the yen, the dollar rose to 105.69, a two-month high, from 104.60. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose to two-month peaks at 73.698 and last traded at 73.544. The dollar also rose to a nine-week high versus the Swiss franc to 1.0596, before trading back down to 1.0574 francs. ""The dollar had been strong going in, and this is all very positive for it.

en.15.65.215.2008.5.4,Myanmar cyclone kills 350,"YANGON, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A cyclone killed more than 350 people in military-ruled Myanmar, ripping through Yangon and the Irrawaddy delta where it flattened at least two towns, officials and state media said on Sunday. The death toll is likely to climb as the authorities manage to contact outlying islands and villages that felt the full force of Cyclone Nagris, a Category 3 storm packing winds of 120 miles per hour when it hit early on Saturday. State television, which was still off air in Yangon more than 36 hours after Nagris slammed into the city of 5 million, reported 20,000 homes destroyed on one island alone, a government official in the remote capital, Naypyidaw, said. The island, Haingyi, is around 200 km southwest of Yangon on the western fringes of the Irrawaddy delta. Nagris, which had been gathering steam in the Bay of Bengal for several days, devastated the former Burma's leafy main city, littering the streets with overturned cars, fallen trees and debris from battered buildings. ""Utter war zone,"" one diplomat said in an email to Reuters in Bangkok. ""Trees across all streets. Utility poles down. Hospitals devastated. Clean water scarce."" Earlier, state media said 19 people had been killed in Yangon and 222 in the delta, where weather forecasters had predicted a storm surge of as much as 12 feet Official newspapers said only one in four buildings were left standing in Laputta and Kyaik Lat, two towns deep in the rice-producing region. There were no details of casualties. In Yangon, many roofs were ripped off even sturdy buildings, suggesting damage would be severe in the shanty towns that lie on its outskirts. Foreign aid workers, their movements restricted by the ruling military junta, struggled to reach many impoverished areas to assess the impact. ""I have never seen anything like it,"" one retired government worker told Reuters. ""It reminded me of when Hurricane Katrina hit the United States."" FOOD PRICES DOUBLE Although the sun shone on Sunday, the former capital was without power and water, and food prices had doubled overnight, with many storeholders unsure of when they would be able to replenish stocks. Most shops had sold out of candles. An Electricity Board official said it was impossible to know when the power supply -- hit-and-miss at the best of times in one of Asia's poorest countries -- would be restored. ""We still have to clear the mess,"" the official, who did not want to be named, said. United Nations disaster experts said it would be days before the full extent of the damage was known in a country ruled since 1962 by secretive and ruthless military regimes. Bunkered down in Naypyidaw, 240 miles to the north, the junta's top brass will almost certainly have avoided the worst of the storm. The regime declared a disaster in five states and government television carried footage of soldiers clearing trees from roads and Prime Minister Thein Sein, a lieutenant-general, meeting people sheltering in a Buddhist pagoda. ""DIRECT HIT"" As soldiers and police tried to clear streets and find victims beneath the rubble of fallen buildings, relief experts scrambled in neighboring Thailand in case the junta -- normally deeply distrustful of the outside world -- asked for help. ""It was a direct hit on a major city,"" said Terje Skavdal, regional head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). ""The government did warn people to stay inside and that might have had an impact, but the material damage is enormous,"" Skavdal said. The U.N. had yet to receive a response from the junta to its official offer of help, he added. It remains to be seen what impact the storm will have on a referendum on an army-drafted constitution scheduled for May 10. The charter is part of a ""roadmap to democracy"" meant to culminate in multiparty elections in 2010 and end nearly five decades of military rule.

en.15.65.423.2008.5.1,"U.S. jobs growth has ""ground to a halt""","Wed Apr 30, NEW YORK (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Jobs growth has ""ground to a halt"" and employment will remain weak for several months said the chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers on Wednesday, after the release of its joint private sector jobs report with ADP. While the downturn in manufacturing and construction employment showed little sign of abating, growth in service sector employment was offsetting that, though it was hardly robust, Joel Prakken told Reuters. A private report, jointly developed by ADP Employer Services and Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, earlier on Wednesday showed U.S. private-sector employers unexpectedly added 10,000 jobs in April. The result was much better than economists' median expectation for a drop of 60,000 jobs in April, according to a Reuters poll, but hardly a sign of a strong job market. ""We will probably see several more months of numbers like this before you can see ... more impressive gains,"" Prakken said. ""I think it is pretty clear that employment has ground to a halt and that the contractions in both manufacturing and construction employment are still ongoing and little sign really of any abatement in that contraction."" The April ADP report showed employment in the service-providing sector of the economy grew by 64,000. Manufacturing employment fell by 26,000 in April and marked the 20th consecutive monthly decline. Construction employment fell by 28,000. This is the 17th consecutive monthly decline. The ADP release comes ahead of Friday's monthly jobs report by the government. Analysts expect that to show a fall of 80,000 in April non-farm payrolls. In March the private sector added a downwardly revised 3,000 jobs, according to ADP. The March figure was originally reported as an increase of 8,000."
en.15.65.480.2008.5.6,Suicide bomber kills two in northwest Pakistan,"Peshawar, Pakistan, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suspected suicide bomber blew himself near a police checkpost in the northwestern Pakistani town of Bannu on Tuesday, killing two civilians and wounding five people including a soldier, police said. Pakistan saw a wave of suicide bomb attacks after an army assault on a radical mosque in the capital last July, but there has been a lull since the formation of new government in March that has called for talks to end the violence. Tuesday's attack, in which a bomber traveling in an auto-rickshaw taxi blew himself up as it stopped near the police post in the town in North West Frontier Province (NWFP), was the second since then. ""Two civilians were killed. One was sitting in the rickshaw while other was a passer-by,"" said a military official. The new government, led by the party of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, has begun talks with elders of ethnic Pashtun tribes along the Afghan border with whom militants have taken refuge. The militants announced a ceasefire last month but later said they were rejecting negotiations mediated by the elders after the government refused to withdraw troops from their stronghold areas. Also on Tuesday, suspected militants shot dead two policemen outside a bank in the Swat Valley, also in NWFP, in the second killing in two days in the region where the army has been battling militants since last year. The valley was a main tourist destination until last year when militants rallied to a radical cleric trying to impose Taliban-style rule, and began attacking police. The army launched an offensive in the valley in November and hundreds of people have been killed since then"
en.15.65.280.2008.5.3,Pakistan stays execution of Indian,"Islamabad, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistani government has deferred the execution of an Indian man condemned to death for spying and carrying out bombings in 1990, the Foreign Ministry said on Saturday. Last week, the family of Sarabjit Singh visited Pakistan to campaign for his pardon. Besides meeting officials and human rights activists, they saw Singh for the first time in 18 years in a prison in eastern city of Lahore. President Pervez Musharraf rejected his mercy plea in March, but deferred his execution by hanging until April 30 after a request from the Indian government. ""The implementation on the orders of Sarabjit's hanging has been stopped temporarily. It's not clemency or anything else,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Sadiq told Reuters. He said the government would make a decision on the issue after consulting various ministries. ""There's no timeframe. Now, the government will start a consultation process and then submit its decision to the president,"" Sadiq said. Singh was sentenced to death in 1991 for spying and carrying out bomb blasts that killed 14 people, but his family said he was innocent and had crossed the border into Pakistan accidentally in 1990 while he was drunk. Pakistani officials said Singh was arrested while trying to slip back into India after the bomb blasts. Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan have fought three wars since the partition of British-ruled India in 1947. They began a peace process in 2004. Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee is due to visit Pakistan later this month for a review of the four-year-old process. But despite better relations, the neighbors remain deeply suspicious of each other. In March, Pakistan freed an Indian man who had spent 35 years on death row in a Pakistani jail on spying charges. A Pakistani national, who went to India to watch a cricket match in 2005, was arrested and died in an Indian prison in February this year. Pakistan has asked India to explain the death of the man, whose family said had lost his passport, after being detained and tortured in prison."

The electricity supply -- hit-and-miss at the best of times in one of Asia's poorest countries -- failed after Cyclone Nargis, packing winds of up to 120 mph, first started to lash the former capital on Friday evening. There were no reports of deaths, although meteorological officials in the former Burma said the cyclone could trigger a storm surge of up to 12 feet in coastal areas. State-run MRTV and Yangon City Radio were off the air, as were the normally shaky Internet services. Buses and trains were not operating due to extensive flooding in residential areas of the city, which sits on the floodplains of the mighty Irrawaddy river. An official at Yangon International Airport said all incoming flights had been diverted to the second city of Mandalay, in the middle of the southeast Asian nation, and all departures from Yangon had been cancelled. Weather officials said Nargis was expected to keep moving northeast from Yangon and cross into northern Thailand in the next 24 hours. The damage appeared so extensive that it could be several days before power, telecommunication and transport services are up and running, possibly affecting preparations for a referendum on a new constitution scheduled for May 10."

""The KAFCO deal is destroying the country,"" Saifuzzaman Chowdhury, president of Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry, alleged at a press conference at the CCCI office. ""On the one hand, the company is being provided huge quantity of gas at a nominal price, while on the other, other factories and industries are about to close their operations for want of gas."" Chittagong was being neglected in different ways though the city played an important role in commerce and industry, Chowdhury said. He termed a remark of the chief adviser's special assistant M Tamim unfortunate. Tamim who oversees the power, energy and mineral resources ministry said Monday that the government would go slow in providing gas connections for new industries in Chittagong. Chowdhury said: ""We understand that the supply of gas is not adequate, but we cannot accept that the door is closed forever."" ""We will hold talks with the chief adviser on that,"" he said. The chamber leader suggested a rationing system for gas supply, if necessary. To overcome the crisis he asked the government to take initiative to excavate new gas fields. The chamber leader asked the government to import fertiliser. ""But do not create any disruption in the investment in the industries. Over 100 factories have halted production due to the gas crisis,"" he said. ""If investment is hampered, there will be no gain in reducing the prices of rice. If employment is not created purchasing power will not increase,"" Chowdhury said. The CCCI proposed that the government form a Chittagong Development Coordination Committee that would be effective for two years. It also recommended making the Chittagong City Corporation mayor chairman of the committee, and the CCCI president the co-chairman. ""If the committee works sincerely Chittagong will not be left neglected anymore and it will be turned into an effective commercial city,"" Chowdhury said. bdnews24."
en.15.65.473.2008.4.30,Palestinian factions agree to truce with Israel: MENA,"CAIRO, Wed Apr 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian factions meeting in Cairo for talks with Egyptian security officials have agreed to an Egyptian proposal for a truce with Israel starting in the Gaza Strip, state news agency MENA said on Wednesday. ""All the Palestinian factions have agreed to the Egyptian proposal on a truce with Israel,"" MENA said, citing an unnamed high-level Egyptian official. The official said the Egyptian proposal included a ""comprehensive, reciprocal and simultaneous truce, implemented in a graduated framework starting in the Gaza Strip and then subsequently moving to the West Bank,"" MENA added. ""This proposal is a phase of a broader plan that aims at providing an appropriate atmosphere before lifting the blockade and ending the state of Palestinian division,"" it said. Egypt invited 12 Palestinian groups for talks to form a consensus on a proposal for a six-month ceasefire, floated by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas last week. Although it wants Palestinians to stop firing missiles across the border, Israel has dismissed the offer as a Hamas ploy to gain time to prepare for more fighting. ""We are in favor of the truce, on the condition that it be balanced, reciprocal, equal and comprehensive, to include Gaza and the West Bank as well,"" Talal Nagy of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command told reporters on Wednesday. ""We support the truce on that basis that it be reciprocal, simultaneous and start in Gaza and extend to include the West Bank as soon as possible, but this does not mean we will end the resistance to the Israeli occupation,"" added Ghazi Hussein of the small group Saiqa. The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said on Tuesday it had approved a truce with Israel starting in the Gaza Strip, but reserved the right to respond to Israeli attacks in the West Bank. A truce between Israel and the Palestinians in Gaza would take some pressure off Egypt, a key regional mediator. Egypt does not want to be viewed as aiding the blockade of Gaza or to have Palestinian militants storm the Egyptian border with the coastal strip, as Hamas did earlier this year, allowing hundreds of thousands of Gazans to cross into Sinai. Israel pulled troops and settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 but still controls its borders and has tightened its restrictions since Hamas seized control there last year"
en.15.65.436.2008.5.4,Cyclone Nargis turns Myanmar city into `war zone',"YANGON, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's military government declared disaster areas in five states on Sunday after a Category 3 cyclone tore through the Irrawaddy delta region, killing at least four people in Yangon, state newspapers said. Packing winds of 190 km (120 miles) per hour when it hit on Saturday morning, Cyclone Nargis devastated the former Burma's leafy main city, littering the streets with debris from fallen trees and battered buildings. ""Utter war zone,"" one Yangon-based diplomat said in an email to Reuters in Bangkok. ""Trees across all streets. Utility poles down. Hospitals devastated. Clean water scarce."" Many roofs were ripped off even sturdy buildings, suggesting damage would be severe in the shanty towns that sit on the outskirts of the sprawling river-delta city of 5 million people. ""I have never seen anything like it,"" one retired government worker told Reuters. ""It reminded me of when Hurricane Katrina hit the United States."" Although the sun was shining by Sunday morning, the former capital was without power and water. An Electricity Board official said it was impossible to know when services -- hit-and-miss at the best of times in one of Asia's poorest countries -- would be restored. ""It is very hard to say when we can resume supply. We still have to clear the mess,"" the official, who did not want to be named, said. United Nations disaster experts said it would be days before the extent of the damage was known in a country ruled since 1962 by secretive and ruthless military regimes. Bunkered down in Naypyidaw, a new capital 240 miles to the north of Yangon, the ruling generals will almost certainly have avoided the worst of the storm. ""There does not seem to be a high number of casualties but for sure there is a lot of damage to property and infrastructure,"" Therje Skavdal, regional head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), said. ""It's early and it will take a few days before we get an overview of the damage,"" he told Reuters in Bangkok. Another United Nations official said a formal offer of assistance had been made although the junta was yet to respond. DEATH TOLL SEEN RISING Outside Yangon, the damage appears to have been severe. More than half of buildings had been damaged or collapsed in some towns in the Irrawaddy delta, where the massive cyclone landed on Friday night having gathered steam in the tropical waters of the Bay of Bengal, official newspapers said. The death toll -- so far just four people in Yangon -- is expected to climb as authorities slowly make contact with outlying towns and villages along the coast, where weather forecasters had predicted a storm surge of up to 12 feet (3.5 m). Official media said four vessels sank in Yangon harbor. It remains to be seen what impact the storm will have on a referendum on an army-drafted constitution scheduled for May 10. The charter is part of a ""roadmap to democracy"" meant to culminate in multiparty elections in 2010 and end nearly five decades of military rule. Critics say it gives the army too much control. An official at Yangon International Airport said all incoming flights had been diverted to the second city of Mandalay, in the middle of the southeast Asian nation, and all departures from Yangon had been cancelled. Thai Airways in Bangkok said flights would not resume before Monday. Nargis is now moving northeast into northern Thailand, where it has already caused heavy rain and triggered storm warnings"

DCs of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Bhola, Noakhali, Laxmipur and Bagerhat were asked to take cautionary preparations to face any emergency situation, food and disaster management secretary Molla Waheeduzzaman said after a meeting of senior government officials and meteorologists. The government also asked the Red Crescent Society to stay alert against the cyclone and to protect property of the people. Meteorologists said Nargis might make a landfall in Myanmar. Related agencies and the offices of deputy commissioners opened control rooms to watch the cyclone round the clock. The weather office in Bangladesh Thursday issued local warning signal 4 for Cox's Bazar and Chittagong and distant warning signal 2 for Mongla port. Arjumand Habib, director of the Met office, told bdnews24.com that the cyclone was likely to cut its path through Myanmar coasts. Under the peripheral influence of the storm, the low-lying areas of the coastal districts of Cox's Bazar, Chittagong, Noakhali, Laxmipur, Bhola and their offshore islands and chars are likely to be inundated by storm surges as high as 5 feet above the normal astronomical tide. bdnews24"
en.15.65.42.2008.5.3,Walmart.com using Wii Fit to boost Mom`s Day sales,"New York, May 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Forget the flowers and candy -- Nintendo Co Ltd's highly anticipated ""Wii Fit"" video game will debut in the US later this month, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's online division is trying to persuade shoppers to order the game as ""a perfect gift"" for Mother's Day. This weekend, the Walmart.com homepage will be dominated by the Wii Fit -- a physical exercise program that uses a pressure-sensing board as a controller -- including a link to order the product now, ahead of its May 19 U.S. launch. Through May 11, shoppers who ""pre-order"" the $89.74 game, or pay in advance to guarantee delivery when the game launches, will also get a $10 online gift card to use for a future order at Walmart.com. ""Initial response is extremely strong, and we're feeling really good about Nintendo Wii Fit dominating the home page,"" said Kelly Thompson, Walmart.com's chief merchant, of early shopper demand for the game. ""... We really like the angle of marketing it to Mom."" The move comes as retailers look for creative ways to entice shoppers to keep spending amid the economic downturn. Many U.S. consumers are shunning discretionary purchases as more of their budgets go toward rising food and fuel costs, and they have run out of access to easy credit to fund their shopping sprees. Retailers now see holidays, like Mother's Day on May 11, as potential bright spots when cash-strapped shoppers may be persuaded to spend some of their limited cash. According to a National Retail Federation Mother's Day survey, consumers, on average, intend to spend $138.63 on the holiday -- down from $139.14 last year. STRONG SALES GROWTH But the survey also found that consumers will shell out $1.2 billion this Mother's Day on consumer electronics like digital cameras, digital photo frames and video cameras. In addition, while U.S. consumers have pulled back on many discretionary purchases, video game hardware and software continue to post strong sales growth. U.S. sales of video game hardware and software rose 57 percent in March from a year earlier, according to market research firm NPD. Sales of gaming hardware, software and accessories hit $1.7 billion in March, led by Nintendo's Wii console, which posted its biggest nonholiday month ever. Wii Fit, to be played using the Wii console, has already has sold more than a million units in Japan. Walmart.com is seeing a trend toward consumers buying more tech-related gifts, like digital photo frames or cameras, for mothers, Thompson said. With Wii Fit, Nintendo is trying to appeal to new video game users, like women and older consumers. ""You'll see our marketing programs really reach out to both genders and a range of ages,"" said Cammie Dunaway, executive vice president of sales and marketing for Nintendo's U.S. operations, in an interview with Reuters in February. Dunaway said such gamers will still be drawn to the novelty and sophistication of Wii Fit and its bathroom scale-sized controller, which uses sensors to detect subtle shifts in a person's stance. Thompson said Walmart.com has worked with Nintendo on the Wii Fit promotion and ensuring it has a strong inventory position to fill the pre-orders. There also will be a link on the site to buy the Wii console, as well as other games and accessories. Thompson said consumers can give the $10 gift card to mothers on Mother's Day since the Wii Fit will not ship until after the May 11th holiday."

The High Commissioner had talks on the current state of the country and upcoming national polls with the leaders in separate meetings. ""This is a farewell call. We discussed many things. The current state, concerns and hopes and the forthcoming elections,"" Choudhury told bdnews24.com after a meeting with Zillur Rahman at his Gulshan home. Rahman told reporters that he had discussed the Awami League's demand for the release of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina with Choudhury. ""Our first demand is the release of Sheikh Hasina and the second is an end to the state of emergency, the third is an election date and the fourth is price control,"" Rahman said. ""We raised the demands for the government through the high commissioner and he assured us that he would try to help us in this regard,"" he said. Rahman however ducked a question on how the British high commissioner would help them in fulfilling the demands. After a one-hour meeting with Delwar in his NAM apartment, the UK envoy told reporters that he had discussed the national polls, dialogue and human rights situation with the BNP leader. The High Commissioner said the UK wanted to see a free and peaceful election in Bangladesh with all political parties participating in it. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah, joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy and acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed were present. Choudhury said he had visited the BNP leader to ""say goodbye"". They had talks on various issues but the election dominated the talks, he said. The high commissioner said he believed a free, fair and peaceful election would be held in Bangladesh by December with the participation of all political parties. On withdrawal of the state of emergency, Choudhury said the UK hoped the emergency would be lifted before the polls. But the state of emergency has at least to be relaxed if it cannot be lifted completely, he said. Delwar told reporters that he had talked about the cases against 'political prisoners' with the British envoy. ""We told the High Commissioner that the dialogue would have been meaningful if two leaders had been freed to join dialogue. People of the country would not accept the polls except them. Election fixing may create an unstable situation in the country,"" he said. Choudhury will leave Dhaka in the third week of May. bdnews24.com"

en.15.119.169.2009.4.13,Thai forces crack down on protesters,"By Martin Petty BANGKOK, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Thai army cracked down on anti-government protesters on Monday, firing warning shots at a major junction in the capital at demonstrators who responded by hurling petrol bombs, witnesses said. At Din Daeng intersection, Bangkok's biggest, troops repeatedly charged small groups of protesters to clear a major road leading out of the city as Thailand began a three-day New Year's holiday on Monday. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva declared a state of emergency in Bangkok on Sunday after red-shirted supporters of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra forced the cancellation of an Asian summit in the southern beach resort of Pattaya. A Buddhist monk with a megaphone stood in the intersection pleading for calm and telling the soldiers: ""Don't shoot, think about your country."" Fires from petrol bombs blazed in the streets, and ambulances and firetrucks were at the scene. Police on motorbikes were shuttling between troops and demonstrators to mediate. Troops fired repeatedly into the air as they charged the demonstrators, a Reuters reporter said. Army spokesman Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd said troops in vehicles with loudspeakers had asked the ""red shirts"" to lift a blockade they have maintained for several days at the junction, but they did not respond. By around 7:30 a.m. (0030 GMT), the action had calmed down and the two sides were in tense standoff, but water cannon were being rolled up to the scene, the Reuters reporter said. More than 10 soldiers had been wounded, mostly from being hit by buses driven by the protesters, he said. An official at the government emergency medical service told Reuters they had treated 76 people. A number of protesters had been arrested, Sansern said. One ""red shirt"" on a motorcycle and holding a wooden stake said defiantly: ""We won't go. We're doing this for the people."" HUMILIATED AT SUMMIT Some 20,000 ""red shirts"" remained at Government House, about 4 kms (2.5 miles) from the junction, where they have been demonstrating for nearly three weeks demanding Abhisit resigns. Several stopped a Reuters reporter there, telling him: ""They're killing our people,"" referring to false rumors that the firings at the Din Daeng junction had been deadly. Thaksin's supporters say Abhisit only became premier last December because of parliamentary defections the army engineered. They want new elections, which they would be well placed to win. Abhisit had threatened on Sunday to take tough action against protesters, who then began gathering in force in Bangkok. He had been humiliated before his Asian peers when Thaksin supporters bowled over riot troops at the summit in Pattaya and smashed their way into meeting venue. Some leaders had to flee by helicopter. The canceled Asian summit and now the heightened tensions in the capital have undermined confidence in the government and dealt another blow to the economy, still reeling from political chaos last year and the global financial crisis, analysts said. Troops fired into the air on Sunday when anti-government protesters stormed the interior ministry. The crowds mobbed the prime minister's car and beat it with clubs as he drove away from the ministry. Thaksin, who has been making nightly phone calls to his supporters from exile, said on Sunday it was now the ""golden time"" to rise up against the government. He repeated his call for a ""people's revolution"" and said he was ready to move back to Thailand to lead a people's uprising if there was a coup. Thailand has seen 18 coups since 1932 and another one is certainly a possibility if there is blood in the streets. The chaos in the capital is bound to further hit the tourism sector, one of Thailand's biggest foreign exchange earners, and several countries have already warned against traveling to the king"
en.15.119.68.2009.4.10,Arabia and the knowledge gap,"By Bernd Debusmann Washington, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Think big. Think global. Spare no expense. That could be the motto for an ambitious effort by the United Arab Emirates to close the knowledge gap with the West and eventually restore Arab learning to its former glory. Headlines from Dubai, the second-largest and most flamboyant of the seven emirates that make up the country, have been dominated by the bursting of a spectacular property bubble and an exodus of foreigners who lost their jobs as the global recession slowed down the economy. One thing that is not slowing an education drive without parallel in the Arab world. ""Our commitment to excellence in education remains undiminished despite the economic crisis,"" the UAE minister of higher education and scientific research, Sheikh Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan told a meeting this month that brought together some 1,000 students from 120 countries to discuss subjects that ranged from educating deaf students to improving global financial stability by better regulation. The 1,000-student get-together in Dubai, more famous for over-the-top opulence than as an educational center, is known as Education Without Borders and takes place every two years, as does an event dubbed Festival of Thinkers that brings together Nobel Prize Winners and well-known public intellectuals with students from the UAE and neighboring countries. The next one is scheduled for November. Around the world, education is a tempting target for budget cutters in times of financial distress. But the UAE education budget has been increased by 12 percent this year and now takes up almost a quarter of overall spending. Expensive? Yes. But, as one speaker at a panel discussion put it: ""If you think education is expensive, try ignorance."" ""What's been happening here,"" said Jamil Mroue, a Lebanese newspaper publisher who now makes his home in Abu Dhabi, ""is that the Emirates have turned into an incubator for new ideas and fresh thinking. The ancient seats of Arab learning - Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad - have nothing new to contribute."" It is somewhat ironic that a country as young as the UAE - at 37 years old, a mere toddler of a place - is seen as an example for the heavyweights of Arab history to follow. Few members of the founding generation had any formal schooling. In 1972, when Ras al Khaimah joined six other emirates to complete the United Arab Emirates, the new country had just 45 university graduates, five of whom were women. WOMEN OUTNUMBER MEN Now the UAE has 60 colleges and universities and female students comfortably outnumber men. At the largest institution of higher learning, for example, the Higher Colleges of Technology, the ratio of women to men is 10,000 to 6,000. Three out of five students in the public education system - which is free for Emiratis - are women, a remarkable achievement in a Muslim country. Gender equality is enshrined in the constitution and while health care and education attract a considerable share of educated women, the UAE air force admitted four female pilots last year. Women also serve in the police and make up about a fifth of the diplomatic corps. So, how close is the UAE to the aim announced two years ago by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, UAE prime minister and ruler of Dubai, ""to build a knowledge-based society throughout the region and enhance the standing of scholars and intellectuals in the Arab world."" Still a way to go. At the time, Sheikh Mohammed pledged $10 billion to the project and announced plans to re-establish the Arab House of Wisdom which flourished in Baghdad in the Arab World's golden age, from 800 to 1,500 AD, and had no rivals in the study of philosophy and science. Discoveries ranged from algebra to optics. Arabic was the language of international scholarship. The knowledge gap that is now being narrowed is between Arabs and the West, where the Arabs' role in the development of modern science is rarely recognized and largely forgotten. And how large is the gap? Researchers from the UAE and the United Nations Development Program are working on an Arab Knowledge Report 2009 which should show how far the Arab world has advanced since a devastating 2002 UNDP assessment written not by Western scholars but by Arab experts. They portrayed the Arab region as living in isolation from the world of ideas and lagging behind the rest of the world on virtually everything, from education to respect for human rights and the status of women. Only six (including the UAE) of the 22 Arab countries were seen as having achieved ""high human development."" There's a reason for the UAE beyond trying to help wake the Arab world from decades of decline and slumber, and it's entirely pragmatic: demographics. Fewer than 20 percent of the 4.5 million population are native Emiratis and the economy is almost entirely run by foreigners. According to the official United Emirates Yearbook, expatriates currently hold 99 percent of jobs in the private sector and 91 percent of positions in the government. ""Emiratisation"" of the work force has been a key plank of government policies but progress has been slow, partly because employers have been reluctant to hire Emiratis. Confidence in the education system should help diminish that reluctance. But the 21st century House of Wisdom seems a distant g"

Sakhawat said some 52 out of 1,538 candidates were yet to submit the statement of their election expenses. On whether the statements filed were right, the commissioner said they would have the statements examined by accountants. ""If necessary we will run an audit,"" he said. The commissioner said Awami League and Jamaat-e-Islami had submitted their detailed election expenses. But BNP and Bangladesh Workers Party, Bangladesh Jatiya Party (BJP), Muslim League and National People's Party did not. Of the 38 parties that ran the elections, six parties did not submit their election expenses. They were Bangladesh Samyabadi Dal, HM Ershad-led Jatiya Party, Bangladesh Torikat Federation, Gono Front, Bangladesh Islami Front and Freedom Party. Sakhawat said the commission was ready for elections to the Dhaka City Corporation. The elections were likely by the end of the year if the proposed law was passed in the second session of parliament, he said. The commission would sit with the registered political parties soon on the parliamentary elections, Upazila polls and the amended Representation of People Order passed in parliament, Sakhawat said. The discussions might take place prior to the budget session, he said. ""We are organising the discussions to bridge communication with the parties.""

The Congressional Oversight Panel, the body named by Congress to oversee the federal bailout, is working on a report examining instances of potentially inappropriate lending by banks that got taxpayer capital, according to the paper. ""The people who are subsidizing the activities of the banks through their tax dollars are the same people who are furnishing the high profits through consumer lending,"" Elizabeth Warren, chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel told the Journal in an interview. ""In a sense, we're asking taxpayers to pay twice,"" Warren told the paper. The US Treasury Department's $700 billion TARP was intended to provide lenders with more capital to spur lending and improve the economy. Since TARP was launched in October, banks bolstered by capital infusions have boosted charges on a wide range of routine transactions, hiked rates on credit cards and continued making loans criticized as predatory by consumer advocates, the Journal"
en.15.119.466.2009.4.12,"Somali pirates, US captive drift toward shore","MOGADISHU, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A lifeboat used by Somali pirates holding a US merchant marine captain captive drifted toward Somalia's lawless coast on Sunday, with US warships tracking it to keep the pirates from escaping to shore. The lifeboat that was out of fuel had drifted to within 20 miles (32 km) of the Somali coast by late on Saturday, and US military officials said they feared that if it reached the shore, the pirates might try to escape with their hostage on land. The US-flagged Maersk Alabama container ship from which Capt. Richard Phillips was taken last week arrived safely in the Kenyan port of Mombasa on Saturday, as a Somali mediator headed to sea to try to secure his release. ""The captain is a hero,"" one crew member shouted from the 17,000-ton Maersk Alabama container ship as it docked. ""He saved our lives by giving himself up."" The ship was attacked by gunmen far out in the Indian Ocean on Wednesday but its 20 American crew apparently fought off the hijackers and regained control of the ship. Relatives said Phillips volunteered to join the pirates in their lifeboat in exchange for the safety of his ship and its crew. The four pirates holding him want $2 million ransom for him and a guarantee of safe passage. Three U.S. warships including the destroyer USS Bainbridge were in the area around the lifeboat. Military officials said the pirates fired on a small US craft that approached them from the Bainbridge on Saturday. No one was hurt by the volley and the craft withdrew. Somalia has suffered 18 years of chaotic civil war, and the international waters off the Horn of Africa have become some of the most dangerous in the world. HOSTAGES FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES Phillips is just one of about 270 hostages from around the world being held by pirates preying on the busy sea-lanes of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. The Maersk Alabama incident has captured world attention because Phillips is the first US citizen seized and his crew regained control of the ship. The standoff has forced US President Barack Obama to focus on a place most Americans would rather forget. A US intervention in Somalia in the early 1990s was a disaster, including the ""Black Hawk Down"" battle in 1993 that killed 18 US troops and inspired a book and a movie. A White House spokesman said Obama received multiple updates on the piracy situation on Saturday. John Reinhart, president and chief executive of Maersk Line Ltd, said the FBI was investigating the hijacking in Kenya. ""Because of the pirate attack, the FBI has informed us that this ship is a crime scene,"" he told reporters, adding that the crew will have to stay on board the vessel. It was still not clear how the crew retook control of their vessel, which was carrying thousands of tons of food aid for Somalia, Uganda and Kenya. Somali elders sent a mediator on Saturday in hopes of resolving the standoff between the US Navy and the pirates holding Phillips, a 53-year-old Vermont father of two. ""They are just looking to arrange safe passage for the pirates, no ransom,"" said Andrew Mwangura, coordinator of a regional group that monitors piracy. The mediator took to sea in a boat but it was unclear how he planned to reach the pirates. The gang holding Phillips remained defiant. ""We will defend ourselves if attacked,"" one told Reuters by satellite phone. Pirates are keeping about 17 captured vessels on Somalia's eastern coast, six of them taken in the last week alone"

The club are currently being coached by former player Alan Shearer who agreed to return as manager for the last eight matches of the season as Newcastle battle to avoid relegation from the Premier League. Kinnear has been recovering from triple heart bypass surgery in February. ""Joe had his tests on Monday and the doctors were pleased with him,"" Llambias told The Northern Echo newspaper.

Cagliari said one of their players was hit in the tunnel after their 2-1 defeat at Fiorentina, while the derby between AS Roma and Lazio was marred by incidents inside and outside the stadium. ""We have a player, (Diego) Lopez, who is hurt so he must have taken a punch from someone,"" Cagliari boss Massimiliano Allegri was quoted as saying by the ANSA news agency. ""There was a bit of commotion in the tunnel and it seems like there was an attack."" Three players were sent off in the second half of the Rome derby, which Lazio won 4-2, while Roma coach Luciano Spalletti and Lazio team manager Igli Tare were also red-carded because of a heated exchange at halftime. Spalletti, who was angry about the opening goal coming from a corner wrongly awarded to Lazio and a turned-down penalty shout, and Tare continued the row on television after the game. Police used tear gas to separate fans of the rival Roman teams while one supporter suffered minor injuries in a clash after the game, newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport reported on its website (www.gazzetta.it). There had been calls in the media for Serie A to be on its best behaviour as a mark of respect following the earthquake and the day started positively in this regard. A minute's silence was observed at the start of the games, with the receipts from some going to disaster funds, the players wore black armbands and there were messages of solidarity at the grounds. Several footballers and coaches said this week that it would have been better to have postponed this weekend's Serie A programme.

But 75-year-old Shigeo Tokuda sat on a movie set on Monday wearing just a silk kimono and loin cloth about to have sex on film with a woman who is younger than his daughter. Tokuda is Japan's oldest pornographic movie star and was shooting his latest film in which he portrayed a master of sex. The director said the films showed people that their sex lives did not have to end with old age, and in 16 years of making such movies Tokuda has acted up with women ranging from their 20s to as old as himself. ""I debuted at 59, and have played in more than 200 porno movies since then,"" he said, using his screen name, not his real one in an interview on the set. ""I wanted to challenge what ordinary people did not, so I decided to be a porno actor."" In Monday's film he used vibrators, whips and candle lights to show the master satisfying a 36-year-old actress. The film was not scripted. Tokuda turned to the pornographic industry late. He lived a typical Japanese office worker's life as a travel agent after graduating from one of Tokyo's elite colleges. The career sideline came about because he was unsatisfied with a lack of story lines in sex movies he'd seen, which led to a discussion with a film producer about whether he could do better. It took a couple of years of thinking about it but Tokuda eventually took his pants off for the camera. Since then, he has became a popular figure in porn movies for rent in Japan, with its rapidly aging population and long life expectancy. One in five Japanese is over 65 years old. ""Other old men think they can do it because he can. The elderly can feel secure and encouragement when they see his films,"" said Gaichi Kono, the director of Tokuda's latest film. Japan's elderly are rejecting the idea that growing old means slowing down, said Chineko Araki, a professor of social welfare from Den-en Chofu University. ""More than 50 percent of men over 65 are eager to have a sexual relationship with their partners,"" she said in an email interview. Tokuda's films will soon be offered to Japanese retirement homes, exports beckon and they may be shown on the Internet. Tokuda says his wife and daughter pretend not to know and his friends will never guess. ""But my job makes me keep alive,"" he says, adding he plans to keep going at least till he hits 80 years"
en.15.119.57.2009.4.10,Satyam annual revenue seen at $1.5-$1.7 bln: sources,"MUMBAI, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fraud-hit Satyam Computer Services Ltd's annual revenues appear to be about $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, three sources who have analysed data provided by the outsourcing firm to bidders said on Thursday. The number is sharply lower than the $2.14 billion the Indian company had reported for the fiscal year to March 2008, before the revelation of India's biggest corporate fraud. ""We have analysed the data and feel that this is the revenue level for the firm,"" said one source who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Satyam was plunged into crisis on January 7 when its founder quit as chairman, saying profits had been falsified for years, revenues overstated and more than $1 billion in cash and equivalents did not exist. A government-appointed board tasked with resucing the firm decided to sell a controlling stake in the firm, once ranked as India's fourth-largest outsourcer, and appointed Goldman Sachs and Indian investment bank Avendus to advise it. The sources said they were still assessing the profitability of Satyam ahead of finalising bids for a 51 percent stake. Bids will be submitted and opened on April 13, and Satyam has said a winner can be announced the same day. As well profit and revenue, bidders need to make an assessment of several uncertainties, including potential legal liabilities arising from lawsuits filed in the United States by shareholders. Satyam has not reported earnings since reporting July-September numbers in October as its accounts are in the process of being restated. Indian media have reported more than 40 clients of Satyam have left the firm since the revelation of the fraud, but Satyam has declined comment. Indian engineering and construction firm Larsen & Toubro, which has built up a 12 percent stake in Satyam, mid-sized outsourcer Tech Mahindra and private equity firm W.L.

en.15.119.37.2009.4.10,Moldovan president calls for election recount,"CHISINAU, April 10 (Reuters) - Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin called on Friday for a recount of an election after violent protests by protesters who say the vote was rigged. Opposition parties said the president's offer, on grounds that it would help restore calm, was meaningless and intended to distract attention from mass fraud on voters' lists. The parties have demanded a new election. Voronin, Europe's only ruling communist, asked the Constitutional Court to rule on a recount of Sunday's vote. The court is dominated by his supporters and very likely to agree. ""I, as chairman of the party which gained undoubted victory in the fair and democratic contest, approach the Constitutional Court for a clear decision on the need for a full recount of the votes cast in the parliamentary election,"" Voronin said. ""A full recount ... would be an important argument for the restoration of political stability, peace and mutual confidence in the Moldovan Republic,"" he said in the request, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. Thousands of demonstrators looted and set fire to the parliament and the president's offices in the capital Chisinau on Tuesday in the worst violence to sweep the city in decades. Voronin accused neighboring European Union member Romania of trying to stage a coup as part of a plan to annex Moldova, with which it shares ethnic and language ties. He expelled its ambassador and denied entry to a score of Romanian journalists. The Central Election Commission this week confirmed results showing Voronin's party winning nearly half the vote -- a ruling that implied there would be no recount as the opposition sought. The results gave the Communists just short of 50 percent of the vote and 60 seats in the 101-member assembly -- one short of the number needed to ensure victory for the party's candidate when the assembly elects the president. RECOUNT Eight of the nine court judges in the Constitutional Court were appointed under Voronin. Opponents said the vote recount proposal was an attempt to mask fraud on electoral lists. They say thousands of dead people and Moldovans who work abroad were included on the lists and had votes cast in their names. ""This is a trick to draw attention from fraud on the voter lists,"" said Serafim Urecheanu, leader of Our Moldova, one of three opposition parties to win seats in the election. He said the authorities were stopping opposition parties from checking the electoral lists although the Election Commission granted them access to the lists earlier in the week. After demonstrations 10,000-strong on Monday and Tuesday, only about 100 protesters stood outside the government building on Friday. Many held daffodils described as symbols of peace and spring. Dozens of riot police stood behind the building. ""No one told me to protest,"" said Vasile, a middle-aged teacher. ""I just came here because I felt so strongly about this. The nation was deceived."" Moldova's opposition parties have tried to distance themselves from Tuesday's violence and some opposition leaders have accused the authorities of being behind it. Voronin has been in power since 2001 and his second and last presidential term is about to end. He cannot seek a third consecutive term under constitutional limits. But he has made it clear he wants to stay close to power and become a ""Moldovan Deng Xiaoping,"" a reference to the late Chinese leader who continued to wield huge influence in China after stepping down from top official posts."
en.15.119.277.2009.4.9,Iran declares new progress in nuclear drive,"ISFAHAN, Iran, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran declared fresh progress in its nuclear program Thursday, inaugurating its first nuclear fuel production plant and announcing it had tested more advanced equipment for enriching uranium. The moves, announced a day after the United States and five other powers said they would invite Tehran for talks on in its nuclear program, are likely to revive Western concerns that the Islamic Republic aims to develop nuclear bombs under the cover of a civilian program. Tehran says it only aims to generate electricity so that it can export more of its oil. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad inaugurated the fuel manufacturing plant near Isfahan in central Iran, a development which one leading politician said meant the Islamic Republic had mastered all stages of nuclear fuel production. A manager at the fuel manufacturing plant near Isfahan in central Iran, Vajihollah Asadi, said it was ""100 percent"" Iranian and that it would produce fuel for Iran's Arak heavy water reactor. Gholamreza Aghazadeh, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, said Iran was now running 7,000 uranium enrichment centrifuges, and had obtained technology to produce more ""accurate centrifuges."" In February, Iran had said it was running 6,000 centrifuges. Ahmadinejad also said Thursday Iran has tested two new types of uranium enrichment centrifuges with a capacity ""a few times higher than the existing centrifuges"" currently in use. Western powers have demanded that Tehran halts sensitive enrichment activity, which can be used to in the manufacture of nuclear bombs as well as power generation. But the head of the Iranian parliament's national security and foreign policy commission, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, told reporters in Isfahan: ""Today Iran practically proved that its (nuclear) fuel cycle has been completed and naturally suspension of uranium enrichment cannot be discussed with Iran."" SEEKING SOLUTION The United States, Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain said Wednesday they would ask European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana to invite Tehran to a meeting to find ""a diplomatic solution to this critical issue."" It marked a policy reversal in Washington under new President Barack Obama, after his predecessor George W. Bush spearheaded a drive to isolate Iran over work the West suspects is aimed at making bombs. Tehran denies the charge. China, a veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council and a close energy and trade partner with Iran, said it welcomed signs of renewed engagement and urged Tehran and other powers to pursue contacts aimed at defusing the long-running row. Ahmadinejad said Iran was ready for talks with the West if those talks were based on ""justice and respect."" Foreign nuclear analysts believe Tehran has yet to prove it has mastered industrial-scale enrichment of uranium, the key to making fuel in large, usable quantities and the most technically difficult aspect of producing nuclear power."

Zardari signed the regulation late on Monday after the National Assembly unanimously passed a resolution recommending he approve it, the APP news agency reported. ""Reportedly, as a result of the said peace agreement, the law and order situation is improving in Swat,"" the assembly said in recommending that Zardari sign the regulation. Surging militant violence across Pakistan and the spread of Taliban influence through the northwest are reviving concerns about the stability of nuclear-armed Pakistan, an important U.S. ally vital to efforts to stabilise neighbouring Afghanistan. Authorities accepted an Islamist demand for sharia law in Swat in February to end more than a year of fighting but critics said appeasement would only embolden the militants. Swat was one of Pakistan's main tourist destinations until 2007 when militants infiltrated into the North West Frontier Province valley from strongholds on the Afghan border to support a radical cleric. Zardari, who has vowed to stand up to the spread of militancy, had faced pressure from conservatives and the main political party in the northwest, who said sharia law was the only way to bring peace to Swat. The United States and other Pakistanis say deals with the Taliban create safe havens for them and their al Qaeda allies. Some Pakistani Taliban fighters last week moved out of Swat, unopposed by the authorities, and into Buner district to the southeast. Buner residents formed a militia to try to resist the militants and 13 people, including eight Taliban, three policemen and two villagers, were killed in clashes. But the militants have prevailed and have begun imposing their rule in the mountain valley only 100 km from the capital, police and residents"

""In fact, it was a false case, no such incident had occurred at all. We didn't have any interaction or communication with Sheikh Helal,"" Md Mamatajuddin, manager of Reza Construction Limited, told a press conference in the capital on Sunday. ""Since the change in government, on April 7, I appealed to the home ministry to withdraw the case, explaining the real situation,"" he said. Sheikh Helal, cousin of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, was elected uncontested last month to Bagerhat-1 after Hasina vacated the seat, one of three she won in the Dec 29 parliamentary election. Mamatajuddin filed the case against Helal and a sub-contractor, Munshi Saiduzzaman, with Kafrul police on May 21, 2007. He accused Helal of using Saiduzzaman to extort Tk 1.2 crore from Reza Construction. The first information report of the case said that the firm had paid the money by cheques. Mamatajuddin said Sunday: ""The joint forces pushed our company to file a case against Sheikh Helal. They detained me and tortured physically and mentally."" ""I gave a statement and signed the first information report out of fear."" Asked about the delay in withdrawing the case, the construction firm's director SAS Sohel said it was due to legal processes and they ""did not face any political pressure to withdraw the case"". ""Had we been pressured then, we would not have taken four months to withdraw the case,"" Sohel said. Besides the Sheikh Helal case, the firm also filed three other cases against pro-BNP businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun during the caretaker period. ""We filed all the cases under the same circumstances. Measures will be taken about these cases later as well,"" Sahel said.

The 26-year-old was reported by the umpires over his quick and doosra deliveries following the hosts' win over Australia in the fourth one-dayer in Port Elizabeth on Monday. The doosra spins away from a right-handed batsman rather than into him as a conventional off-break delivery does. Botha, who was reported for chucking in 2006, will undergo an independent analysis of his action by the ICC's panel of human movement specialists. The process should be completed in five weeks. If Botha is found to have bowled with an illegal action, he will be suspended from bowling in international cricket.

en.15.119.387.2009.4.10,CIA says shuttering 'black sites',"By Randall Mikkelsen WASHINGTON, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The CIA will decommission the infamous ""black sites"" where terrorism suspects were interrogated with harsh techniques that included waterboarding, agency director Leon Panetta said on Thursday. Panetta said in a letter to agency employees that he had informed Congress of the CIA's detention policies following an order by President Barack Obama in January banning harsh interrogations and ordering that the secret detention sites be closed. He said the agency had also discontinued using contract employees to conduct interrogations, a concern of influential congressional members who called the practice an invitation to abuse. ""CIA no longer operates detention facilities or black sites and has proposed a plan to decommission the remaining sites,"" Panetta wrote. ""I have directed our Agency personnel to take charge of the decommissioning process and have further directed that the contracts for site security be promptly terminated."" A copy of the letter was obtained by Reuters. The now-empty ""black sites"" in unidentified countries were used to detain suspects who were captured in the ""war on terrorism"" launched by former President George W. Bush after the September 11 attacks. The three suspects that the CIA has acknowledged were subjected to waterboarding, a form of simulated drowning widely condemned as a form of torture, were subjected to the technique at such black sites. The suspects were accused September 11 plotter Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and al Qaeda suspects Abu Zubayhda and Abd al-Rahim al-Nishiri. Panetta said the CIA would continue to question suspects as necessary. But he said it would use ""a dialog style of questioning that is fully consistent with the interrogation approaches authorized and listed in the Army Field Manual,"" which bans harsh techniques. ""CIA officers do not tolerate, and will continue to promptly report, any inappropriate behavior or allegations of abuse. That holds true whether a suspect is in the custody of an American partner or a foreign liaison service,"" he said. Furthermore, he said, ""no CIA contractors will conduct interrogations.""

en.15.119.342.2009.4.16,Russia lifts security regime in Chechnya,"MOSCOW, Thu Apr 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia has lifted a tight security regime in Chechnya which has allowed it to enforce military-style restrictions there for the past decade, a Kremlin security body said on Thursday. ""This decision aims to create conditions to further normalise the situation in the region, to restore and develop its economic and social infrastructure,"" a spokesman for the National Anti-Terrorist Committee, which has responsibility for the region, said. Restrictions such as curfews, roadblocks, spot searches and arbitrary detention were imposed in Chechnya in 1999 when Russia sent troops to the region to end its short-lived independence, won in an earlier war with Moscow. Kremlin opponents say the special regime, which also includes restricted access for journalists, has fostered huge violations of human rights in the region. The decision to end it was taken by President Dmitry Medvedev, said the committee's spokesman. Over the past 10 years the pro-Moscow regional administration led by former rebel Ramzan Kadyrov has subdued large-scale rebel resistance. Kadyrov says Chechnya today is stable and the region has put behind it the violence that claimed tens of thousands of lives after war erupted in 1994. Kadyrov, who is backed by the Kremlin and the Russian mass media, has long wanted to ease both the restrictions and slacken Moscow's grip on the region. Russia has withdrawn most of its army units from Chechnya but tens of thousands of police from other Russian regions and scores of special service units still patrol there. Chechnya remains one of Russia's poorest regions, dependent on handouts from the federal bu"
en.15.119.120.2009.4.10,Hamburg recover from shock start to beat City,"HAMBURG, Germany, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hamburg SV recovered from a shocking start when they conceded a goal after just 35 seconds to beat Manchester City 3-1 in an action-packed UEFA Cup quarter-final, first leg on Thursday. Martin Jol's team, who are also chasing the Bundesliga title, were rocked when Stephen Ireland put the visitors ahead almost straight from the kickoff after a smart interchange with Robinho. The home side equalised when Joris Mathijsen powered in a header from a corner after nine minutes and took the lead in the 63rd with a Piotr Trochowksi penalty for handball by Micah Richards. Substitute Paolo Guerrero gave Hamburg a two-goal advantage to take into next Thursday's second leg in Manchester when he slammed in their third from close range in the 79th minute. ""We'd like to forget the first minute, but then after that we played well,"" said Jol. ""It was a big wake-up call, but we played well in the first half and had five or six great chances and we could have been three or four up by the second half,"" he told ITV Sport. Hamburg would have won by a far bigger margin if City goalkeeper Shay Given had not been in such outstanding form, but City will feel they have everything to play for with an away goal to their credit. ""In the end we did concede three but we showed tonight that we can cause them problems and it will be a big night at Eastlands in a week's time,"" City manager Mark Hughes told ITV. ""I said to the guys none of them should think the tie is over, because we can score goals in the return leg."" IRELAND SHOCK Ireland stunned Hamburg when he interchanged passes with Robinho and made a long run for the return ball which he slotted past the goalkeeper with a precise shot. That goal set the tone for an exhilarating first half in which Hamburg carried the game to City with a series of superb counter-attacking moves and a well deserved equaliser after nine minutes. Given had already made three excellent saves after some breathtaking Hamburg attacks, but although he got a hand to Mathijsen's powerful near-post header, he could not stop it flying into the back of the net. Hamburg went ahead just past the hour when Richards handled an acrobatic effort from Mathijsen and Trochowski slammed the penalty past Given. Trochowski then set up Hamburg's third for Guerrero, who swept the ball high into the City net from close range eight minutes after replacing Olic"
en.15.119.285.2009.4.16,India goes to polls,"VARANASI, India, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indians were voting in the first stage of a staggered general election on Thursday just as the economy is hit by a slowdown and with polls showing the main national parties may struggle to form a stable coalition. The ruling Congress party-led coalition appears to lead against an alliance headed by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but both may need the support of a host of smaller regional parties to win office. More than 140 million people can vote on Thursday in polls that cover some of India's poorest and most insurgency-ridden states. The government has deployed more than two million security personnel across India as Maoist rebels have stepped up attacks on forces and threatened voters. New Delhi said it was also on heightened alert for militant infiltrations from Pakistan. The outcome will be known on May 16 after five stages. India's elections are notoriously hard to predict and polls have been wrong in the past. Exit polls are banned for the election. ARRAY OF CASTES In Varanasi, the northern holy town known for its Hindu gurus, banners and bunting fluttered from rooftops. Many activists were seen moving around in cars and on motorbikes plastered with their party symbols and mugshots of their candidates. An array of castes, religions and ethnicities make up the 714 million people eligible voters in what is the world's largest democratic exercise. The centre-left Congress is wooing voters with populist measures such as food subsidies and farm loan waivers in a country were hundreds of millions live below the poverty line. The BJP accuses its main rival of poor governance and being weak on security, after a string of militant attacks last year culminated in a rampage in Mumbai by Islamist gunmen that killed 166 people and hiked tensions with nuclear-armed Pakistan. Playing on many investors' minds is the fear of an unstable government, as tens of millions of jobs have already been lost in the economic slowdown. Many of Congress' economic reforms were blocked in its five years in power by the communists, who had propped up the government. There are also investor worries over the rise of a group of smaller parties, known as the ""Third Front"", who are often seen as opportunist and an unknown quantity in government. Highlighting India's internal security woes, states such as Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand will vote on Thursday in the face of stepped-up Maoist attacks on security forces. The rebels warned they will cut off the hands of those who dare vote. Dozens of people have been killed in Maoist violence in the past week and at least 20 died in separate gunbattles between police and insurgents in eastern India on Wednesday"
en.15.119.89.2009.4.12,Fight breaks out during Georgia street protests,"TBILISI, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tensions flared on Saturday during the third day of an opposition street campaign in Georgia against President Mikheil Saakashvili with the authorities and protesters trading blame for a fight at the protest venue. Opposition leaders said a 50-strong mob had attacked the venue, tearing banners and ripping out computer cables at a stage set up outside parliament as dozens of protesters prepared to spend a third night on the street. Police, however, said protesters had set on street cleaners who arrived to clear the site of litter. Up to 5,000 people rallied on Saturday, a sharp drop from the previous two days when 60,000 and then 20,000 took to the streets to demand Saakashvili quit over his record on democracy and last year's disastrous war with Russia. Saakashvili has refused to resign, and instead offered dialogue. Some opposition leaders said on Friday they had agreed, but the details of a possible meeting have not been set. ""That's the government's response to its own proposal for dialogue,"" Salome Zurabishvili, one of the opposition leaders, told reporters after the clash. ""This is an insult to the Georgian people and an insult to any dialogue,"" she said. CRACKDOWN The Georgian Interior Ministry released a statement denying any involvement. It blamed protesters, who on Saturday again blocked three main roads in the capital. ""When the cleaning crew arrived, they were accosted and physically attacked by civilians who were participating in the demonstrations,"" the statement said. It said police were exercising a policy of ""staying away"" to avoid confrontation. Analysts warn tensions risk boiling over into unrest. The West is watching closely for a possible repeat of a 2007 crackdown, when police firing teargas and rubber bullets dispersed the last peaceful demonstrations against Saakashvili. The 41-year-old president has polarized opinion in the former Soviet republic since coming to power after the 2003 Rose Revolution. Critics accuse him of monopolizing power and exerting pressure on the judiciary and media. Opposition has grown since Georgia's five-day war with Russia last year, when Moscow crushed a Georgian assault on breakaway South Ossetia. But diplomats question whether the alliance of more than a dozen opposition parties can maintain unity or muster enough people to force Saakashvili out. Analysts say the president's ruling United National Movement retains wide support and his position appears strong, despite the defection of some top allies and several cabinet reshuffles. Many Georgians appear frustrated with political bickering and are sympathetic to government calls for stability as the global economic crisis takes hold"
en.15.119.31.2009.4.11,Fiji president reappoints former coup leader as PM,"SUVA, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fiji's president reappointed former coup leader Commodore Frank Bainimarama to head the politically unstable South Pacific nation's government on Saturday, less than two days after a court ruled his 2006 coup illegal. Fiji has suffered four coups and a bloody military mutiny since 1987, mainly as a result of tensions between the majority indigenous Fijian population and the economically powerful ethnic Indian minority. Bainimarama was sworn in as caretaker prime minister in the morning by President Ratu Josefa Iloilo, who Friday annulled the 1997 constitution and sacked the entire judiciary, including the judges who declared Bainimarama's former government illegal Thursday. ""He just came, he read the oath and he was appointed as prime minister,"" a local journalist told Reuters by telephone. In the afternoon Bainimarama, who is also military chief, reappointed nine ministers in his former government to the same posts. They were sworn in by the 88-year-old Iloilo, an ethnic Fijian like Bainimarama. Bainimarama came to power in a bloodless coup in 2006. On Thursday, in a case brought by former prime minister Laisenia Qarase, the Court of Appeal overturned an earlier judgment that the military chief's government was legal, and called for a new government led by neither man pending fresh elections. Bainimarama initially said he would step down. But after annulling the constitution Friday, the president enacted emergency powers for the country's military and police, initially for 30 days but with the possibility of extension. Iloilo also issued a decree giving himself the power to appoint a prime minister by decree and other ministers on the advice of the prime minister. These powers are to remain in force until a parliament is elected under a new constitution yet to be adopted. Iloilo has called for fresh elections in 2014. However, his actions have been widely criticized overseas. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has criticized the annulment of Fiji's constitution and called for it to be reversed. Despite the political upheavals, the situation in Suva has remained generally calm for the Easter weekend. In an address to the nation Saturday, Bainimarama called for all sections of society, including the media, to cooperate with the emergency regulations and promised elections by September 2014. He said Iloilo had no choice but to abrogate the constitution as a result of the ""anomaly"" in the judges' decision and ""the serious consequent vacuum created by that decision."" One of the three judges involved in Thursday's decision, Australian Randall Powell, warned of a legal vacuum in Fiji as a result of the president's suspension of the judiciary, with large numbers of cases potentially going untried. Powell has returned to Australia since the decision. ""It seems that Commodore Bainimarama has shown his true colors,"" Powell told Australia's SBS television. IMPACT ON ECONOMY Australian Trade Minister Simon Crean said Saturday the events in Suva were likely to further damage Fiji's economy, which has suffered since the coup. Thursday, the Reserve Bank of Fiji predicted that the economy would contract by 0.3 percent in 2009, compared with an expansion of 2.4 percent in 2008. A leading analyst said Fiji could expect tightening of sanctions and action from both the Commonwealth and the Pacific Islands Forum, while tourists were likely to be scared off. ""It is certainly a circumvention of any democratic process, or any return to democratic process. It also shows that Fiji is not a country at the moment that is governed by the rule of law,"" analyst Damien Kingsbury told Reuters. ""Fiji also relies heavily on tourism. I think tourists these days are increasingly gun shy,"" added Kingsbury, associate professor in the School of International and Political Studies at Australia's Deakin University. A former British colony, Fiji has been wracked by ethnic divisions ever since independence in 1970. A 1990 constitution cemented ethnic Fijian rule of Fiji and led to heavy emigration by ethnic Indians. The 1997 constitution annulled Friday was seen as more equitable, but quickly led to the election in 1999 of a government led by an ethnic Indian. A civilian-led coup in 2000 was followed by elections in 2001 and 2006, but civilian rule ended in December 2006 when Bainimarama's coup overturned Qarase's government."
en.15.119.63.2009.4.13,Over half of O/S calls go through illegal VoIP: TIOB,"Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)Illegal VoIP operations are on the rise, grabbing more than half of the overseas calls trade in Bangladesh, due to lack of government control, said industry leaders on Sunday. Telecom infrastructure providers say development of the Tk 3,500-crore international calls sector will remain a far cry until the government takes effective measures, especially against unregulated VSAT use. ""The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has been asked to reinforce its measures against illegal VoIP, but it's been hindered in the aftermath of the BDR incident,"" said Mir Nasir Hossain, president of TIOB (Telecommunication Infrastructure Operators of Bangladesh). He said the BTRC's newly appointed chairman Zia Ahmed had assured them, however, of soon resuming the drive against the illegal operators. Nasir said measures must also be put in place for limiting the use of VSATsmall and very portable satellite dishes for easy connection to the Internetto put an end to illegal VoIP calls, suggesting VSAT use be limited only to corporate houses. The TIOB president was addressing a 'Meet the Press' in the capital organised by his association, comprising some nine BTRC licensees who provide telecom infrastructure, including International Gateways (IGW), Inter Connect Exchanges (ICX), International Internet Gateways (IIG), National Telecommunication Transmission Networks (NTTN) and submarine cable. He said the recently introduced International Gateway licences have helped raise the legal volume of international calls to 2.3 crore minutes from the previous 1.5 crore minutes. Three private IGW operators of Bangladesh have added over Tk 150 crore to public coffers since August last year. They also paid Tk 60 crore in licence fees, he said. But, he added, the government was still losing huge amounts of revenue, with illegal VoIP businesses transferring profits abroad through illegal hundi transactions. He also pointed out that criminals choose to use VoIP as these calls go unchecked. Arshad Jamal, of Novo Tel Ltd, said the three private IGWs and the state-run BTCL's IGW are capable of handling the entire voice traffic of Bangladesh. But the illegal VoIP market is still controlling more than 50 percent of the trade, ""throwing a tough challenge to the licensed operators"", he said. The TIOB president said the ongoing global recession was also reducing the volume of international calls. ""In the last few years, international calls saw a 15 to 20 percent rise, but that volume has dropped again recently due to the economic downturn,"" said Nasir. Bangla Trac Communications Ltd managing director Tarique E Haque, GETCO Telecommunications Ltd's Hafizr Rahman, Mango Teleservices Ltd's Mir Masud Kabir and M&H Telecom Ltd's Didarul Islam also spoke on ICX and IIG operations. bdne"

""The six officers were deputed to the Chittagong region coastguard at the time of the seizure at CUFL jetty,"" CID senior assistant superintendent Moniruzzaman Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. Of the officers, two are now in Dhaka and four others in Chittagong, he said. But he did not reveal their names. Moniruzzaman said they were grilled about the coastguard's role during the offloading of the arms on Apr 1 2004. He did not say what information, if any, the officers divulged. He said the six were the first of 38 former coastguard officers summoned by CID. Two accused Din Mohammad and Hafiz, who are now in jail, had previously ""confessed"" to the investigators that several coastguard officers abetted them in offloading arms at the CUFL jetty. The 38 were called on the basis of the confessions, the investigation officer said. On Apr 13, the CID petitioned a Chittagong court seeking five days to grill former CUFL managing director Mohsin Talukdar and former general manager Enamul Haque for a second time.

en.15.119.110.2009.4.14,Phil Spector convicted of murder,"LOS ANGELES, Tue Apr 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eccentric music producer Phil Spector was convicted on Monday of murdering a Hollywood actress in 2003, and will likely spend the rest of his life in prison. In his second trial, held after jurors deadlocked in 2007, Spector, 69, was found guilty of second-degree murder by a Los Angeles jury. The man once revered for revolutionizing pop music in the 1960s with his layered ""Wall of Sound"" production technique, faces 18 years to life behind bars when he is sentenced on May 29. Lana Clarkson, 40, a B-movie actress, died of a shot to the mouth, fired from Spector's gun in the foyer of his home outside Los Angeles on February 3, 2003. The two met hours earlier at a Hollywood nightclub. California criminal defense attorney Darren Kavinoky said Spector could be paroled only after spending the initial 18 years in prison. ""He's got a better chance of winning the lottery than ever being released,"" said Kavinoky, who was not involved in the case. Spector, who worked with The Ronettes, The Beatles, Cher and Leonard Cohen at the height of his fame, denied murdering Clarkson. His lawyers said on Monday they would appeal. He did not testify at either trial and although his hands shook while the verdict was read, he showed little emotion. He was taken into custody immediately after the verdict. SPECTOR 'HAS A PROBLEM WITH RAGE'-PROSECUTOR Prosecutors argued that the shooting of Clarkson was part of a pattern of gun play and violence that Spector displayed toward women. After the verdict, prosecutor Alan Jackson told reporters Spector ""has a problem with rage, and he is a bully."" Spector's lawyers claimed that Clarkson was depressed about her failing career and committed suicide. She worked as a hostess at the House of Blues in Hollywood when she met the man who produced songs like the Righteous Brothers' hit ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin.'"" Clarkson starred in such little-known movies as ""Barbarian Queen"" and ""Amazon Women on the Moon."" Clarkson's family, who also filed a wrongful death civil suit against Spector, said they were ""pleased that the jury had rejected the distortion and trashing of (her) life by the defense."" ""Justice has been served,"" they said in a statement. ""Mr. Spector has to take responsibility for his actions."" The two long trials featured testimony from five women and a jury visit to the mock castle where the reclusive Spector lived. None of his old pop music friends testified in his defense. Spector attorney Doron Weinberg criticized the decision to allow several female witnesses to testify about incidents dating back 20 years. It ""left us with very little of a chance to have a fair trial,"" Weinberg said. The jury forewoman told reporters the panel based their decision on the totality of the evidence, rather than specific incidents. Spector had a troubled early life. His father committed suicide, his sister spent time in mental institutions and Spector suffered bouts of severe depression. Shortly before Clarkson was shot, Spector told British journalist Mick Brown in a rare interview that he had a bipolar personality and had ""devils that fight inside me."" In 2006, he quietly wed for the fourth time, marrying model/actress Rachelle Short, who is about 30 years his ju"
en.15.119.233.2009.4.15,Workers 'sucking up' bad for business: experts,"By Ellen Wulfhorst NEW YORK, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If there's a bit more false flattery and loud enthusiasm at the office than usual, don't be surprised. Whether it's called buttering up the boss, brown-nosing, sucking up or managing up, experts say ingratiating behavior is bound to be on the rise in the workplace as workers fret about keeping their jobs in tough economic times. But such behavior can be bad for business, they said. ""People who tend to 'manage up' anyway are managing up more. They really want to make sure people are noticing what they're doing,"" said Max Caldwell, an expert in workforce effectiveness at Towers Perrin management consultants. ""It's a mentality of 'I not only want to do a good job, but I want to be seen as doing a good job,'"" he said. That behavior increases when stakes are high, said Jennifer Chatman, professor of organizational behavior at the University of California at Berkeley. ""It's what we do when we feel ourselves vulnerable or susceptible to the decisions of others,"" she said. ""I would have every expectation that if we went out and tried to collect data right now, that it was going on in a big way because people are feeling more vulnerable."" In such an environment, underlings may be more likely to lavish praise on bad decisions or poor judgment by a boss and avoid being candid or bearing bad news, she said. ""It can be bad for business, keeping the yea-sayers around,"" Chatman said. But according to some researchers, sucking up works. Challenging a chief executive less, complimenting the CEO more and doing the CEO a personal favor increased the likelihood of being appointed to a corporate board by 64 percent, a University of Texas study found. COME IN FIVE MINUTES EARLIER In a separate study that Chatman conducted, job-seekers using ingratiating behavior were 20 percent more likely to land a job. It's human nature, she said. ""People who bring positive information, that stroke the boss, that make the boss feel good about the decisions he or she has made, that build up the boss' confidence, those people are going to do better,"" she said. It's nothing to be ashamed of, said Frances Cole Jones, a professional coach and author of ""How to Wow."" In tough times, she said, go to work early, stay late, attend meetings and volunteer for extra work. ""In times like these, the smart thing to do is to 'suck up' -- or, perhaps, 're-commit,'"" she said. ""These days employees need to be flexible, ambidextrous, creative and committed."" Stephen Viscusi, author of ""Bulletproof Your Job,"" suggested a simple change in work habits. ""If you come in five minutes earlier than the boss and stay five minutes later, the boss doesn't know how long you're there. He just knows that you're always working,"" he said. Francie Dalton, who runs Dalton Alliances Inc. management consultants, said criticizing a colleague as a way to suck-up may signal envy. ""If you think somebody is sucking up, consider whether you might be jealous. Consider whether you're getting nervous because that person is outpacing, outshining and outdoing you,"" she said. Others like author Bill Hanover rule out ingratiating behavior altogether. ""If you value self-respect, the respect of your peers and leaders, then sucking-up or faking your way to a promotion will leave you ashamed and wanting,"" writes Hanover, the author of ""No Sucking Up."" ""Don't do it. And like the old drunk driving ad campaign states, 'Friends don't let friends suck-up,'"" he wr"
en.15.119.297.2009.4.14,North Korea says to re-start nuclear arms plant,"SEOUL, Tue Apr 14,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea said on Tuesday it was no longer bound by an international nuclear disarmament deal and would re-start its plant that makes arms-grade plutonium after the UN chastised it for launching a long-range rocket. The UN Security Council on Monday unanimously condemned North Korea's long-range rocket launch nearly two weeks ago as contravening a UN ban, and demanded enforcement of existing sanctions against Pyongyang. The UN measures for a launch widely seen as a disguised test of a long-range missile will have little immediate impact on the North's faltering economy and the divided international response could embolden leader Kim Jong-il, analysts said. North Korea said the six-country nuclear talks ""have become useless,"" and it ""will no longer be bound by any agreement being made at the six-party talks,"" its KCNA news agency quoted its Foreign Ministry as saying. ""We will actively consider building our own light-water nuclear reactor, will revive nuclear facilities and reprocess used nuclear fuel rods,"" the ministry said. North Korea began taking apart its Soviet-era Yongbyon nuclear plant more than a year ago as a part of a disarmament-for-aid deal it reached with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States. Russia's Foreign Ministry regrets North Korea's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program, state news agency RIA Novosti reported on Tuesday. The steps in total were aimed at taking a year to reverse but experts said the North could have its plant that separates plutonium from spent fuel rods up running again in as little as three months. ""North Korea's statements are always a mixture of bluff and real threats, but I think the threats are more real this time, and I think they'll continue for the next few months at least,"" said Shi Yinhong, a regional security expert at Renmin University in Beijing. CHINA AND NORTH KOREA Analysts said China, which shares a border with North Korea and is the closest thing Pyongyang can claim as a major ally, is unlikely to use its crucial position of enforcing UN sanctions in order to avoid destabilizing its destitute neighbor. Chinese officials had called for restraint for what many saw as a disguised test of a long-range missile but by now joining the condemnation, Beijing has stoked uncertainty about how it intends to balance ties with Pyongyang against pressure from regional powers, which could have long-term implications. ""It means China is paying much more attention to the United States and Japan, and less to North Korea and its relations with North Korea,"" said Shi. The new U.N. measures may cause Beijing to curb trade in a few items but it will keep its flow of energy, grains and other materials that prop up the North's broken down economy. Japan urged North Korea to accept the Security Council statement and to resume stalled nuclear talks. ""We will urge North Korea to accept the president's statement issued at the Security Council early this morning,"" Japanese Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Yasuhisa Kawamura said. ""In particular, we support the idea of resuming the six-party talks at an early stage."" The US-authored statement, agreed on Saturday by the five permanent council members and Japan, ordered a UN sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years"

en.15.119.48.2009.4.14,"Sri Lanka, Tigers trade blame over fighting in truce","COLOMBO, Tue Apr 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka and the Tamil Tiger rebels traded blame on Tuesday over combat during a two-day holiday fighting pause, which the separatist rebels said fell short of the full ceasefire they are demanding. With more than 50,000 soldiers surrounding a 17-square km (7 sq mile) no-fire zone where the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are holding tens of thousands of civilians, President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Sunday ordered troops into a defensive stance for the next two days. Those days coincide with New Year celebrations by Sri Lanka's Sinhalese and Tamil populations, and Rajapaksa urged the Tigers to surrender and free the people they are keeping as human shields in the face of an imminent conventional defeat. The LTTE Peace Secretariat, in an e-mailed statement, said Rajapaksa's call was ""merely an act of hoodwinking"". ""We consider this ceasefire announcement of (the) Sri Lanka government as a two-day holiday opportunity availed to its servicemen,"" it said. ""The Sinhala Forces are continuing to target the civilian population with their bombs and guns."" The Defence Ministry said soldiers had ""strictly observed the humanitarian pause"" while the Tigers on Monday had fired machineguns throughout the day, and occasionally artillery. One soldier was killed by sniper fire, it said. The United Nations and rights groups have accused the government of shelling civilian areas. The government says this is Tiger propaganda designed to create international pressure for a truce. Thousands of Tamils in the diaspora have protested en masse for a ceasefire in cities around the world, but that has done little except infuriate Colombo -- especially after protesters in Oslo broke into the Sri Lankan embassy and trashed it. Sri Lanka then protested to Norway and said it should no longer serve as a mediator in the peace process. Norway brokered a 2002 truce that fell apart in 2006, but has remained the international community's main link to the rebels. The Tigers repeated that they would comply with an immediate ceasefire for political discussions with no preconditions. ""We wish to point out that a ceasefire under the auspices of the international community alone will be effective and productive,"" the statement said. However, diplomats trying to broker a deal to get the civilians out say the Tigers have refused to let people go. The United Nations says they are shooting those trying to flee, and forcing others to fight or do battlefield labour. The LTTE denies that and says people are staying by choice, despite the fact more than 65,000 fled Tiger areas this year. The government remains steadfast that the Tigers must surrender or face annihilation. It says past truces during which the Tigers rearmed are proof of the LTTE's disingenuousness.

en.15.119.338.2009.4.15,Thailand aims to revive economy after protests end,"BANGKOK, Wed Apr 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Thai government considered new measures to revive the economy on Wednesday, a day after the end of violent protests that further dented confidence in a country heading into recession. A state of emergency imposed in the capital on Sunday remained in place and security forces tightly guarded the area around the prime minister's office, the epicenter of protests the past three weeks. Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij told the Financial Times that Thailand may expand its stimulus package and increase borrowing to boost confidence and deal with the economic costs of political turmoil. ""We were already anticipating revenue shortfalls in the current fiscal year and that shortfall is almost certainly going to be larger now as a result of what happened over the last 72 hours and so we are going to have to make sure we have sufficient fiscal space,"" he said in an interview. Regardless of whatever fiscal measures the government may adopt, few believe the end of this round of protests heralds a sustainable return of stability to Thailand's politics. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's position has been strengthened, but opposition to him remains strong and the ""red shirt"" protesters have vowed to return even though some of their leaders have been arrested. Financial markets were closed for the three-day Thai New Year holiday, but will reopen on Thursday. Shares and the baht were expected to come under selling pressure. Tisco Securities strategist Viwat Techapoonphol expected foreign selling to lop between 3 and 5 percent off the main Thai stock index, which has failed to join in the rally on other bourses in recent weeks due to the political crisis. ""Selling pressure will come from foreign funds constrained by their policy of not investing in countries where there is a state of emergency in place,"" he said. The locally-driven bond market would be ""influenced positively"" by the developments, said Edward Lee, regional head of fixed income strategy for Asia at Standard Chartered Bank. Thailand's five-year CDS narrowed to 205/220 bps from 210/230 on Tuesday, but sentiment remains fragile after the finance minister's comments. Moody's and Standard & Poor's, which already have a negative outlook for Thailand's sovereign ratings, said on Monday that renewed political unrest this week had increased the risk of a sovereign downgrade. Though markets will open, the government has extended the New Year holiday the rest of the week to control the flow of people back into Bangkok, because some protesters may come in from the countryside in a mood to fight, authorities said. ARREST WARRANTS Police said arrest warrants had been issued for former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the exiled figurehead of the ""red shirt"" protest movement, and 13 leaders of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD) for violating state of emergency regulations. At least three were already in custody. Army spokesman Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd said late on Tuesday a few hundred protesters, not wearing their usual red shirts, had gathered in an open space near the royal palace, but they had been dispersed without force before midnight. Newspapers that had lambasted the prime minister for the collapse of an Asian summit at the weekend after protesters invaded the venue in the resort town of Pattaya, praised his handling of the violence in Bangkok. ""The government ... should be commended for their demonstration of restraint in the handling of the rioting and, more importantly, for the judgment in not rushing for a final break-up of the protesters at Government House, even though they had the capability to do so and the legitimacy as well,"" the Bangkok Post said in an editorial. Two people died in skirmishes between locals and ""red shirts,"" the authorities said, while more than 100 were injured in clashes between soldiers and protesters trying to blockade a major road junction on Monday. But a three-week occupation of Government House, Abhisit's office, ended without bloodshed on Tuesday when Thaksin supporters decided to surrender with hundreds of troops and riot police surrounding them. Thailand's intractable political divide broadly pits royalists, the military and the urban middle-class against the rural poor loyal to Tha"
en.15.119.470.2009.4.11,UK rejects Pakistan criticism on counter-terrorism,"LONDON, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain rejected Pakistani criticism over security screening on Friday as police in northwest England investigated a suspected al Qaeda plot involving Pakistani nationals who entered on student visas. Immigration minister Phil Woolas described as a ""red herring"" criticism from Pakistan's high commissioner of British checks on foreign students. Responding to British demands that Pakistan do more to combat terrorism, the diplomat, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said Pakistani authorities could help carry out background checks on student visa applicants but had not been allowed to. ""It is at your end, you have to do something more...Every day we are raiding people...we are arresting suspects wherever we find them,"" Hasan told BBC television. ""If they allow us to make inquiries first, if they ask us to scrutinise those people who are seeking visas, we can help them."" In a major counter-terrorism operation, police on Wednesday arrested 12 people including 11 Pakistani nationals, all but one of whom were on student visas. None has yet been charged. Police said on Friday they were searching a 10th address, in the northwest city of Liverpool. Most terrorist plots in Britain since Sept. 11, 2001 have had links to Pakistan, including suicide bombings in July 2005 which killed 52 people on London's underground and bus network. Prime Minister Gordon Brown told Al Jazeera television that ""most of al Qaeda's base is in Pakistan"" and ""we need all the cooperation that we have with the Pakistani authorities"" to deal with terrorists operating from that country. ORDERS FROM PAKISTAN ""Two-thirds of terrorist plots that we've had to identify and deal with in Britain, either successful or unsuccessful plots, have originated from Pakistan, and clearly instruction's been made from leaders in Pakistan rather than in Britain,"" said Brown, who spoke with Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari by telephone on Thursday night. His office said they agreed their countries ""share a serious threat from terrorism and violent extremism"", and had committed to ""work together to address this common challenge"". Immigration minister Woolas said entrance requirements for foreign students were tightened last week. ""There is no evidence to suggest that these people, who may be involved in a terrorist plot, were not studying at university,"" he told Sky News. ""People aren't terrorists or students, they are sometimes both. I think there's a bit of a red herring going on in this idea that the visa check overseas would have stopped some of these operations."" Some security experts have warned for years of a threat from Islamist militants based at British universities, including foreigners on student visas. Wednesday's raids had to be brought forward because of a security blunder by Britain's top counter-terrorism officer, Bob Quick, who was photographed entering Brown's 10 Downing Street residence carrying a secret document on the operation. The document, headlined ""Briefing Note: Operation Pathway"" and marked ""secret"", described it as a ""Security Service-led investigation into suspected AQ (al Qaeda) driven attack planning within the UK"". Quick resigned on Thursday, acknowledging that ""my action could have compromised a major counter-terrorism operation""."

en.15.119.414.2009.4.13,Pakistan's Sharif invited back to government,"ISLAMABAD, Mon Apr 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani has asked former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's party to rejoin the government but Sharif's party said on Monday it was unlikely to do so. Political tension in nuclear-armed Pakistan has eased considerably since last month, when the government gave in to opposition demands to reinstate a controversial Supreme Court chief. The Supreme Court later cleared the way for Sharif's party, the country's second biggest party, to resume as the governing party in Punjab, Pakistan's biggest and politically most important province. But the country is also grappling with rising Islamist militant violence while struggling to revive a sagging economy. Analysts say the government, led by President Asif Ali Zardari's Pakistan People's Party (PPP), wants Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) back in the coalition it left last year to share the burden -- and the blame for any failings. ""The political forces of the country now should join hands to thwart the evil designs of its enemies,"" Gilani said in a statement late on Sunday after inviting the PML-N back into the coalition it left over a dispute with the PPP over the judiciary. The two biggest parties had a common objective to strengthen democratic institutions and to steer the country out of its present challenges, Gilani said. PML-N spokesman Siddiqul Farooq said Sharif would respond to Gilani's offer after consulting party leaders and workers. But he said the party would prefer to remain in opposition. ""We want them to serve the country for another four years so that when we go to the electorate, they can judge the performance of both parties,"" he said. ""I think they're feeling that they're not capable of solving problems."" SERIOUS PRESSURE Political wrangling alarms the United States and other Western allies who want the government to focus on its economy and on tackling militancy in the northwest. The United States says eliminating militant sanctuaries in remote norwestern border regions is essential for stability in neighbouring Afghanistan, and for defeating al Qaeda. Sharif served as prime minister twice during the 1990s, alternating with his then bitter rival, PPP leader Benazir Bhutto. Bhutto was assassinated in 2007 and her widower, Zardari, took over as party leader and later become president. Sharif's rule was dogged by accusations of corruption and he clashed with the Supreme Court and sections of the media. Critics say he also flirted with Islamists to bolster his position, which analysts say has made the United States wary of him. Sharif was ousted in a 1999 coup by then army chief Pervez Musharraf, who stepped down as president last year. Polls show Sharif is Pakistan's most popular politician partly because of his steadfast opposition to Musharraf and his support for the judiciary. Zardari is also unpopular and if the PPP is seen as failing to tackle problems, Sharif's party would be set to easily win the next general election, due by 2013, analysts say. ""The government is under serious security and economic pressure and wants them to re-join rather than criticise from outside,"" said political analyst Hassan Askari Rizvi. ""But why should they take the blame at this stage? They'll wait and see ... they're eying the next elect"
en.15.119.174.2009.4.15,'Campus unrest only blemish in 100 days in office',"Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)A 100 days into office, campus violence by pro-Awami League students has been the only ""scar"" of the new government, according to several ministers. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, they said the failure will not deter the government from carrying out the tasks at hand. The ministers spelled climate change, implementation of election manifesto and global economic downturn, among other issues, as the tough challenges facing the administration of Sheikh Hasina in her second stint as prime minister. The supporters of the AL's student front Bangladesh Chhatra League clashed among themselves and with others for control over the past months, leaving at least two top leaders killed and scores wounded. They cited Hasina's giving up the role of organisational chief of student organisation and recent arrests of BCL's two central committee leaders as steps to end politics of violence. ""A conspiracy like BDR bloodbath could not stop the government as it has been working sincerely since its first day in office,"" planning minister AK Khandker said. ""There's no doubt the country will move ahead if the current pace is maintained."" According to him, protecting the country from climate change impacts is the biggest challenge for the new government completing its first 100 days Thursday. The AL-led alliance won a historic landslide in Dec. 29 general election last year and took oath on Jan. 6. Khandker said the government decided to stage trials for crimes committed during the 1971 independence war on the very first day of the opening session of the ninth parliament. The trial will kick off once the investigation agency is appointed officer and tribunal formed. The minister, also head of 'Sectors Commander Forum', a body of sector commanders of independence war, said he is sanguine about the law and home ministries appointing an experienced and competent investigation officer. Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury said she did not want to evaluate the government's hundred days in the office, as she believed in ""five-year plans"". She, however said it is the people who will judge the government. ""The people have already started to evaluate the government which is why no gains could be made from such a big conspiracy,"" Matia said, referring to the February's bloody BDR mutiny that left at least 70 army officers deputed to the border guards killed. Commerce minister Faruq Khan also said on Apr. 13 unrest at educational institutions countrywide has been a source of embarrassment to the government in its first 100-day in office. He had spelled out law and order, militancy and war crimes trial as the tough challenges facing the government. Aviation minister GM Quader, an MP of the AL's election ally Jatiya Party, said the government has taken up initiatives to implement its election pledges in the first 100 days. Prices of essentials have started coming down on the government's realistic steps and will fall, he said. Quader saw ""few social changes"" although he said the government has improved the law and order. He believes they will face the toughest challenge to implement the grand alliance's election manifesto. On the BCL factional clashes, the aviation minister said the prime minister has asked for actions to end violence. The ongoing global economic downturn tat is yet to cast its full spell on Bangladesh's economy will present the biggest challenge, state minister for foreign affairs Hasan Mahmud thinks. He said the government's homework to spot problems and teamwork helped curb the spiralling prices. He said the campus unrest obviously hurt the government but pointed out that it did took steps to put an end to instability at the educational institutions. He spoke for intensified coordination among the ministries of foreign, expatriates welfare and overseas employment and labour to boost manpower export and foreign currency earnings. bd"
en.15.119.119.2009.4.10,Japan marks 50th anniversary of 'commoner' empress,"TOKYO, Fri Apr 10,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko were set to throw a golden wedding tea party for 100 couples on Friday, marking 50 years since Michiko became the first commoner to marry into the cloistered imperial household. The milestone has sparked a wave of nostalgia in the media about the early days of their marriage, when the young woman dubbed ""Mitchy"" became a fashion icon and a potent symbol of a new, forward-looking Japan. ""Japan was young then, too,"" read one magazine headline, listing the milestones of the 1960s, including the Tokyo Olympics and the opening of the high-speed ""bullet"" train network. In an interview published to mark the anniversary, Akihito, 75, said he was looking forward to meeting the other couples, who all celebrate their golden wedding anniversaries this year. ""Around the time when the empress and I were married, although people's lives were not necessarily rich, everyone was filled with hope and looking forward to the future,"" he said. Michiko's modern style was a major factor in her popularity. Photos show her in a full-skirted 1950s dress bidding farewell to her kimono-clad mother on the day of her wedding. As crown princess she went on to experiment with the styles of the 1960s and 1970s, including mini-skirts. All was carefully thought out, especially her tiny hats, which she favours to allow her to sit close to people without forcing them to dodge a wide brim. Born Michiko Shoda, the eldest daughter of a wealthy flour company executive, she met the then-crown prince at a tennis tournament. They married in a 1959 ceremony watched by millions of Japanese on television sets many families were said to have purchased especially for the occasion. That new openness helped breach the divide between the imperial family and the public and establish their image as an ""ordinary"" middle-class couple. Japan's ruler was venerated as a living god until Akihito's late father Emperor Hirohito denied their divine status after World War Two. Michiko, 74, broke another tradition, and won popular acclaim, when she chose to raise their three children at home rather than send them to a private tutor outside the palace, even making them packed lunches to take to school. ""Fifty years ago when I left an ordinary family to join the new environment of the imperial family, my heart was filled with uncertainty and anxiety,"" Michiko said in an interview published to mark the anniversary. ""For me to be here today by his majesty's side, welcoming our golden wedding anniversary, truly seems to be as if in a dream."" SUFFERING BEHIND THE SCENES But the fairy tale was only part of Michiko's story -- she lost weight and suffered health problems some commentators blamed on bullying by the courtiers of the Imperial Household Agency. Similar rumours surfaced late in 1993 after Michiko collapsed and temporarily lost the ability to speak, a reaction attributed by some to tabloid reports that she was shrewish and made excessive demands on palace staff. In March 2007 she was forced to rest for more than a week after showing symptoms of intestinal bleeding, which the Imperial Household Agency said was likely caused by stress. She once spoke to reporters of her lapses of confidence and said she would like to hide behind a ""cloak of invisibility"" so she could browse in second-hand bookshops and visit museums without bothering other people. Michiko's difficulties were mirrored by the stress-induced mental illness of Crown Princess Masako, a former diplomat who is the wife of her eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito. Known for her eagerness to communicate with ordinary Japanese, Michiko famously knelt and embraced weeping victims of the 1995 Kobe earthquake during a visit with her husband to a shelter for those who had lost their homes. An English literature graduate from Sacred Heart Women's University in Tokyo, Michiko takes a keen interest in the arts and has written a children's book and translated two volumes of poetry for chil"

The march through central London was the biggest yet in a week of demonstrations by Tamils and their supporters in London and other cities. Sri Lanka's military has said that troops have confined Tamil Tiger rebels to a small area of the Indian Ocean island's northeast coast in what could be the last act of the 25-year civil war. The United Nations has said the rebels have kept more than 100,000 civilians as human shields. Police said 100,000 people took part in the London demonstration, organised by a British Tamil group. Three people were arrested for public order offences, a police spokeswoman said. The protesters marched behind red Tamil flags and carried placards bearing slogans such as ""Stop Sri Lanka's genocide of Tamils"". One marcher carried a bloodied baby doll in a cardboard box. Tamil supporters have staged demonstrations in London since last Monday when 3,000 people occupied a central London bridge next to parliament's clock tower, known as Big Ben.

The defeat left Hamburg in third place, level on 51 points with second-placed Bayern Munich who beat Eintracht Frankfurt 4-0 on Saturday. Stuttgart moved to within a point of fourth-placed Hertha Berlin who are on 49 points. The top two teams qualify for the Champions League, the third plays Champions League qualifiers while the fourth and fifth-placed teams qualify for what will next year be known as the Europa League. VfL Wolfsburg top the standings with 54 points after defeating lowly Borussia Moenchengladbach 2-1 on Saturday. Stuttgart were the more aggressive side and deserved the win, while Hamburg looked tired after their midweek 3-1 win against Manchester City in the UEFA Cup. ""I had already settled for a 0-0,"" Stuttgart coach Markus Babbel told reporters. ""But the boys wanted the win. We continuously tried to create chances and at the end we were rewarded."" The hosts twice demanded a penalty for what they said were a handball and a foul on Timo Gebhart and television replays showed Hamburg were lucky to get away with both. While Stuttgart repeatedly threatened through Thomas Hitzlsperger, Ciprian Marica and Gomez, Hamburg largely depended on quick counter attacks targeting striker Ivica Olic. OLIC THREAT Olic came close twice just before the break with the Croatian first chasing a long ball down the left and firing wide and then hitting the crossbar with a curled shot. The hosts were again more willing to attack in the second half, coming close with shots from substitute Julian Schieber, Gomez and Hitzlsperger. Hamburg almost grabbed the win in the 90th minute when Dennis Aogo hit the bar with a thundering drive from 16 metres. But it was Stuttgart who grabbed full points when Gomez pounced on a loose ball in the box after Hamburg keeper Frank Rost saved a Hitzlsperger low drive, to drill the ball home deep in stoppage time for his 15th league goal of the season. ""If you cannot get three points from a match you should at least get one,"" Hamburg coach Martin Jol said. ""But it is extremely bitter not to have any after this match. For 90 minutes I was satisfied with the performance of my team."" In the day's only other match, Bayer Leverkusen lost ground in their bid to claim a European spot when they drew 1-1 with Werder Bremen. They are in ninth place on 42 point"

en.15.119.471.2009.4.13,Medical researchers face conflicts of interest,"CHICAGO, Mon Apr 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dr Bruce Psaty of University of Washington in Seattle knows how easy it can be to fall under the spell of a friendly relationship with drug companies. As an assistant professor, he published an article on using beta-blockers to treat high blood pressure that caught the attention of the pharmaceutical industry. ""My family and I were invited to a first-class resort, where I presented the results at a sponsored conference,"" Psaty wrote in a commentary this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association. He agreed to help develop a set of slides on beta-blockers and soon found himself suggesting that the drug company's studies be featured, in part because he felt ""a kind of social duty to reciprocate both the kindness and the investment made by the sponsor in the slide set."" Psaty said his own story illustrates the subtleties of conflicts of interest. He is dissatisfied with the current debate among doctors, spurred by reports last year by Iowa Republican Senator Charles Grassley that a prominent Harvard psychiatrist failed to fully disclose hefty payments from drug companies. ""The debate has not been terribly fruitful,"" Psaty said in a telephone interview. He said conflicts are sometimes hard to recognize, pointing to the work of Dan Ariely, a behavioral economist at Duke University in North Carolina. Ariely's research suggests that most people are comfortable with just a little bit of cheating, without considering themselves dishonest. He says subtle conflicts of interest often color decision making, yet most people -- especially doctors -- think they are immune. HUMAN INSTINCT ""It's human instinct,"" Ariely said in a telephone interview. ""If someone does something nice -- gives you $5 million in a research grant -- don't you want to do something nice back to them?"" Ariely said return favors could come in the form of excluding a sicker patient from a clinical trial, which might affect the study results. ""Not on purpose, but I'm trying to help my friends, just a little bit."" Several states including Massachusetts, Minnesota and Vermont are tightening restrictions on gifts to doctors in the hopes of preventing such conflicts. And a bill introduced by Senators Grassley and Wisconsin Democrat Herb Kohl would compel doctors to disclose their financial ties with drug companies or face stiff fines. Psaty said such laws may curb some financial conflicts, but a bigger challenge will be addressing the influence drugmakers have over company-funded research supporting the safety and effectiveness of the drugs they make. Psaty said he accepts no funding from drug companies for his research, but short of having all clinical trials funded with public money, he suggests doctors look for red flags in studies that might indicate bias. ""Was the question a good question? Did they set the study up right? Did they use the weakest possible comparator to make a drug look good in a trial?"" he said. And when a medical journal editorial disagrees with the primary interpretation of the author, ""that is a potential marker of a study where there may been some bias from conflict of interest,"" he"

Investigations showed the late Wednesday night raid in an area of southeastern Khost had resulted in ""killing two males, two females and wounding two females. There are reports of an infant also killed,"" the military said in a statement. ""We deeply regret the tragic loss of life in this precious family,"" the late Thursday statement quoted Brigadier General Michael Ryan of the US forces as saying. ""Words alone cannot begin to express our regret and sympathy and we will ensure the surviving family members are properly cared for."" Civilian casualties caused by foreign forces hunting militants have sapped support for the presence of the troops in Afghanistan more than seven years since a US-led invasion overthrew the Taliban from power. The casualties have also been a major source of friction between the Afghan government and the West. The father of a seven-day-old boy said on Thursday his infant son died in the raid.

en.15.119.348.2009.4.16,Execution top killer of Iraqi civilians: study,"BAGHDAD, Thu Apr 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Executions by insurgents and death squads made up the biggest number of Iraqi civilian deaths in five years of war, while suicide bombers acting as ""smart bombs"" rivaled aerial bombs for deadliness, a study said. The study conducted by King's College and Royal Holloway of the University of London, and non-profit group Iraq Body Count, found that of 60,481 civilians killed between March 20, 2003, and March 19, 2008, 33 percent were abducted and executed. Of those executed in the study group, 29 percent bore marks of torture, such as bruises, drill holes or burns. The most deadly events for civilians involved aerial bombings, which would have been carried out primarily by US forces, and the combined use of ground weapons and aerial bombs, which both killed an average of 17 civilians per event. But suicide bombings by sectarian or insurgent groups were almost as bloody, killing an average of 16 people in each event. ""A suicide bomber on foot acts as a precision weapon - a close quarters 'smart bomb' whose pattern of killing many civilians at a time can result only from either disregard for civilians when targeting opposition forces or direct targeting of civilians,"" the report found. ""When combatant forces intentionally target civilians, they commit a war crime."" After executions, small-arms gunfire in firefights and open shootings accounted for 20 percent of civilian deaths and suicide bombs for 14 percent. Published in the April 16, 2009, issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, the study was based on a database of civilian deaths in Iraq maintained by www.iraqbodycount.org. The database contains data on up to 99,774 civilian deaths that occurred after the March 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein. Iraq Body Count says its figure underestimates the true number of casualties. The study excluded deaths that occurred during prolonged bouts of violence, such as long sieges by U.S. forces of insurgent-held areas, and deaths in which the type of weapon used was not reliably documented. The invasion triggered a ferocious insurgency and a wave of bloodshed between Iraq's once dominant Sunni Arab minority and its majority Shia Muslim population. More than 4,000 US troops have also died. The report's authors said their findings about aerial bombs and the large number of civilian casualties they caused per event showed their use should be prohibited in civilian areas to comply with international"
en.15.119.177.2009.4.15,US worker confidence in retirement hits new low,"NEW YORK, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The recession has driven confidence among U.S. workers in the prospect of a comfortable retirement to record lows, research showed on Tuesday. Only 13 percent of workers feel very confident they will have enough money for a comfortable retirement, the lowest level since the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a public policy research organization, began its annual study in 1993. Respondents blamed economic uncertainty, a drop in the value of their retirement savings, and increases in healthcare and day-to-day expenses for their lowered expectations, it said. Only a quarter of workers expect to have enough money to cover basic expenses in retirement, it said. Just 13 percent are very confident they can pay for medical expenses. Yet while workers are worrying, many remain poor planners, the study showed. Fewer than half, 44 percent, have tried to calculate how much they will need to have saved by the time they retire. The same number simply guess what they will need to be comfortable in retirement, it said. Those who knew the most about their own financial realities were most likely to lose confidence in their futures. Among workers who have calculated their retirement needs, the proportion calling themselves very confident dropped to 19 percent in 2009 from 29 percent the previous year. Confidence remained level among those who have done no calculation, at 8 percent in 2009 and 9 percent in 2008. Among those feeling less confident, 81 percent said they have cut expenses, 43 percent have changed the way they invest their money and 38 percent are working more hours or a second job, it said. ""In some ways the loss of confidence is a positive because confidence was leading people to not take the steps now that they have to take,"" said Mathew Greenwald, president of Mathew Greenwald & Associates, a Washington-based market research firm that co-sponsored the Retirement Confidence Survey.

en.15.119.136.2009.4.16,Obama envoy to Israel: US wants Palestinian state,"JERUSALEM, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President Barack Obama's Middle East envoy told Israel's ultranationalist foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, Thursday that Washington wants to see the creation of a Palestinian state. ""I reiterated to the foreign minister that U.S. policy favors, with respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a two-state solution which will have a Palestinian state living in peace alongside the Jewish state of Israel,"" envoy George Mitchell told reporters, with Lieberman at his side. ""We look forward also to efforts to achieving comprehensive peace throughout the region,"" Mitchell said. Lieberman has rejected restarting statehood negotiations with the Palestinians that were launched by then-US President George W. Bush at a conference in Annapolis, Maryland in 2007. In his comments to reporters, Lieberman made no mention of a Palestinian state, an issue that could put Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-leaning government on a collision course with Obama. ""It was a great opportunity to exchange some ideas, and we spoke about really close cooperation,"" Lieberman said about his meeting with Mitchell. Mitchell, a former U.S. senator who mediated in the Northern Ireland peace process, planned to hold talks later in the day with Netanyahu and see Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Friday. Netanyahu has so far refused to commit himself to the establishment of a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. He has said he wants to focus any future peace negotiations with the Palestinians on economic and security matters, rather than thorny issues such as statehood borders, and the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees. Mitchell said that Lieberman told him about Israel's desire to ""make economic improvements"" in the West Bank. Palestinian leaders have rejected any notion of an ""economic peace"" and have said U.S.-backed talks with Israel could not resume until Netanyahu committed to statehood. Mitchell is on his first visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories since Netanyahu's government was inaugurated on March 31"

Bangladesh were drawn in Group A along with Myanmar, Cambodia and Macao, the team on Wednesday moved into the qualifiers with a 3-3 aggregate after going 1-3 down away to hosts Mongolia. Macao had earlier beaten Mongolia 2-0 at home. The Bangladesh Football Federation also on Wednesday announced a 20-member squad for the warm-up match keeping strikers Jahid Hasan Emily, Mohammad Robin and winger Jahid Hasan, defender Ariful Islam and third-choice goalkeeper Mazharul Islam Himel. ""Emily, Robin and Jahid had been suffering from different injuries while Ariful and Himel did not make much progress in the training camp,"" new BFF general secretary Al Musabbir Sadi quoted Brazilian coach Edson Silva as saying. The absence of strike duo Emily and Robin means Bangladesh have to reply on new pairing of Mithun Chowdhury and Enamul Haq. As many as 25 players started to practice under the supervision of Dido and Argentine trainer Ariel Colman since May 28, a day after the Citycell Super Cup final. ""The progress has not been great and the time I got is not enough when you want to change the game completely,"" Dido said. ""However, the players had started to realise what I wanted from them."" Though Bangladesh will be playing the matches of the AFC Challenge Cup at home, the National Team Management Committee, led by vice-president Badal Roy, has arranged a warm-up match abroad as recommended by the national coach. Explaining the reason behind playing a practice match aboard, Dido said it would act as a physiological boost because it would be tough to recover from a setback if the boys went down at home, but a loss aboard would not affect the players much. Bangladesh will play Nepal Police on April 18 after having just a day's practice in Kathmandu, which is situated 1,336 metres (4,383 feet) above sea level. ""I don't know much about the opponents and I can't say you whether we are going to win or lose. It depends on how much the players can cope with the conditions,"" Dido was quoted as saying. Squad: Aminul Haq (captain), Biplob Bhattacharya, Nasirul Islam Nasir, Wali Faisal, Atiqur Rahman Mishu, Rashedul Islam Rashed, Rajani Kanta Barman, M Sujan, Moffazal Hossain Saikat, Mamun Mia, Arman Aziz, Enamul Haq Sharif, Pranotosh Kumar, Mejbabur Haq Manik, Jahed Parvez Chowdhury, Mamunul Islam Mamun, Motiur Munna, Iman Ahmed, Enamul Haq and Mithun Chowdhury.

en.15.119.245.2009.4.14,Little leverage left for North Korea sanctions,"BEIJING, Tue Apr 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Strengthened sanctions are unlikely to dent North Korea's trade with benefactor China, but the global slowdown is taking its own toll on the isolated North, which said on Tuesday it will abandon nuclear talks. North Korea's announcement that it will abandon the ""useless"" six-party disarmament talks and restart a nuclear plant followed the UN Security Council's condemnation on Monday of its rocket launch nearly two weeks ago. The security council demanded enforcement of existing sanctions. Lower commodity prices may prove more painful to North Korea than the tightened sanctions, which will likely blacklist certain firms known to deal in military goods. ""Sanctions won't have a big effect, they won't change their actions,"" said Shi Jinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. ""There will be no impact on trade with China, which is mostly grains and basic materials ... Sanctions may have some influence on luxury goods, but only a weak effect on overall trade volume."" The isolated country's $2 billion annual trade with China, equal to about 10 percent of the North's annual GDP, is its most important economic relationship. China repeatedly urged restraint as North Korea prepared its rocket launch. But it was reluctant to take a harder stand for fear of losing influence in Pyongyang and due to worries about the major political and economic risks if North Korea collapsed. Trade between the two countries has slipped in recent months, as a plunge in metals prices closed one of North Korea's few channels of export revenues. The value of trade between the two countries dropped 3 percent in the first two months of 2009. North Korea profited from strong prices for minerals and ores over the last few years, ramping up exports of zinc, lead and iron ore to resource-hungry China. Most of those exports have dropped again since last summer, in line with sharp decreases in metals prices buffeted by the global economic crisis. For a graphic, click: (http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/apr09/NKR_MNRLS0409.jpg) The North's mineral deposits could be worth $2 trillion, according to an estimate by the South's Korea Resources Corporation. But dilapidated infrastructure and a broken power grid hinder mining and the transport of minerals out of the country. The irregular pattern of North Korea's alumina imports implies that its smelter only runs in fits and starts. Other ore exports are equally ragged, possibly indicating that North Koreans are only digging the easily accessible ores. Chinese companies that have tried to invest in North Korean mines complain of constant changes in regulations and report that the North tries to tie mining access to commitments to build mills and other industrial projects. ""China and North Korea are friendly neighbors and we will continue to develop friendly cooperative relations with North Korea,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said on Tuesday after the North's withdrawal from the six-party talks. TESTY TRADE Diplomats' expectations that China might use trade to influence its prickly neighbor rose when China cut off crude oil shipments in September of 2006, as North Korea prepared to test a nuclear bomb. It had tested ballistic missiles that July. In fact, energy trade data shows that China is reluctant to apply trade pressure. Increased oil products shipments offset the brief cut in crude supplies in 2006. ""The imposition of these sanctions (in 2006) has had no perceptible effect on North Korea's trade with the country's two largest partners, China and South Korea,"" wrote Marcus Noland, of the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics. Data since early 2006 show that Chinese crude shipments have in fact been overwhelmingly consistent, at 50,000 tons a month. For a graphic, click: (http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/apr09/NKR_OILIM0409.jpg) But imports of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), normally used as a cooking fuel in Asia, have plummeted since August 2007. Aid agencies have said when North Korea stirs global tensions it is more difficult for them to receive food pledges for the impoverished state, where handouts account for about one-fifth of food supplies. Nonetheless, the United States provided 500,000 tons of rice after South Korea cut off food aid. But it was slow to provide fertilizer, which could harm agricultural output again in 2009 after better weather brought an improved harvest in 2008. North Korea has imported very little Chinese grain since the 2008 harvest, reflecting the better harvest. Flooding and a disastrous harvest in 2006 and 2007 required heavy imports of grains from China in those years. Chinese corn shipments to North Korea since August have dropped to 2,670 tons, from 136,595 tons in the previous twelve months and 32,186 tons in the year before that. Rice and soybean shipments show a similar pat"
en.15.119.422.2009.4.10,Battered Bayern's title defence on the line,"BERLIN, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Having shipped nine goals in two games, Bayern Munich have little time to wallow in self-pity when they host Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Saturday. After a 5-1 drubbing at the hands of league leaders VfL Wolfsburg last week, Bayern were thrashed 4-0 by Barcelona in their Champions League quarter-final first leg on Wednesday. With their leaky defence a shadow of last season's solid backline and defender Lucio as well as striker Miroslav Klose injured, coach Juergen Klinsmann needs a quick fix. Defending champions Bayern are three points off the top in third place with 48 points with eight games remaining this term. Klinsmann must also deal with mounting criticism that his first season in charge of Bayern has been a flop, despite vocal backing from the club board. Bayern playmaker Franck Ribery admitted they needed to win against Eintracht to keep any title hopes alive. ""We are under pressure now. We absolutely must win against Frankfurt,"" the Frenchman said after Bayern's mauling in Spain. ""We have to be present at the weekend."" However, catching Wolfsburg, especially given Bayern's erratic recent performances, is no easy task, with Felix Magath's team having won their last eight league matches. IN-FORM STRIKERS Wolfsburg, who lead Hamburg on goal difference in the Bundesliga, travel to lowly Borussia Moenchengladbach with two of the league's most dangerous strikers in Grafite and Edin Dzeko. The pair have been superb throughout the season, with the Brazilian topping the scorers' list with 20 goals and the Bosnian 15. While Magath has banned any title talk, insisting their aim was to finish in the top five, the players know the championship is only a few more wins away. ""Glabach will fight against relegation in this match and they will need every point they can get,"" Wolfsburg midfielder Zvjezdan Misimovic said. ""But if we keep a cool head we can get something out of this match as well."" Hamburg, also on 51 points, travel to resurgent Stuttgart, who are in fifth place. Hamburg's midweek UEFA Cup clash against Manchester City could leave Martin Jol's side drained, however, the team having played virtually non-stop since the end of the winter break in the league, UEFA Cup and German Cup"

Former champions Gremio booked their place in the last 16 with a 2-0 win away to Universidad de Chile and Brazilian champions Sao Paulo, already qualified, lost 2-1 away to Independiente Medellin. Vanderlei Luxemburgo's Palmeiras were gifted an early lead in their all-Brazilian Group One match in Sao Paulo when they were awarded a penalty for handball after Pablo Armero's cross appeared to hit Sport defender Cesar Lucena in the chest. Keirrison converted in the 15th minute. Wilson equalised in first-half injury-time but then lifted up his shirt as he celebrated and was sent off for a second bookable offence. Palmeiras pressed throughout the second half but were unable to force a winner. Colo Colo and Sport have seven points from four games while Palmeiras and defending champions LDU have four apiece. Former Brazil and Real Madrid coach Luxemburgo has won the Brazilian championship five times but the more prestigious Libertadores has eluded him. Twice former champions Gremio made sure of a top-two finish in Group Seven with their win in Santiago. Leo headed them in front from a rebound after Jonas' header hit the crossbar in the 31st minute and former Barcelona and Real Madrid striker Maxi Lopez latched on to Souza's perfectly-timed pass to slot in the second in the 62nd minute. Universidad de Chile, second in the group with seven points from five games, had striker Juan Manuel Olivera sent off for an off-the-ball incident as they dropped six behind Gremio. Independiente Medellin, who drew their first four games in Group Seven, boosted their chances as their win over Sao Paulo took them second with seven points.

""About half the injuries were reported as serious,"" said Tommy Jackson, a spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management at North Little Rock, Arkansas. Mena, with a population of 5,600, is the seat of Polk County, on the Arkansas border with Oklahoma, and is about 130 miles west of Little Rock, the state capitol. The storm roared through the small town shortly after 8 p.m. CST on Thursday night (0100 GMT on Friday morning). Damage but no death was reported in several smaller, nearby communities. The number of homes damaged or destroyed had yet to be determined, Jackson said. But he said there was extensive damage to the Polk County courthouse and municipal buildings, and to the downtown business area. Shelters were set up in two Mena churches for the displaced. Governor Mike Beebe dispatched 30 National Guardsmen to the town to assist local officials in providing security. Entergy, the state's primary electricity provider, said more than 10,000 customers were without power in three counties closer to central Arkansas because of damage to lines from high winds.

Many financial centers in the region were closed for a long weekend, making investors nervous that gains made now may not be sustained next week when many major U.S. companies report quarterly earnings. The Nikkei hit a three-month closing high for the second day in a row, though off the day's peak reached above the psychologically key 9,000 level, as banks tumbled after Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) warned of a net loss for the financial year just ended, reviving fears for other megabanks. Nikkei .N225 edged up 0.5 percent to 8,964.11. U.S. shares rebounded after Wells Fargo (WFC.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) said it expected to post a record quarterly profit of $3 billion, topping analyst expectations that sent the sector -- key to market sentiment -- sharply higher, with the S&P financial index .GSPF soaring 15.51 percent. In Taiwan, this dovetailed with Cathay Financial (2882.TW: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) rallying after it reversed a year-ago loss to report market-beating first quarter profits, helping shares hit a 6-month high. Taiwan's main TAIEX share index .TWII gained 2 percent to 5,781.96, while the Korea Composite Stock Price Index .KS11 (KOSPI) rose 1.5 percent to 1,336.04.

""The market was helped by Wells Fargo's stronger than expected first quarter results estimate, fueling hopes of stabilization in U.S. financial markets,"" said Won Jong-hyuck, a market analyst at SK Securities in Seoul. Global investors have been keenly awaiting U.S. financial results, which move into high gear next week when Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup are all set to report.

en.15.119.116.2009.4.10,Fiji president takes over,"SUVA, Fri Apr 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fiji's president revoked the politically unstable South Pacific nation's constitution on Friday, named himself to temporarily replace a post-coup interim government and called for fresh elections by 2014. President Ratu Josefa Iloilo said he would soon appoint a new interim government but gave no firm time-frame. His actions come after an administration headed by military commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama since a bloodless December 2006 coup was declared illegal by Fiji's Court of Appeal on Thursday. Fiji has suffered four coups and a bloody military mutiny since 1987, mainly as a result of tensions between the majority indigenous Fijian population and the economically powerful ethnic Indian minority. Iloilo's plans will likely further harm Fiji's international relations, already strained after Bainimarama went back on a promise to hold elections in the first quarter of 2009. Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 mainly former British colonies, after Bainimarama's 2006 coup. The United States and European Union imposed sanctions until the tourism- and sugar-reliant island nation held elections. Bainimarama says Fiji must first change its racially based electoral system, which he blames for past instability. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier this week urged Bainimarama to restore democracy, backing a demand by South Pacific leaders for elections this year. Australia and New Zealand, Fiji's main trading partners and biggest aid donors, have refused entry to any member of the Fiji military, government and their families since the 2006 coup. Australia condemned Iloilo's decision to abrogate the constitution and backed the appeal court's ruling, which included a recommendation for prompt elections. ""This is the right course for Fiji and the only way forward for the people of Fiji,"" Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said in a statement on Friday. ELECTIONS BY 2014 Fiji should hold fresh elections by 2014, Iloilo said in a national broadcast from his presidential residence set in sprawling grounds overlooking the harbor in the capital, Suva. ""I am sure you will all work together with me and the soon-to-be appointed interim government to ensure that this transition to a new legal order is not only smooth but will reap many benefits for us and the future generations and resolve many of our long outstanding and systematic problems,"" the aging and ailing Iloilo said. Iloilo appointed Bainimarama prime minister after the military leader toppled former premier Laisenia Qarase, who he accused of corruption and being soft on the leaders of another coup in 2000. Iloilo's election timetable and call for electoral reforms mirror those of Bainimarama, whom he is known to favor. ""It has brought about reforms. It has created opportunities for new ideas. It has adhered to my mandate,"" Iloilo said of Bainimarama's government. ""It has had a positive impact on the lives of our people in particular the ordinary citizens of our country, including those in the rural areas,"" he said. Qarase had asked the court of appeal to overturn an earlier High Court ruling that Bainimarama's government was legal. Iloilo sacked three judges involved in Thursday's ru"

The statement from the United States, Britain, Japan and Norway came as Sri Lanka's military said it had begun what it called ""the largest hostage rescue operation in the world"" by identifying the best routes for people to get out. The four-nation group, dubbed the Tokyo Co-Chairs, discussed on a conference call ""how to best end the futile fighting without further bloodshed,"" a US State Department statement said. ""They call on the Tamil Tigers to permit freedom of movement for the civilians in the area,"" it said. ""They reaffirmed the need to stop shelling into the 'no fire zone' to prevent further civilian casualties."" Tens of thousands of civilians are trapped inside a 17 square km (7 sq mile) army-declared no-fire zone on the northeastern coast, held there by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and being killed in shelling, the co-chairs' statement said. It is on that piece of land where the final act of Sri Lanka's 25-year civil war is expected to play out, and diplomats have been working furiously to negotiate an exit for the people stuck there but have been repeatedly rebuffed by the LTTE. The government has vowed no ceasefire but pledged to stop fighting briefly to let people out as it has done in the past. At least 64,000 people have fled since January. President Mahinda Rajapaksa spoke with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon late on Thursday, and assured him that ""Sri Lanka was aware of and observes all international obligations to protect civilians,"" a statement from the president's office said. ""HOSTAGE RESCUE"" The Defense Ministry said troops had begun ""the world's biggest hostage rescue operation"" and that the 58th Division, which has won several major recent victories, would spearhead it. Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said troops were within a few hundred meters of the no-fire zone and broadcasting messages advising people the best routes of escape. ""No shelling is going on and up to now about 300 people have come today. There are people coming in now, but then the LTTE had come and assaulted some of them, we were able to see,"" he said. Pro-rebel website www.TamilNet.com said this week hundreds have been killed by shelling in recent days, while Human Rights Watch in a statement on Friday reiterated its charge that the government was shelling the no-fire zone. ""Sri Lanka's so-called 'no-fire zone' is now one of the most dangerous places in the world,"" Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. Sri Lanka has repeatedly accused the group of inaccurate and biased reporting. Diplomats say they fear thousands could die if the LTTE and government cannot cut a deal to free them, either getting killed in combat in the densely packed area or dying in a mass killing orchestrated by the Tigers to be blamed on the military. The latter, diplomats say, would help the LTTE energize their diaspora while hurting the government by damaging ties with western governments who may be forced to cut off aid. The LTTE has vowed economic sabotage against the state, which is seeking a $1.9 billion loan to help solve a balance of payments crisis while struggling with downward pressure on the rupee currency and shrinking export earn"

""Even a couple of years back, broad gauge trains coming into Kamalapur station was unthinkable,"" Md Belayet Hossain, the railway's director general told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. The people of Rajshahi have had to wait 147 years, since the introduction of railway in Bengal by the British in 1862, to reach Dhaka direct. The Bangla New Year has come to have a special significance for Bangladesh Railway. Last year on this day, the Maitree Express, the first direct passenger train service between Dhaka and Kolkata in over 40 years, made its first journey. Last New Year also saw broad gauge trains from northern Rajshahi and southwestern Khulna reach the Cantonment Station, still some 11 kilometres off the city centre, for the first time. This year, the Silk City Express chugged direct into the city centre at 1.30pm with 529 passengers on board. Communications minister Syed Abdul Hossain formally inaugurated the new service at Kamalapur Station, while crowds of onlookers and railway officials greeted the passengers. The train left again for Rajshahi at 2.40pm. However, most trains from Rajshahi and Khulna divisions, the Railway's West Zone, still cannot make it to Kamalapur Station owing to difference in gauge. The West Zone runs on broad gauge lines while East Zone, comprising Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet divisions, run on narrow metre gauge lines. Since 2000, the authorities turned Dhaka's metre gauge into dual gauge making it fit for the movement of both metre and broad gauge trains. An additional director general TA Chowdhury said operating from Kamalapur station would reduce the hassle of getting transport into the city proper. ""Passengers find it difficult to get taxis or buses at the station owing to its location,"" he told bdnews24.com. Quazi Asadullah Another director general of the railway said by June-July all broad gauge trains coming from Rajshahi and Khulna would come to Kamalapur after the completion of signalling works. ""At present, only the Silk City will ply between Rajashahi and Kamalapur,"" he told bdnews24.com. Railway officials say one of the major problems was the national railway network was not originally centred around Dhaka. The British rulers set up the railways in Bengal with all lines concentrated around the Indian city of Kolkata, the capital of the then undivided Bengal. The rail network remained relatively unchanged up to the late 1990s. Since then successive governments finally took initiatives to rehaul the rail system to serve Dhaka better."

The request, in the form of a complaint seeking declaratory relief, cites an ongoing intellectual property dispute between Yahoo and Quigo, an online advertising company that AOL acquired for $340 million in 2007. According to the complaint, attorneys for Yahoo have alleged in emails and letters sent over the past several years to AOL and Quigo that up to seven Yahoo patents are being infringed. ""The parties' attempts to negotiate a settlement of the Yahoo defendants' patent infringement claims over several months until March 26, 2009, have been unsuccessful,"" read the complaint, filed on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. AOL spokeswoman Allie Burns said the company does not comment on pending litigation. Representatives for Yahoo were not immediately available for comment. AOL and Yahoo were in discussions about a potential combination last year, following Microsoft Corp's failed $47.5 billion bid to acquire Yahoo. Yahoo Chief Executive Carol Bartz, who took the reins in January, recently met with Microsoft to discuss a partnership involving their search advertising business, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity"

On-duty police said the violence ensued as two groups of workers brought out processions to join a rally to be addressed by a local MP. Witnesses said the two groups of Ghat Sramik League attacked each other with sticks and bricks, bringing all activities around the ferry station to a stand still. The three-hour hostilities were marked by chases and counter chases between the two sides, they said. Internal conflicts within the Ghat Sramik League have been mounting in recent months centering on establishing supremacy over the ghat area. Ghat worker 'Faiz' told bdnews24.com that two groups, ""one led by Ghat Sramik League president Jalil Hawladar and the other led by Kanchan Munshi who wants to oust Jalil"", were fighting for control. Kotwali police said that no one had come to register a case over the clashes, and the situation was brought under control by evening. The injured workers were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital, they said. b"
en.15.119.265.2009.4.10,Pirates with US hostage vow to fight if attacked,"MOGADISHU, Fri Apr 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somali pirates holding an Ameican hostage on a drifting lifeboat vowed on Friday to fight any attack by US naval forces stalking them at high sea. ""We are not afraid of the Americans,"" one of the pirates told Reuters by satellite phone on behalf of the gang holding ship captain Richard Phillips in the Indian Ocean. ""We will defend ourselves if attacked."" Despite their defiant talk, maritime groups tracking the saga -- the first time Somali pirates have captured an American -- say a more likely outcome is a negotiated solution, possibly involving safe passage in exchange for their captive. Four pirates have been holding Phillips, a former Boston taxi driver, since Wednesday after a foiled bid to hijack the 17,000-tonne Maersk Alabama several hundred miles off Somalia. The ship's lifeboat has run out of fuel, other pirates are too nervous to help them due to the presence of foreign naval ships, and the USS Bainbridge destroyer is up close. ""Other pirates want to come and help their friends, but that would be like sentencing themselves to death,"" said Andrew Mwangura, coordinator of the East African Seafarers' Assistance Programme that monitors the region's seas. ""They will release the captain, I think, maybe today or tomorrow, but in exchange for something. Maybe some payment or compensation, and definitely free passage back home."" Phillips is one of about 270 hostages being held at the moment by Somali pirates, who have been plying the busy sea-lanes of the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean for years. They are keeping 18 captured vessels at or near lairs on the Somali coast -- five of them taken since the weekend alone. Yet the fact Phillips is the first U.S. citizen seized, and the drama of his 20-man American crew stopping the Alabama being hijacked on Wednesday, has galvanised world attention. It has also given President Barack Obama another foreign policy problem in a place most Americans would rather forget. Perched on the Horn of Africa across from the Middle East, Somalia has suffered 18 years of civil conflict since warlords toppled former dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Americans remember with a shudder the disastrous U.S.-U.N. intervention there soon after, including the infamous ""Black Hawk Down"" battle in 1993 when 18 U.S. troops were killed in a 17-hour firefight that later inspired a book and a movie. US SENDS MORE SHIPS In another Somali-American saga, Captain Phillips apparently volunteered to get in the lifeboat with the pirates on Wednesday to act as a hostage for the sake of the Alabama's 20 American crew members, who somehow retook control of their ship. The freighter, which is carrying food aid for Uganda and Somalia, is now on its way to its original destination, Mombasa port in Kenya. It is expected to arrive by Sunday night. Pirate sources in Somalia told Reuters they had sent two boats full of armed men to help their colleagues on the lifeboat. The two boats were staying far apart, to help evade patrols, but were nervous of approaching due to the naval ships. The USS Bainbridge has called on the FBI and other US officials to help negotiate with the pirates. US military officials said more forces were on the way and that all options were on the table to save the captain. ""We're definitely sending more ships down to the area,"" a defence official told Reuters. He said one of the ships would be the USS Halyburton, a guided missile frigate that has two helicopters on board. Last year saw an unprecedented number of hijackings off Somalia -- 42 in total. That disrupted shipping, delayed food aid to east Africa, increased insurance costs, and persuaded some firms to send cargoes round South Africa instead of through the Suez Canal, a critical route for oil. It also brought a massive international response, with ships from the United States, Europe, China, Japan and others flocking to the region to protect the sea-routes. As the patrols mainly focused on the Gulf of Aden, the gateway to the Suez, the pirates began moving further afield and have been striking as far south as Indian Ocean waters near the Seychelles and Madagascar. Analysts say the attack on the Alabama could lead to a new phase in international efforts to stop piracy. ""Piracy may be a centuries-old crime, but we are working to bring an appropriate, 21st-century response,"" US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said. With a vast area for the pirates to roam in, however, analysts say the only real solution is peace and stable government in Somalia it"
en.15.119.186.2009.4.14,Murky origins of Iraq attacks stir foreboding,"BAGHDAD, Tue Apr 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A series of bombings and clashes between Sunni militias and Shia-led government forces have stirred a sense of foreboding in Iraq ahead of a national election and the withdrawal of US troops. Violence in Iraq remains sharply down on past years, when most attacks were blamed on al Qaeda or Shia militias, but uncertainty about the origins of the recent violence has led to an incendiary mix of conspiracy theories and accusations. Many fear too much emphasis has been placed on grooming Iraq's security forces and too little on forging political compromise between ethnic and sectarian groups. ""The political parties are the cause, and the solution, but it's the ordinary citizen trying to make a living who has paid the price,"" said Saad Abu Haider, sitting in a Baghdad park. A spate of bombings in Baghdad last week included an apparently coordinated series of seven blasts that killed 37 people. In the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on Friday, a truck bomb was the deadliest attack for US forces in over a year. On Saturday a suicide bomber killed 12 US-backed Sunni militiamen south of Baghdad as they collected paychecks. The bombings occurred just after clashes between one of the Sunni militias -- set up to fight al Qaeda -- and Iraqi forces aiming to arrest one of the militia's leaders in Baghdad. Analysts say there is a mistaken focus on the readiness of Iraq's security forces to take over from the US military, whose combat troops are due to leave Iraq by Aug. 31 next year, when a peaceful future for Iraq depends as much on efforts to seek a viable political framework. ""The level of military progress in Iraq has sometimes led to dangerous illusions about its stability and the level of violence that it will endure until it can achieve a far more stable level of political accommodation,"" said Anthony Cordesman of Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. BAATHISTS AND SUNNIS? The government blames the violence on Saddam Hussein's Baath party, which last week marked 62 years since its foundation in Syria. Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, its most senior leader at large, made a rare statement urging attacks on Iraqi and US forces. Last week was also the anniversary of the fall of Baghdad to invading US troops six years ago. ""It's about the Baath party. They're trying to show they're still a force in Iraq,"" said labourer Ahmed al-Saadoun. The government said the mostly Sunni Baathists were aided by Sunni Islamist al Qaeda, which analysts say may also be exploiting tensions between the government and ethnic Kurds. Two recent truck bombs in Mosul in the north, where Kurds and Arabs dispute territory, carried the group's hallmarks. In Baghdad, analysts say, some members of Sunni militias formed in 2006 with US backing to battle al Qaeda may be re-evaluating their stance after Iraqi forces arrested some members, who include many former insurgents. ""What we're seeing may be a tentative Sunni pushback against what some Sunnis see as a threatening consolidation of power by Maliki without adequate safeguards for them,"" said Stephen Biddle, of Washington's Council on Foreign Relations thinktank. INTRA-SHI'ITE RIVALRY? Some also worry about intra-Shi'ite rivalry. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a Shia, made huge gains in January's local elections with a law and order platform and largely non-sectarian message, winning seats at the expense of religious incumbents, the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council (ISCI). Some may want to undermine Maliki's claim to have improved security, and oppose his attempts to forge alliances with Sunnis and others ahead of a parliamentary election due in December. ""Maliki won in the polls for providing security and the violence has increased since then to ruin his reputation. It's political, and there are countries that do not want Iraq to be secure who have a hand in it,"" said shop worker Hashim Majid. References in Iraq to meddlesome countries are often aimed at Iran which has close links to Iraq's Shi'ite factions because that was where they fled when Shi'ites were repressed by Saddam. ISCI, founded in Tehran in the 1980s, overtly invoked Shia religious belief and ritual in elections in 2005. ""It is fairly clear ISCI has been at the forefront of the attempt since February to derail tendencies of cross-sectarian alliance-building ... Both ISCI and Iran seem to favour the logic that prevailed in the 2005 elections,"" said analyst Reidar Visser of www.historiae.org. ISCI did not respond to requests for com"
en.15.119.313.2009.4.15,Afghanistan fears Swat deal may harm its security,"KABUL, Apr 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan said on Tuesday it was concerned its own security could be hurt by a deal between Pakistan and Taliban guerrillas to impose Islamic law on a Pakistani valley. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari signed a regulation on Monday imposing sharia on Swat, a picturesque valley in northwest Pakistan, as part of a deal to end violence from the strict Islamist guerrillas. But Afghanistan, fighting its own insurgency against the Taliban, has long worried that success by the Taliban in Pakistan could embolden the militants on both sides of the border. ""Since any deal with terrorist groups can have effects on the security of our own country and people, we ask the country of Pakistan to take into consideration the issue of security and its side-effects on relations between the two countries,"" Afghan presidential spokesman Humayun Hamidzada told a news briefing. The strict Islamist Taliban, with roots in ethnic Pashtun tribes that straddle the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, have been waging insurgencies in both countries. Afghanistan has in the past accused Pakistani security forces of tacitly supporting militants who infiltrate across the border into Afghanistan, an accusation that has soured ties between the two key allies of Washington. Afghanistan has seen a surge of attacks by Taliban in recent years, the bloodiest period since US-backed Afghan forces drove the militants from Kabul in 2001. It has repeatedly said that most of the attacks are organised in Pakistan where the Taliban have havens in lawless tribal areas close to the Afghan border. Meanwhile, Taliban influence has been spreading through the northwest of Pakistan, reviving concerns about the stability of the nuclear-armed state. Pakistani authorities accepted an Islamist demand for sharia in Swat to end more than a year of fighting, but critics said appeasement would only embolden the milit"

en.15.119.417.2009.4.13,US Navy rescues captain and kills Somali pirates,"Mogadishu, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US Navy shot dead three Somali pirates and rescued cargo ship captain Richard Phillips on Sunday from a lifeboat off the coast of Somalia where he was being held captive, ending a five-day standoff. Phillips' life was in danger when Navy snipers aboard a nearby U.S. destroyer shot his Somali captors, freeing him unharmed and killing three of the four pirates who had held him after trying to seize his vessel, the Navy said. The fourth pirate was in custody. ""I can tell you that he is free and that he is safe,"" said Navy Lieutenant Commander John Daniels. A U.S. Navy commander made a split-second decision to fire on the pirates because he believed that Phillips, who tried to escape on Friday, faced imminent danger amid tense hostage talks with his captors and deteriorating sea conditions. ""They were pointing the AK-47s at the captain,"" Vice Admiral William Gortney, head of the U.S. Naval Central Command, said in a Pentagon briefing from Bahrain. ""The on-scene commander took it as the captain was in imminent danger and then made that decision (to kill the pirates) and he had the authorities to make that decision and he had seconds to make that decision."" President Barack Obama granted the Pentagon's request for standing authority to use appropriate force to save the life of the captain, Gortney said. The U.S. Navy 5th Fleet in Bahrain said the rescue took place at 12:19 p.m. EDT (1619 GMT) and the lifeboat had drifted to about 20 miles from lawless Somalia's coast. Phillips, captain of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama container ship, had contacted his family, received a routine medical evaluation, and was resting comfortably aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer. ""We are all absolutely thrilled to learn that Richard is safe and will be reunited with his family,"" said Maersk Line chief executive John Reinhart. A smiling Phillips was shown in a picture released by the U.S. Navy after his rescue. Phillips' crew set off flares, hoisted an American flag and jumped for joy at the news of their captain's rescue. ""We are very happy. He's a hero,"" one crew member of the Maersk Alabama shouted at journalists amid raucous celebrations on the deck of the vessel, docked in Kenya's Mombasa port. Phillips, 53, was the first American taken captive by Somali pirate gangs who have marauded in the busy Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean shipping lanes for years. Three U.S. warships were watching the situation. PIRATES VOW REVENGE Obama, spared from having another thorny foreign policy crisis added to his troubles with the U.S. economic meltdown and the war in Afghanistan, welcomed the rescue, praised the U.S. military and vowed to curb rampant piracy. ""To achieve that goal, we must continue to work with our partners to prevent future attacks, be prepared to interdict acts of piracy and ensure that those who commit acts of piracy are held accountable for their crimes,"" he said in a statement. The White House issued a time line that showed Obama received frequent updates on the crisis and on Friday and Saturday gave the Pentagon policy guidance authorities to allow U.S. forces to take emergency actions. Somali pirates were quick to vow revenge over the shooting of their comrades, as well as a French military assault to rescue a yacht on Friday. ""The French and the Americans will regret starting this killing. We do not kill, but take only ransom. We shall do something to anyone we see as French or American from now,"" Hussein, a pirate, told Reuters by satellite phone. The Maersk Alabama, a container ship carrying food aid for Somalis, was attacked far out in the Indian Ocean on Wednesday, but its 20 American crew apparently fought off the pirates and regained control. Phillips volunteered to go with the pirates in a Maersk Alabama lifeboat in exchange for the crew, said Vice AdmiralBill Gortney, commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command. ""The actions of Captain Phillips and the civilian mariners of Maersk-Alabama were heroic. They fought back to regain control of their ship, and Captain Phillips selflessly put his life in the hands of these armed criminals in order to protect his crew,"" he said in a statement. Joseph Murphy, whose son, Shane, was Phillips's second in command and took over the Alabama after pirates left with Phillips, said in a statement read by CNN, ""Our prayers have been answered on this Easter Sunday."" ""My son and our family will forever be indebted to Capt. Phillips for his bravery. If not for his incredible personal sacrifice, this kidnapping -- an act of terror -- could have turned out much worse."" ""The captain is a hero,"" one crew member shouted from the 17,000-ton ship as it docked in Kenya's Mombasa port under darkness on Saturday. ""He saved our lives by giving himself up."" MORE VIOLENCE FEARED Experts had expected a quick end to the standoff, but the pirates held out for both a ransom and safe passage home. Friends told Reuters the gang wanted $2 million. The saga has drawn world attention to the long-running piracy problem off Somalia that has pushed up shipping insurance costs and disrupted international trade. Andrew Mwangura, coordinator of Mombasa-based East African Seafarers Assistance Program, said the rescue would change the stakes in future pirate attacks. ""This is a big wake-up to the pirates. It raises the stakes. Now they may be more violent, like the pirates of old,"" he said. So far, pirates have generally treated hostages well, sometimes roasting goat meat for them and even passing phones round so they can call loved ones. The worst violence reported has been the occasional beating and no hostages are known to have been killed by pirates. ""This could escalate violence in this part of the world -- no question about it,"" said Gortney. The U.S. Justice Department said in a statement it ""will be reviewing the evidence and other issues to determine whether to seek prosecution in the United States."""
en.15.119.215.2009.4.13,Unapproved liquid morphine can still be sold in US: FDA,"WASHINGTON, Mon Apr 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Companies marketing a liquid morphine that was unapproved for sale in the United States can keep selling it for now because regulators have determined it is essential for relieving pain in some patients who are near death. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which recently told the companies to stop marketing the product here, said it was reversing course after discussions with groups that provide end-of-life care. Advocates said the morphine elixir, sold in a potent 20-milligram per milliliter strength, was the only pain relief option for some dying patients. On March 30, the FDA sent letters to nine companies telling them to stop selling 14 unapproved narcotic pain medicines as part of an effort to rid the market of drugs that do not have proper clearance. The companies were given 60 days to stop making them. Seven of those companies make or distribute the liquid morphine that is used for some dying patients. On Thursday, the FDA sent new letters to the makers or distributors of the liquid morphine telling them sales could continue for now, according to Douglas Throckmorton, deputy director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Sales of unapproved versions will have to stop after an acceptable liquid morphine wins approval or when the FDA determines that appropriate alternatives are available, Throckmorton told reporters. Makers of the morphine solution include Glenmark Generics, a unit of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals; Lannett Company, and Covidien Ltd unit Mallinckrodt, according to information on the FDA's web"

en.15.119.28.2009.4.12,Microsoft sees end of Windows era: report,"Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com) - Microsoft has kicked off a research project to create software that will take over when it retires Windows, reports BBC News. Called Midori, the cut-down operating system is radically different to Microsoft's older programmes. It is centred on the internet and does away with the dependencies that tie Windows to a single PC. It is seen as Microsoft's answer to rivals' use of ""virtualisation"" as a way to solve many of the problems of modern-day computing. Tie breaking Although Midori has been heard about before now, more details have now been published by Software Development Times after viewing internal Microsoft documents describing the technology. Midori is believed to be under development because Windows is unlikely to be able to cope with the pace of change in future technology and the way people use it. Windows worked well in an age when most people used one machine to do all their work. The operating system acted as the holder for the common elements Windows programs needed to call on. ""If you think about how an operating system is loaded,"" said Dave Austin, European director of products at Citrix, ""it's loaded onto a hard disk physically located on that machine. ""The operating system is tied very tightly to that hardware,"" he said. That, he said, created all kinds of dependencies that arose out of the collection of hardware in a particular machine. This means, he said, that Windows can struggle with more modern ways of working in which people are very mobile and very promiscuous in the devices they use to get at their data - be that pictures, spreadsheets or e-mail. Equally, he said, when people worked or played now, they did it using a combination of data and processes held locally or in any of a number of other places online. When asked about Midori by BBC News, Microsoft issued a statement that said: ""Midori is one of many incubation projects underway at Microsoft. It's simply a matter of being too early in the incubation to talk about it."" Virtual machines Midori is widely seen as an ambitious attempt by Microsoft to catch up on the work on virtualisation being undertaken in the wider computer industry. Darren Brown, data centre lead at consulting firm Avanade, said virtualisation had first established itself in data centres among companies with huge numbers of servers to manage. Putting applications, such as an e-mail engine or a database, on one machine brought up all kinds of problems when those machines had to undergo maintenance, needed updating or required a security patch to be applied. By putting virtual servers on one physical box, companies had been able to shrink the numbers of machines they managed and get more out of them, he said. ""The real savings are around physical management of the devices and associated licensing,"" he said. ""Physically, there is less tin to manage."" Equally, said Mr Brown, if one physical server failed the virtualised application could easily be moved to a separate machine. ""The same benefits apply to the PC,"" he said. ""Within the Microsoft environment, we have struggled for years with applications that are written so poorly that they will not work with others. ""Virtualising this gives you a couple of new ways to tackle those traditional problems,"" he said. Many companies were still using very old applications that existing operating systems would not run, he said. By putting a virtual machine on a PC, those older programs can be kept going. A virtual machine, like its name implies, is a software copy of a computer complete with operating system and associated programs. Closing Windows ""On the desktop we are seeing people place great value in being able to abstract the desktop from actual physical hardware,"" said Dan Chu, vice president of emerging products and markets at virtualisation specialist VMWare. Some virtual machines, he said, acted like Windows PCs to all intents and purposes. But many virtual machines were now emerging that were tuned for a particular industry, sector or job. ""People take their application, the operating system they want to run it against, package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client,"" he said. In such virtual machines, the core of the operating system can be very small and easy to transfer to different devices. This, many believe, is the idea behind Midori - to create a lightweight portable operating system that can easily be mated to many different applications. Microsoft's licensing terms for Windows currently prohibited it acting this way within a virtual appliance, said Mr Chu. Michael Silver, research vice president at Gartner, said the development of Midori was a sensible step for Microsoft. ""The value of Microsoft Windows, of what that product is today, will diminish as more applications move to the web and Microsoft needs to edge out in front of that,"" he said. ""I would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around,"" he said. The big problem that Microsoft faced in doing away with Windows, he said, was how to re-make its business to cope. ""Eighty percent of Windows sales are made when a new PC is sold,"" he said. ""That's a huge amount of money for them that they do not have to go out and get. ""If Windows ends up being less important over time as applications become more OS agnostic where will Microsoft make its money?"" he asked.

en.15.119.314.2009.4.17,Mumbai attack defendant Kasab claims confession coerced,"MUMBAI, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The lawyer for the alleged lone survivor among 10 gunmen who rampaged through Mumbai last November, killing 166 people, told a special court on Friday that his confession to the act was forced and he wanted to retract it. Police say Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, who sat barefoot in the dock dressed in a full-sleeve T-shirt and navy blue track pants, was one of the gunmen who arrived in Mumbai by sea from Pakistan to carry out the attacks. The men had waged a war against India with the intention of capturing Kashmir, state prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam told the court. ""There is prima facie evidence that it was a criminal conspiracy, a clear case of war against the country aimed at capturing Kashmir,"" he said without elaborating. ""It was a well-rehearsed and well-thought out plan backed by Pakistan intelligence agencies,"" Nikam said, reading from a statement he said was Kasab's confession, recorded shortly after he was captured. Pakistan's government has repeatedly denied any official involvement in the assault. Throughout the proceedings, Kasab, who could face the gallows if found guilty, sat quietly, hanging his head. Defence attorney Abbas Kazmi said Kasab wanted to retract the confession as it was made under duress. ""My client has said he was tortured and that the confession was forced. He therefore wants to retract it,"" Kazmi said. The court will pass an order on the validity of the confession on Saturday, Judge M.L. Tahilyani said. He said the court would examine witnesses to the confession to determine if it had been forced. Earlier, Tahilyani dismissed a defence submission that Kasab was 17 years old at the time of the attack and must therefore be tried at a juvenile court. The judge said Kasab has said in his statement he was 21-years-old, and also looked older. Nikam, who plans to produce more than 1,800 witnesses and more than 750 pieces of evidence to prove Kasab's guilt, said he would show the conspiracy was hatched in Pakistan and backed by intelligence agencies there. ""It is time for jihad, it is time to attack Hindustan (India) and since its business centre is Mumbai, we must attack Mumbai,"" Nikam said Kasab was told, reading from the confession statement. Nikam said he intends to prove Kasab's direct involvement in seven cases, and indirect involvement in five others. The attacks on India's financial hub sparked renewed tensions between India and Pakistan, with New Delhi saying state agencies were involved in the attacks."
en.15.119.460.2009.4.11,Is greed overcoming fear on Wall St?,"ANALYSIS By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. stocks typically rebound six months before the economy, but investors worry that the current 25 percent rally since the market's March 9 low could be a red herring. At the same time, lack of investor conviction -- or simple fear -- can be considered a sign of a healthy market. Reasons to be pessimistic about the economic outlook abound: unemployment is the highest since 1983, house prices are still falling by record amounts and persistent questions remain about which banks will still be in business next year. Many investors are holding out for clearer signs that the worst financial crisis in generations is over before they commit to jumping back into the stock market. They worry that more bad news awaits in the months ahead to trip up the latest rally. Declining volume tells part of the technical story. The average total value of stocks traded each day on the Nasdaq has fallen about 40 percent from 2008 levels so far this year through March. Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Market Volatility index .VIX, also remains stubbornly high, only dipping below 40 in recent sessions despite trading below 30 in more normal times. Still, stock prices may have reached a bottom in early March, said Linda Duessel, a market strategist at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. ""Insofar as 'Will investors jump back in like they have historically?' I think the numbers are showing that they are much more reluctant,"" she said. The S&P 500 Index is up 25 percent from a 12-1/2 year low in early March. Last week, a Reuters poll of Wall Street dealers showed seven of 11 economists forecast a turnaround starting in the third quarter. Yet investors big and small have been hit with huge losses, with the benchmark S&P 500 index down 46 percent since hitting an all-time high in October 2007. The equities market in the past has rebounded anywhere from three months to nine months before the economy reverses its slide, with the average time about six months. ""The market consensus right now is for positive GDP in the third quarter,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York. ""The worry is, that might be a little bit premature."" The U.S. economy is on track for the worst recession since World War Two, leaving investors warier than in other downturns in recent years. Wall Street has made several attempts to move higher since last October, only to be pulled back to new lows each time. Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in Nashville, would like to see even more investor skepticism, as the point of maximum optimism is typically the top of the market. ""The more skepticism we see (in the market), the better the chances the market has of going up,"" he said. ""We don't want to see optimism here, that would be a negative for market."" Given the view that the economy will turn around in the third quarter, some investors have returned to the market. ""People may be getting in sooner than the six months,"" said Carl Birkelbach, chairman and CEO of Birkelbach Investment Securities in Chicago. ""I think that people will always pit fear against greed and once the market starts moving up, greed will start taking ov"

The Portuguese, who was voted World Footballer of the Year in January, is one of five Manchester United nominees, a reflection on a season that could end with Alex Ferguson's side collecting five trophies. Central defensive partnership Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic are in contention for the award voted for by their fellow professionals while Ryan Giggs and goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar are also nominated. The 35-year-old Giggs, who has never won the award, has been in sparkling form for United as they aim to add the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup to the FIFA Club World Cup and English League Cup trophies they have already won. Dutchman Van der Sar managed a record 14 consecutive league clean sheets earlier this season. Title-chasing Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, who won the vote in 2006, completes the list of six.

The soldiers were patrolling a remote mountain road in the southern state of Guerrero on Wednesday when they ran into heavily armed drug gangsters who opened fire on them, Reforma newspaper said. The soldiers returned fire. Obama was to arrive in Mexico City on Thursday for his first visit to Latin America and Mexico's escalating drug war will top the agenda. Some 6,300 people died last year in drug killings in Mexico and the violence has begun to spill over into the United States. The Obama administration is tightening the U.S.-Mexico border to prevent trafficking of U.S. guns to Mexican cartels and is hoping to send Black Hawk helicopters to help Mexican President Felipe Calderon defeat well-armed cartels. Reforma said 13 people, including a soldier, died in the shootout in Guerrero. Another daily, El Universal, said the traffickers threw grenades at the soldiers and at least 10 people were killed. The traffickers were bringing drugs down from the mountains, El Universal said. The region is known for its crops of marijuana and poppy, which is used to make heroin. Mexican officials want Washington to reinstate a ban on assault weapons that expired in 2004. Some 90 percent of weapons used by Mexican gangs like the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels come from the United States, Mexican police say."

The UN Security Council unanimously condemned North Korea's launch of a long-range rocket on April 5 as contravening a UN ban and demanded enforcement of existing sanctions against Pyongyang. North Korea told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Tuesday that it had decided to revive all its facilities at its Soviet-era Yongbyon nuclear complex, including the reprocessing plant that produces plutonium for nuclear weapons. The United States has said the North has also asked American experts overseeing the Yongbyon shutdown under the deal to leave the country.

Laporta has been trying to clamp down on the activities of a radical group of fans known as the Boixos Nois (Mad Boys) since he was elected president in June 2003. ""We have to talk less and act more,"" Laporta said at a book presentation in Barcelona. ""Either we take steps to prevent them from travelling and getting into the stadiums or we'll see more serious incidents. We will continue to act with the same forcefulness and we will make no concessions to the aggressors."" A club security guard was punched in the face on Tuesday by a fan, widely reported by local media to be a member of the group, at the German hotel where players and staff were staying for the Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich. A Munich police spokesman said on Wednesday that five supporters had been detained until after the match but the fan who threw the punch was still at large. The security guard had not been seriously hurt, he added. In his time as president, Laporta has stopped the practice of giving the Boixos Nois group free tickets to matches and discount trips to away games and ordered the closure of the room in the Nou Camp where they stored banners. Laporta, who has received death threats from the group, said the club knew the identity of its members and was drawing up plans to prevent them travelling to away matches and gaining access to stadiums. The Boixos Nois were blamed for flare-throwing incidents at Barca's match at city rivals Espanyol in October when the referee was forced to halt play for almost 10 minutes and take the players off the field in the second half. ""These individuals continue to present a deplorable image that is neither that of Barcelona nor the vast majority of its fans, whose behaviour yesterday was model,"" said Laporta, whose team sealed a Champions League semi-final spot with a 5-1 aggregate victory over Bayern. ""The majority of fans who were in Munich behaved exquisitely except these criminals who dedicate themselves only to giving a beating to lads trying to do their jobs."

Before that, the issue will be raised before the cabinet, he added.

We will not allow that to happen."" ""On the other hand, we will support those NGOs serving humanity,"" said Shahid. 'States within a state' ""Some NGOs have created 'states within a state'.

en.15.119.343.2009.4.12,Study sees Sonadia as best deep-sea port site,"Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)The consultant for the proposed deep-sea port project has suggested the Sonadia-Moheshkhali point as the best location. The deep-sea port can be set up at Sonadia channel in three phases until 2055 at a cost of $ 1.2 billion with the first phase completed by 2016, Japan's Pacific Consultant International (PCI) added. In a feasibility study, it also said the impact of regional transit cargos for the proposed deep-sea port would be marginal, accounting for about 10 percent of the expected cargo-handling volume. The geographic location of Bangladesh enables the proposed port to have opportunities to be a major player in the regional trade and act as a gateway to the region, according to the study presented at a workshop Sunday. ""Sonadia Island succeeded so far as the best optimal location for a deep sea port out of the possible nine locations,"" Eddy Declercq, private sector expert of PCI told the workshop on 'Techno-Economic Feasibility Study of a Deep Sea Port in Bangladesh'. He also said transit cargo handling, predominantly from China, would be around 10 percent of the total volume. Good governance would be a key component for the project to be a success, said the PCI official. Touching on details, Declercq said a harbour of nine 300-metre jetties would be constructed along with required infrastructure and back-up facilities in the first phase. "" [The harbour] would allow berthing of 9 mother vessels, 4 containers and 5 general cargo vessels."" The second phase, expected to be completed by 2035, would see two more harbours with the same specifications. The deep-sea port would have six harbours when the third phase would be completed by 2055, the PCI expert said. The 31-month study since June 2006 proposed a 40-km railway track from Chittagong to Cox's Bazar, roads of the same length, development of inland waterways for transportation of goods with facilities of water treatment plant and thermal power plant. The study recommends forming an interim port authority before setting up a deep-sea port authority. The IPA would also be responsible for choosing investors from private sector to provide 70 percent of the fund for the project while the remainder would come from the government. Shipping minister Afsarul Amin urged donors to consider the possibilities for funding the project and said the government would do everything to secure funding for the project. ""The government will patronage public-private partnership for the project."" The study would be reviewed in light of suggestions from Sunday's workshop and then finalised, the minister told reporters afterwards. Prime minister's economic affairs adviser Mashiur Rahman stressed on attracting foreign and private investments for the project. ""The government would also need to look on issues like regulatory arrangements for the port for efficient management, ""he added. A need for review of tax laws and tax-harmonising would be required for handling transit cargos, said the prime minister's adviser. The workshop, organised by the shipping ministry, was participated by representatives from different government organisations, members of the technical committee and the parliamentary standing committee on shipping ministry."

Botha, 26, was also reported for 'chucking' after the third test against Australia in Sydney in January 2006 and was subsequently suspended from bowling. He underwent remedial action and resumed his international career in June 2007. ""We're confident we can get it (his action) back to where it should be,"" Barnes told reporters on Wednesday. ""We know we can get it right because we've done it before. ""There's been a bit of a media frenzy ... but Johan is dealing with it well. He's mentally strong and when it happened before it made him stronger."" SURPRISE CALL Barnes said the decision by umpires Asoka de Silva, Brian Jerling and Rudi Koertzen to report Botha had come as a surprise. An International Cricket Council (ICC) statement on Tuesday said the report by the umpires cited concern over the spinner's quicker ball and his 'doosra'. Barnes said Botha did not try to bowl the 'doosra', a delivery that turns away from a right-handed batsman, in Port Elizabeth on Monday when South Africa won by 61 runs to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series. ""It was disappointing and it came out of the blue,"" said the bowling coach. ""We've heard nothing from the Australians to suggest they had any doubts over his action. ""Johan and I have watched a video of the match and I find it strange he was called for bowling the 'doosra' because he did not try to bowl it once in his 10 overs. He hardly uses the 'doosra' because he has to bowl it a lot slower."" Barnes said Botha was a key bowler for South Africa. ""It's disappointing this happens when he's on top of his game and has become one of the best spin bowlers in limited-overs cricket,"" he said. ""Johan has bowled exceptionally well and we have depended on him to defend totals for us. ""What he has achieved in the last two years has been phenomenal, especially against Australia."" Botha will undergo an independent analysis of his action by the ICC's panel of human movement specialists. The process should be completed in five weeks. If he is found to have an illegal action he will be suspended from bowling in international cricket. Botha has played 45 one-dayers and two tests"

""We have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve Iran's nuclear problem. It will be offered to the West soon,"" Ahmadinejad said in a televised speech in the southeastern province of Kerman. The United States, Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain said last week they would ask European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana to invite Iran to a meeting to find ""a diplomatic solution to this critical issue."" It marked a significant shift in U.S. policy under President Barack Obama, whose predecessor George W. Bush shunned direct talks with Tehran as long as it pressed ahead with uranium enrichment that the West fears is meant to yield atomic bombs. Iran welcomed on Monday a ""constructive"" dialogue with the six world powers, in the clearest Iranian signal yet it would accept an invitation for talks on its disputed nuclear activity. Ahmadinejad did not give details of the new package, but said the world could not be ruled by ""using force."" ""This new package will ensure peace and justice for the world. It respects rights of all nations,"" he said. It was unclear whether Iran's counter-offer would be essentially different from previous ill-fated exchanges. The six world powers originally offered Iran economic and political incentives in 2006 to suspend enrichment. Iran's response hinted at some flexibility but ruled out suspension as a precondition for talks as stipulated by the powers. PREVIOUS OFFERS WENT NOWHERE Last June the six improved the offer while retaining the precondition. In reply, Iran said it wanted to negotiate a broader peace and security deal and rejected any ""condescending"" formula to shelve its nuclear program. Western officials said Iran's second response endorsed talks for talks' sake and was useless because it again sidestepped the suspension issue. They felt Iran was trying to buy time to expand and make irreversible its nuclear program. The New York Times reported on Monday that the Obama administration and its European allies are considering dropping a long-standing U.S. demand that Iran shut down its nuclear facilities as a precondition for full negotiations. An Iranian official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters on Wednesday that ""suspension is out of the question"" but that Iran did want to get talks rolling with major powers. ""Eventually Iran may agree to accept the (U.N. nuclear watchdog's) Additional Protocol,"" the official said. The protocol, which expands on the basic nuclear safeguards accords many countries have with the International Atomic Energy Agency, permits short-notice IAEA inspections beyond declared nuclear sites, to help verify no covert activity is going on. Iran stopped voluntarily implementing the Additional Protocol in 2006 in retaliation for initial U.N. sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic. While seeking to engage Iran, the Obama administration has also warned of moves to impose tougher sanctions if Tehran keeps defying United Nations demands to halt sensitive nuclear work. Iran, the world's fourth-largest oil producer, says its nuclear program is aimed at generating electricity. It has repeatedly ruled out halting its uranium enrichment campaign. Underlining Iran's intention to continue with its nuclear drive despite Western pressure, Ahmadinejad on April 9 inaugurated its first nuclear fuel fabrication plant and said the country had now mastered the entire fuel cycle."
en.15.119.140.2009.4.11,Thai protests cancel Asian summit,"Pattaya, Thailand, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A summit of Asian leaders in Thailand was cancelled on Saturday after anti-government protesters breeched security and swarmed into the media centre at the hotel complex where it was being held. Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva declared a state of emergency in the beach resort of Pattaya, where the East Asia Summit was being held, about 150 km (90 miles) south of the capital, Bangkok. ""The task for me and the government now is to provide security for the leaders to travel back home safely,"" Abhisit said in a brief address on television. The cancellation is a huge embarrassment for Abhisit's government, which came to power in December via parliamentary defections the opposition says were engineered by the military. The weekend's events will raise questions about how enduring his government can be after four prime ministers over the last 15 months have failed to resolve Thailand's deep political rifts. Many of the leaders of 16 Asian nations due to attend the summit had already arrived or were arriving in Pattaya on Saturday. Hundreds of red-shirted supporters of ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra broke through lines of soldiers and smashed a window at the conference centre housing the media adjacent to the summit venue, the Royal Cliff hotel, blowing whistles, waving flags and shouting slogans. Troops chased after them, but then bolted down the road to the hotel itself to prevent the protesters from reaching the venue where Asian leaders were scheduled to hold a lunch. RED SHIRTS v BLUE SHIRTS After rampaging about the media centre, the ""red shirts"" were soon huddling with reporters in impromptu news conferences around the vast conference centre. Among them was a 90-year-old woman in a wheelchair. The East Asia Summit brings together the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand for discussions about trade, economic issues and regional security. ASEAN leaders were to sign an investment agreement with China, but that was scrapped after the blockade kept Chinese Premier Wen Jiaboa from reaching the Royal Cliff Hotel. The ""red shirts"" had intended to protest peacefully but became infuriated when a group of blue-shirted pro-government protesters arrived on the scene. ""There were at least two cases of shootings aimed to harm our red-shirt supporters, a clear evidence of government supporters possessing guns and using them directly at us,"" the United Front of Democracy against Dictatorship said. Government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn earlier described the ""blue shirts"" as people ""we believe are concerned about the meetings. They want them to continue, and they want them to continue peacefully"". But Reuters photographers said the blue shirts, wearing balaclavas or scarves to keep from being identified, had clubs, bricks and slingshots and thrown smoke bombs as they clashed with ""red shirts"". On Friday, at least 2,000 ""red shirts"" broke through roadblocks manned by police and soldiers, pushing aside police vans and buses and even commandeered a fire truck. Abhisit has insisted he will not give in to demands to step down made by Thaksin, a billionaire populist living in exile to avoid jail on a corruption conviction. He was ousted in a 2006 coup, but his reconstituted party regained power after elections, sparking months of protests last year by ""yellow shirts"" that closed airports in Bangkok and took a huge toll on the economy."
en.15.119.419.2009.4.13,United and Villarreal look to regain lost shine,"ROME, April 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United and Villarreal must find some misplaced form to get the away results they need in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final second legs. United, who visit Porto, have not looked much like European and English champions recently and have a lot to do to reach the last four after last week's disappointing 2-2 draw with the Portuguese side at Old Trafford. Late goals by 17-year-old Federico Macheda scraped victories over Sunderland and Aston Villa in their last two Premier League games to keep them top following defeats by Fulham and Liverpool. Jose Mourinho, who was Porto coach when they knocked United out on the way to winning the competition in 2004, said Alex Ferguson's men are a very different prospect from the side who eliminated his Inter Milan last month. ""Manchester United are in great difficulty at the moment,"" Mourinho told a news conference. ""Porto went there, they played a good match and the result was fair. But the return leg is still open."" Like United, Spanish contenders Villarreal also need a win or a high-scoring draw to progress after being held 1-1 at home by Arsenal. They are struggling for form too. They suffered their third defeat in four domestic games in going down 2-0 at home to Malaga on Saturday. PIRES OPTIMISITIC Their plight has been complicated by the loss of Spain midfielder Marcos Senna, the author of a stunning goal in the first leg, who suffered a leg muscle strain on Saturday. Midfielder Robert Pires remains upbeat though before the clash with his former club, who beat Wigan 4-1 on Saturday for their fifth consecutive victory in the English top flight. ""Our squad is one of the best in Spain and in Europe. We can undoubtedly (win the Champions League),"" the Frenchman told the club website (www.villarrealcf.es). ""We are going to try to reach (the final in) Rome. We know it's very hard, but I think this squad has a chance of winning this competition."" On the other side of the draw, after big first-leg wins Chelsea and Barcelona are on course to meet in the semi-finals ahead of their respective returns legs at home to Liverpool and away to Bayern Munich on Tuesday. Chelsea beat their Premier League rivals 3-1 at Anfield, while Barcelona thrashed the Germans 4-0 at the Nou Camp. However, the pair should not take anything for granted as Liverpool and Bayern both showed they are capable of piling up the goals at the weekend with 4-0 wins over Blackburn Rovers and Eintracht Frankfurt"
en.15.119.53.2009.4.10,Fed says plan now to avert inflation,"TULSA, Oklahoma, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States economy will skid more deeply into recession in coming months, Federal Reserve policy-makers warned on Thursday, but it is time to start planning how to wind down spending to avert an inflationary surge. The president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, Thomas Hoenig, said that hard as it was to predict when the winding-down process must be initiated, it will happen. ""We know it has to happen, but the timing I can't tell you. Nobody knows. We will watch every indicator of data that suggests a recovery is on the way,"" Hoenig said in response to audience questions after a speech in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""Failure to do that at the right time means you risk a much higher inflation environment,"" he added. Hoenig acknowledged the economy remains ""under significant stress"" from the ongoing banking crisis. But he said the U.S. central bank cannot wait until it is well into recovery and the job market is strong before acting. The Fed's second longest-serving policy-maker added that he expects resistance ""almost immediately"" to any move to raise interest rates or, for example, to start selling off its stash of mortgage-backed securities. Hoenig and a second regional Fed bank president, Gary Stern of Minneapolis, said there were still significant credit strains holding the economy back and cautioned that an eventual rebound likely will be mild. ""The recession is likely to persist for some time longer, and the initial stage of the recovery seems likely to be subdued,"" Stern said in remarks prepared for the South Dakota economic summit in Sioux Falls. ""In view of the state of the credit markets, it seems a fair bet that it will take time for momentum to build. But ... as we get into the middle of 2010 and beyond, I would expect to see a resumption of healthy growth,"" he added. A third speaker, White House Economic Adviser Lawrence Summers, told the Economic Club in Washington that there were ""substantial downdrafts"" hindering a U.S. recovery. ""Economies don't go from losing 600,000 jobs a month to a terribly happy path overnight,"" he said. But Summers added that overstocked inventories were being drawn down and ""the sense of a ball falling off a table, which is what the economy has felt like since the middle of last fall, I think we can be reasonably confident that that's going to end within the next few months."" Hoenig said getting the banks back into good health was vital for a sustained recovery. ""The restoration of normal financial activity depends on how we deal with the problems of our largest financial institutions,"" he said, and policy-makers need to be mindful of public dissatisfaction with costly taxpayer-funded bailouts. Even at larger institutions, ""failure does have to be an option in an economic system such as ours,"" he said, adding that as part of the resolution process, senior management at the failed firms should be replaced. Summers said there was little choice now but to do everything possible to stimulate economic activity. But he said the Fed must be ready to act decisively in the medium term to restrain spending so that inflation is contained. ""The thing about an inflation is that ... the moment it's absolutely clear you have the problem is a moment when you may have been too late in addressing it,"" Summers said. ""So I think it's a very difficult balance the policy is going to have to walk."" Stern said the risk of a jump in either inflation or deflation could not be dismissed out of hand but doubted either would become a huge problem. ""If economic growth resumes in the United States as I expect, the threat of deflation should diminish commensurately,"" he said, while expressing skepticism that a big increase in the Fed's balance sheet was sowing the seeds of inflation. ""The relation between growth in the money supply and the path of prices holds in the long run, over periods of at least five and more likely 10 years. Thus, there is ample time to withdraw excess liquidity as appropriate,"" he"

en.15.119.38.2009.4.10,Police extend search in UK terrorism investigation,"LONDON, April 10 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - British police said on Friday they were searching a 10th address as part of a major counter-terrorism operation in northwest England to thwart a suspected al Qaeda plot involving Pakistani nationals. Twelve men -- 11 of them Pakistanis -- were arrested in dramatic daylight raids by hundreds of officers on Wednesday. Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he had spoken with Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari by telephone on Thursday night to discuss the operation. Brown's office said they agreed that Britain and Pakistan ""share a serious threat from terrorism and violent extremism"", and had committed to ""work together to address this common challenge"". Most terrorist plots in Britain since Sept. 11, 2001 have had links to Pakistan, including suicide bombings in July 2005 which killed 52 people on London's underground and bus network. Greater Manchester Police said in a statement that the new search was taking place at an address in Liverpool. They added that the suspects arrested were still in custody ""in various locations across the country"". Police did not anticipate making any further announcements on Friday. Wednesday's raids had to be brought forward because of a security blunder by Britain's top counter-terrorism officer, Bob Quick, who was photographed entering Brown's 10 Downing Street residence openly carrying a secret document on the operation. The document, headlined ""Briefing Note: Operation Pathway"" and marked ""secret"", described it as a ""Security Service-led investigation into suspected AQ (al Qaeda) driven attack planning within the UK"". Quick resigned on Thursday, acknowledging that ""my action could have compromised a major counter-terrorism operation""."
en.15.119.479.2009.4.16,India starts marathon vote marred by Maoist attacks,"VARANASI, India, Thu Apr 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With Maoist insurgents stepping up attacks, tens of millions of Indians began voting in a month-long general election on Thursday with signs an unstable coalition may emerge in the middle of an economic slowdown. The ruling Congress party-led coalition appears to lead against an alliance headed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but both may need the support of a host of smaller and unpredictable regional parties to win office. The fear among investors is that the world's largest democratic exercise involving 714 million voters and hundreds of parties will lead to the rise of a ""Third Front"" government of communist and regional groups. ""The signs are the election will lead to a short-lived arrangement,"" said V. Ravichandar, managing director of Feedback Consulting, which advises multinationals in India. ""It will be like Italy, something happens every year or year and a half."" The uncertainty comes as a once-booming India reels from a crunch that has cost millions of jobs. It has ignited fears of political limbo just as India balances needs to help millions of poor with worries over its biggest fiscal gap in two decades. Highlighting growing militant threats, Maoists killed five election officials in a landmine blast in Chhattisgarh. Eleven police were killed in other attacks across India's central and eastern ""red belt"" where Thursday's election was centred. Maoists kidnapped four poll officials in Jharkhand. While most Indians voted peacefully, in some Maoist hit areas people did not vote, fearing attacks by the rebels who threatened to cut off their hands. The government has deployed hundreds of thousands of police to protect more than 140 million people who can vote on Thursday in polls that cover some of India's poorest states hit by the four-decade old Maoist insurgency. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described Maoist violence as India's biggest internal security threat and 500 civilians and police were killed in insurgent clashes last year. The outcome of the five-stage election will be known on May 16. India's elections are notoriously hard to predict and polls have been wrong in the past. Exit polls are banned. A clear win by either of the two main parties could see a rally on India's markets, but the emergence of a weak coalition of regional and communist parties could see stocks fall by as much as 30 percent, market watchers say. ARRAY OF CASTES Thursday's election ranged from the snowbound Chinese border to holy towns on the Ganges River. Some election officials rode elephants to remote polling stations near the Myanmar border. Other ballots were brought by two-day sea trips to the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal. In Varanasi, many voters arrived on bicycles and bullock carts to cast electronic votes. Women in saris or burqas, often carrying children, pressed buttons with pictorial symbols of each party, after their fingers were marked with ink to avoid fraud. ""India needs many things like jobs for people, homes, water, roads but what is needed first is a stable government"", said Sanjay Singh, a college student and a first time voter. Ancient caste, religious and ethnic ties will play a huge role in the vote as well as national problems like the slowdown, security fears and local issues from the building of a village water pump to problems of wild elephants trampling on villagers. The Congress party is wooing voters with populist measures such as food subsidies in a country were hundreds of millions live below the poverty line. Singh is Congress's official candidate. But Rahul Gandhi, the 38-year-old scion of India's most powerful family dynasty, has become one of Congress's main election cards, criss-crossing the nation in helicopter. The BJP accuses its main rival of poor governance and being weak on security, after a string of militant attacks last year culminated in a rampage in Mumbai by Islamist gunmen that killed 166 people and hiked tensions with nuclear-armed Paki"

The rally at BNP's Naya Paltan headquarters was a part of the party's two-day countrywide protest programme announced the previous day in reaction to the cabinet decision ""Withdraw the illegal decision before it is too late. The government will have to bear the consequences if it wants to do something illegal through intimidation, flouting rules and regulations,"" Delwar warned. ""The government has taken the decision to gloss over its failures including proper investigation into the of BDR carnage,"" he said. A cabinet meeting, chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday, decided to cancel the lease on the 6 Moinul Road bungalow in Dhaka Cantonment that was given to Khaleda Zia after the May 30, 1981 killing of her husband, BNP 'founder' and army chief-turned-president Zia. Hasina has argued that the house was allocated to Khaleda in violation of Cantonment Board law. . In public interest, says law minister The law minister on Thursday said the government had cancelled the lease ""in the interest of the people and the state"". Shafiq Ahmed told reporters it was not done, as the main opposition BNP claims, to satisfy any political vengeance. It was done simply because the house had been allotted illegally and to right that wrong, the lease allotment has to be repealed, he clarified. ""You'll get the answer to this riddle if you ask anyone if the same person can be entitled to receive two similarly appointed government houses,"" Shafiq said. ""If one raises the issue of [late president] Ziaur Rahman's attachment to the house, then someone else might argue that Ganabhaban bears the burden of Bangabandhu and his family's memories."" He said the government had allotted prime minister Sheikh Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana a house in Dhanmondi. But the past BNP-led alliance government cancelled the allotment, built a police station there and the then prime minister, Khaleda, inaugurated that. Shafiq said, replying to a question, ""If that government could do that, why the present one would not commit similar acts?"" Asked if he believed the decision might touch off political unrest, he said, ""In Bangladesh, everything is given a political colour, whereas this is only an ordinary decision taken in the interest of the state and its people."" ""The allotment process followed while handing the house to Khaleda Zia was illegal. And, one person cannot be the recipient of two houses,"" he said. Revenge, says Delwar Delwar said Thursday that the Cantonment Board leased out the allotment of the house legally and the cabinet could not cancel the lease. He said that the prime minister had taken the move as revenge over the cancellation of allotment of Ganobhaban in her name. ""The move is designed not only to dispossess the Zia family but also to destroy the nationalist forces,"" he added Several hundred activists from different units of BNP and pro-BNP groups joined the protest rally at Naya Paltan. The rally was attended by other party leaders. Pro-BNP lawyers, meanwhile, brought out a protest procession at the Old Dhaka court premises. They condemned the cabinet decision to cancel the lease of the Khaleda's cantonment house and demanded immediate cancellation of the order. Party leaders and activists across the country held agitation programmes in protest against the government's decision over the BNP chief's cantonment residence. In Chittagong, they brought out a procession from the party office at Nasiman Bhaban. A brief rally presided over by former whip Wahedul Alam was addressed by local leaders.

en.15.119.444.2009.4.15,Chelsea reach semis after thrilling 4-4 draw,"LONDON, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Chelsea reached the Champions League semi-finals for the fifth time in six seasons after a thrilling 4-4 draw with Liverpool put them through 7-5 on aggregate against their Premier League rivals on Tuesday. Liverpool, trailing 3-1 from the first leg at Anfield and without injured captain Steven Gerrard, threatened to pull off a sensational comeback but ultimately failed in their quest to reach the last four and a meeting with Barcelona. The 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster on Wednesday added to the raw emotion and electrifying atmosphere at Stamford Bridge as Liverpool built a 2-0 lead, then trailed 3-2 before coming back to go 4-3 ahead with seven minutes left. Chelsea, without suspended skipper John Terry, scored a late equaliser through Frank Lampard, his second goal of the game. ""We made it very hard for ourselves with our first half performance but it was a great night, we are through. It's been a great tie,"" Lampard told ITV. ""I don't know what we did in the first half, we maybe approached the game in the wrong way, we thought we were almost through but we showed our character at halftime to turn it round."" Needing at least three goals to give themselves a chance of saving the tie, five-times European champions Liverpool went 1-0 up after 19 minutes thanks to fine improvisation from Brazilian Fabio Aurelio. The defender shaped to swing the ball across to Liverpool's waiting players at the far post but instead fired into the gap that Chelsea keeper Petr Cech created by his near post as he was organising the defence. Cech, who looked short on confidence throughout the match, desperately scrambled across to stop the shot but it was in the back of the net before he had a chance to stop it. Serbian Branislav Ivanovic, who scored twice in the first leg, turned from hero to villain by holding Xabi Alonso and conceding a penalty nine minutes later. Spaniard Alonso sent Cech the wrong way to make it 2-0 and 3-3 on aggregate. TACTICAL SWITCH Chelsea's interim manager Guus Hiddink made a tactical switch in his attack with Nicolas Anelka replacing Salomon Kalou but it made little difference before halftime. Undeterred, Chelsea hit back after the break with two goals in six minutes. Anelka crossed low from the right for Didier Drogba to get the finest of touches and Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina could only divert the ball into his own net. Then on 57 minutes, Chelsea won a free kick and Brazilian Alex blasted a fierce shot past Reina. Lampard put Chelsea 3-2 up with a low shot, but Lucas scored with a deflected effort and Dutch striker Dirk Kuyt headed in from close range to make it 4-3 to Liverpool and leave them needing one further goal to pull off a miraculous comeback. Their hopes were ended a minute from time when Lampard produced a precise finish from Drogba's cross. It was Liverpool's second successive exit from the Champions League at the hands of Chelsea who beat them in the semi-finals last season before losing to Manchester United in the final. ""We are disappointed because to score four goals away in this game was unbelievable,"" said Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez. ""It's a pity. We played a very good ga"

en.15.119.469.2009.4.15,Somali pirates attack again,"By Alison Bevege ON BOARD CORTE-REAL, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somali pirates hijacked two more cargo vessels and opened fire on a third on Tuesday in attacks that showed a determination to go on striking at shipping on the region's strategic trade routes. The capture of the Greek-owned MV Irene E.M. and Togo-flagged MV Sea Horse were a clear sign pirate gangs have not been deterred by two raids in recent days in which U.S. and French special forces have killed five pirates. NATO Lieutenant Commander Alexandre Fernandes said the Portuguese warship Corte-Real had received a pre-dawn distress call from the St. Vincent and the Grenadines-flagged Irene E.M. as it traveled through the Gulf of Aden. ""There was only three minutes between the alarm and the hijack,"" Fernandes told Reuters aboard the warship. ""They attacked at night, which was very unusual. They were using the moonlight as it's still quite bright."" Greece's Merchant Marine Ministry said the Irene E.M.'s 22 crew were Filipinos. The East African Seafarers' Assistance Programme, which tracks piracy, said they were all unharmed. The bulk carrier was sailing from Jordan to India. Its Piraeus-based owners were not immediately available for comment. Hours later, NATO officials on the Corte-Real said the nearly 5,000-tonne MV Sea Horse had also been seized about 77 nautical miles off Somalia. It was hijacked by pirates on board three or four skiffs, they said. The officials said another pirate gang fired automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades at the Liberian-flagged 21,887-tonne Safmarine Asia. They said it managed to escape and that there was no word of any casualties. Heavily armed pirates from lawless Somalia have been increasingly striking the busy Indian Ocean shipping lanes and strategic Gulf of Aden, capturing dozens of vessels, hundreds of hostages and making off with millions of dollars in ransoms. SPECIAL FORCES The pirates have vowed to take revenge on U.S. and French citizens after the military operations by Washington and Paris. Foreign navies are patrolling the seas off Somalia but the pirates have largely evaded them, driving up insurance costs and defying the world's most powerful militaries. Until there is political stability onshore, say experts, attacks on shipping will continue off Somalia's coast. ""Piracy is far more complex than any naval patrol,"" said U.S. analyst J. Peter Pham, of Madison University. ""It will require more than just the application of force to uproot piracy from the soil of Somalia."" Snipers on a U.S. Navy destroyer freed an American ship captain on Sunday by killing three Somali pirates holding him hostage in a lifeboat, ending a five-day standoff. Two more pirates died on Friday when French commandos stormed a yacht that had been seized. A French hostage was also killed. A.P. Moller Maersk, owner of the U.S.-captained Maersk Alabama caught up in Sunday's incident, said it was reviewing policies and procedures for sailing off Somalia and urged the international community to unite to find a solution to piracy. The Somali pirates have been striking regularly for years. They are currently holding prisoner some 260 sailors, including about 100 Filipinos, on 19 captured ships. Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he had ordered a review of the U.S. military's strategy on piracy after the Maersk Alabama incident. He told ABC television's ""Good Morning America"" show on Tuesday he had asked senior officers to look ""broadly and widely and deeply at the overall strategy."" ""One of the big challenges, quite frankly, is when we capture pirates, what do you do with them? What criminal court do you take them to? ... It's a very big challenge."" Asked about the possibility of pirates seeking revenge, he said he took their comments seriously: ""That said, we're very well prepared to deal with anything like th"

en.15.119.272.2009.4.10,"Japan extends North Korea sanctions, UN split","TOKYO Fri Apr 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan on Friday extended economic sanctions on North Korea by a year to punish it for what was widely seen as a long-range missile test, but softened its drive for a United Nations resolution to chastise Pyongyang. North Korea is likely to escape any serious fallout from the Sunday launch, analysts and diplomats have said, while its leader Kim Jong-il has been able to win enormous political gain at home for a defiant act that helped tighten his iron grip on power. Japan has called for a fresh, legally binding resolution by the U.N. Security Council to declare Pyongyang in violation of a previous resolution banning the firing of ballistic missiles. But Russia and China, permanent veto-wielding council members, have opposed the move, unconvinced the launch was a violation. After days of deadlock, diplomats said Japan's close ally Washington had indicated it might be willing to accept a nonbinding statement rather than a resolution. ""Frankly speaking, to express the views of the international community, a binding resolution would be desirable for Japan,"" Aso told a news conference. ""But ... there is no point if we are hung up on a resolution and if its content does not make sense,"" he added. ""While there are various forms such as a statement or a resolution, what is essential is for the international community to send a proper message."" Japan's Yomiuri newspaper said that China and the United States were now in nearly full accord on a non-binding statement and that Japan was moving toward agreement. A nonbinding statement would likely be seen as a diplomatic blow for Japan at home, where Aso is struggling with low voter support ahead of an election this year. It might also fan concern among some Japanese that Washington is moving closer to Beijing. Aso leaves on Friday for a summit of 16 Asian countries in Thailand, where diplomats say Japan will push for leaders to issue a statement about North Korea's launch. LAVISH PRAISE Japan's extension of its own unilateral sanctions is seen as mostly symbolic because the measures have caused scant harm to the North's already broken-down economy, which has little to export other than arms to what many consider rogue states. Sanctions previously set for six months have been extended four times since they began in 2006, with Japan citing lack of progress in talks to denuclearise the North and to investigate Pyongyang's past abduction of Japanese citizens. New measures announced on Friday tighten the oversight of fund transfers to its secretive neighbour. North Korea in its official media has blasted Japan for creating ""a ruckus"" over the launch and said any attempts by Tokyo to fish out pieces of the rocket that splashed down off the Japanese coast would be a military provocation. North Korea said it has put a satellite into orbit that is now circling the globe playing revolutionary songs as part of its peaceful space programme. U.S. and South Korean military officials said nothing was placed into orbit and all parts of the missile known as the Taepodong-2 crashed into the sea in a flight of about 3,200 km. The missile is designed to carry a warhead as far as Alaska. The North's propaganda machine has lavished praise on the launch and leader Kim, 67, whose suspected stroke in August raised questions about his control and whether anyone was waiting in the wings to take over Asia's only communist dynasty, analysts said. A gaunt Kim, with thinning hair and a noticeable limp, appeared at his first major state event since the suspected stroke last year when parliament re-elected him as the country's supreme military leader on Thursday. Kim put to rest any doubt about whom he sees as his second in command when the rubber stamp parliament elevated his brother-in-law and close confidant Jang Song-taek to a powerful military post, analysts said on Friday. The energetic and urbane Jang, 63, an economic specialist considered pragmatic and worldly, is seen as the most likely choice to take over should Kim suddenly pass away. He could also mentor one of Kim's three known sons if he decides to groom them for succes"
en.15.119.389.2009.4.12,Maoists win three of six seats in Nepal by-elections,"KATHMANDU, Sun Apr 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's Maoist former rebels, who now lead a coalition government, have won three of six parliamentary seats in by-elections, their first popularity test since last year. The Election Commission also said on Sunday that the centrist opposition Nepali Congress party and two other constituents of the ruling coalition won a seat each. The results of Friday's by-elections for six seats in the special constituent assembly which also doubles as the Himalayan nation's parliament, would not significantly affect the government, an analyst said. Lok Raj Baral, chief of independent think-tank Nepal Centre for Strategic Studies said the Maoists' top position in parliament compared to other parties hadn't been affected. ""But the popular votes cast for the Maoist candidates and the margin with which they won has narrowed, which shows that they are not as popular as they were during last year's constituent assembly elections,"" he said. The Maoists, who waged a decade-long civil war from 1996 against the 239-year-old monarchy, abandoned the conflict under a 2006 peace deal and scored a surprise victory in last year's election for the 601-seat assembly. Following their election victory last year the Maoists -- who after the by-elections will hold 238 seats in the assembly -- got the monarchy abolished, their main demand during the war, and have headed the governing coalition since August. When they took power the Maoists pledged to create a ""new Nepal"" and provide relief to the people. Nearly one third of the 27 million Nepalis still live on less than a dollar a day. The government is also battling the highest inflation in more than a decade and a crippling power shortage that has sparked some anti-government protests.

A pirate source said the four pirates holding the American captain of a cargo ship, Richard Phillips, in a drifting lifeboat under the gaze of a U.S. warship were demanding $2 million for his release and a guarantee of their own safety. They have been holding Phillips since a foiled attempt on Wednesday to hijack the 17,000-tonne, Danish-owned Maersk Alabama several hundred miles off Somalia. Close by, the destroyer USS Bainbridge was in radio contact with the pirates seeking a peaceful outcome to the standoff with the assistance of FBI experts, a U.S. official said. But the pirate source told Reuters from the fishing port of Haradheere, a pirate den in Somalia, that another group that hijacked the 20,000-tonne German container vessel, the Hansa Stavanger, a week ago were heading to the scene of the standoff in the Indian Ocean. The ship, seized off south Somalia between Kenya and the Seychelles, has a crew of 24, of whom five are German. ""Knowing that the Americans will not destroy this German ship and its foreign crew, they hope they can meet their friends on the lifeboat,"" said the pirate, who has given reliable information in the past but asked not to be named. The Norwegian-owned, 23-000-tonne tanker Bow Asir, held since the end of March, was released after a ransom was paid by its owners, pirate sources said. A spokesman for operator Salhus Shipping AS confirmed the vessel, which has a crew of 27, had been released, but gave no details. Sources put the payment at around $2.4 million. Located on the Horn of Africa across from the Middle East, Somalia has suffered 18 years of civil conflict since warlords overthrew former dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. PROTECTING SEA ROUTES Last year there were an unprecedented number of hijackings off Somalia -- 42 in total. That disrupted shipping, delayed food aid to east Africa, increased insurance costs and persuaded some firms to send cargoes round South Africa instead of through the Suez Canal, a critical route for oil. It also brought a massive international response, with ships from the United States, Europe, China, Japan and others flocking to the region to protect the sea-routes. Phillips apparently volunteered to get in a lifeboat with the pirates on Wednesday in exchange for the safety of his crew, who regained control of the ship laden with relief food destined for Kenya. Phillips leaped into the sea during the night and tried to swim away but at least one pirate quickly followed and he was hauled back onto the lifeboat, a U.S. official said. ""He didn't get very far,"" the official told Reuters. The pirate gang holding him remained defiant despite the arrival of U.S. and other naval ships in the area. ""We are not afraid of the Americans,"" one of the pirates told Reuters by satellite phone. ""We will defend ourselves if attacked."" In Washington, the Pentagon had no comment on the pirates' plan to move the German vessel or any ransom demand. U.S. officials confirmed that reinforcements were nearby. A second American warship, guided missile frigate USS Halyburton equipped with helicopters, and a German frigate, had arrived in the vicinity of the standoff, they said. The USS Boxer, an amphibious assault ship, was also heading for the lifeboat's general area, mainly in case its medical facilities were required, one U.S. official said. The U.S. Navy is using a drone for surveillance of the lifeboat, he said. In Paris, French President Nicolas Sarkozy's office said the decision to launch an assault to rescue hostages from the sailing boat, the Tanit, had been taken after the gang refused to accept the French navy's terms and tried to sail toward the coast. The boat, carrying two couples and a three-year-old child, was seized by the pirates far off-shore on April 4. ""During the operation, a hostage sadly died,"" a statement said. It gave no details of the circumstances. Two pirates were also killed and three were captured. PEACEFUL SOLUTION Maritime groups say the likeliest outcome from the U.S. hostage saga is a negotiated solution, possibly involving safe passage in exchange for the captive. U.S. Somalia expert Ken Menkhaus said the best outcome would be for the German ship to be allowed to pick up Phillips and his captors and take them to shore, and for a ransom to be paid for the American. ""It would mean no loss of life and no risk to the lives of the other hostages. And at the end of the day an insurance company would be out $2 million -- probably just $1 million after negotiations,"" Menkhaus said. Phillips is one of about 270 hostages being held by Somali pirates, who have been preying on the busy sea-lanes of the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean for years. They are keeping 18 captured vessels -- five of them taken this week alone -- at or near lairs on the Somali coast. Yet the fact Phillips is the first American citizen seized, and the drama of his 20-man crew stopping the Alabama being hijacked on Wednesday, has galvanized U.S. attention. It has also given President Barack Obama another foreign policy problem in a place most Americans would rather forget. They remember with a shudder the disastrous U.S.-U.N. intervention in Mogadishu, including the ""Black Hawk Down"" battle in 1993 when 18 U.S. troops were killed in a 17-hour firefight that later inspired a book and a movie."

Charges of the twin cases, for murder and bombing, were framed at noon by Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge ANN Bashirullah. All the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges. Six dates were fixed by the judge to take statement of the witnesses for the two cases  May 3, 4 and 5 for the murder case and April 28, 29 and 30 for the bombing case. Earlier, charges could not be framed as the prosecution appealed for time. Seven New Year revellers died at the scene on April 14, 2001 and three of the score wounded died at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Aminullah Aman, Ibrahim Khalil, Mahbub Afjal, Rafiqul Islam, Swapan Kumar Das, Reza, Mahmudul Kabir, Asim, Omar Faruq were among the dead.

Japan, which considers whaling to be a cherished cultural tradition, killed 679 minke whales despite plans to catch around 850. It caught just one fin whale compared with a target of 50 in the hunt that began in November. Some ships in its six-ship fleet have returned home after clashes with the hardline group Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, including a collision that crushed a railing on one of the Japanese ships. A Fisheries Agency official said ships could not carry out whaling for a total of 16 days because of bad weather and skirmishes with the activists. Japan officially stopped commercial whaling after agreeing to a global moratorium in 1986, but began what it calls a scientific research whaling program the following year. Whale meat can be found in some supermarkets and restaurants. The agency has declined to comment on a recent report that Japan is considering reducing the number of whales it catches each year. Japan has a moratorium on catching humpback whales, a favorite with whale watchers, after international criticism."
en.15.119.403.2009.4.11,Japan to scrap plan for North Korea resolution: Kyodo,"TOKYO, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan is expected to withdraw a proposal for the UN Security Council to adopt a binding resolution on North Korea's rocket launch, Kyodo news reported, a day after Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso appeared to back off from insistence on a resolution. Instead, Tokyo is expected to eventually accept a weaker draft presidential statement the United States has circulated to the permanent council members and Japan to break the stalemate between Tokyo and Beijing, Kyodo said, citing diplomatic sources. Japan will notify the five permanent members -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- of the plan when they resume talks on Saturday, the news agency reported. But Japan's Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone said on Saturday he had told his Chinese counterpart Japan still favoured passing a resolution. ""As far as we are concerned, a resolution is desirable,"" Nakasone told reporters in Pattaya, Thailand. He said he had conveyed by telephone on Saturday to Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, who is also in Pattaya for an Asian summit. ""If we are to have a strong, unified message from the international community, a resolution is desirable,"" Nakasone said. A trilateral meeting between Nakasone, Yang and South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan on the sidelines of the summit at the Thai beach resort had to be called off on Saturday after demonstrators blocked the entrance to the venue. Japan on Friday extended economic sanctions on North Korea by a year to punish it for what was widely seen as a long-range missile test, and it has called for a legally binding resolution by the U.N. Security Council to declare Pyongyang in violation of a previous resolution banning the firing of ballistic missiles. But Russia and China, permanent veto-wielding council members, have opposed the move, unconvinced the launch was a violation. After days of deadlock, diplomats said Japan's close ally Washington had indicated it might be willing to accept a nonbinding statement rather than a resolution. Aso said on Friday it was important for the international community to send a strong message, rather than focus on what form that took. But a non-binding statement would likely be seen as a diplomatic blow for Japan, the only country under the flight path of the rocket. That could hurt Aso, who is struggling with low voter support ahead of an election that must be held this year and fan concern among some Japanese that Washington is moving closer to Beijing"
en.15.119.418.2009.4.11,"After Italy's quake, Pope reflects on disasters","ROME, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict reflected on the tragedies and disasters that test faith during a Good Friday procession in Rome, just hours after Italians buried victims of the country's devastating earthquake. The pontiff offered a special prayer for survivors of Monday's quake, asking that they find hope, despite a disaster that killed at least 289 people and left almost 40,000 homeless. ""We pray that even for them, on this dark night, a star of hope appears, the light of the risen Lord,"" said the pope, who soon plans to visit the disaster zone in the Abruzzo region. He was presiding over the traditional Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession around Rome's Colosseum, commemorating Christ's crucifixion and death. Attended by tens of thousands of people, the solemn, night-time ceremony is one of the main services before Easter, the climax of the Christian year. In this year's ceremony, the pope listened to meditations that began by urging the faithful not to lose faith in trying times. They were written by Indian Archbishop Thomas Menamparampil. ""When misfortune hits us close to home, we grow disheartened. When we fall direct victims of a disaster, our self-confidence is totally shaken and our faith is put to the test. But all is not lost yet,"" Menamparampil wrote. Although composed before the disaster, the mediations took on special significance for a country grappling with its most deadly earthquake in three decades. ""Tragedies make us ponder. A tsunami tells us that life is serious. Hiroshima and Nagasaki remain pilgrim places,"" Menamparampil wrote in one of the meditations. ""When death strikes near, another world draws close. We then shed our illusions and have a grasp of the deeper reality."" Flags in Italy flew at half-mast on a national day of mourning on Friday, shops closed their shutters and airports halted take-offs, observing a minute's silence. Pope Benedict granted a special dispensation to allow a funeral for quake victims to be held earlier in the day in the mountain city of L'Aquila, the worst hit by the quake. Mass is not usually celebrated on Good Friday. The meditations also lamented all forms of violence, corruption, oppression and what Menamparampil said was an erosion of the public expression of religious life. Menamparampil, archbishop of Guwahati in northeast India, wrote: ""Jesus continues to suffer when believers are persecuted"". The German-born pope is leading the 1.1 billion-member Roman Catholic Church towards the fourth Easter of his pontificate. On Saturday, Benedict will say an Easter Eve mass and on Sunday will deliver an ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) blessing and message"
en.15.119.124.2009.4.15,Many Americans ignore food recalls: survey,"WASHINGTON, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Only about 60 percent of Americans search their homes for foods recalled because of contamination, researchers reported on Tuesday. The United States has had several major food recalls in recent years, including a Salmonella outbreak that sickened 700 people and was linked to the deaths of nine this year and an ongoing recall of pistachios contaminated with the bacteria. But a survey by Rutgers University in New Jersey showed that many Americans believe they are less likely than others to have bought recalled products. ""Getting consumers to pay attention to news about recalls isn't the hard part. It's getting them to take the step of actually looking for recalled food products in their homes,"" said William Hallman, a professor of human ecology who led the study. The Rutgers team surveyed 1,101 Americans in August and September of last year. ""Most Americans (84 percent) say that they pay close attention to news reports about food recalls and 81 percent say that when they hear about a food recall, they tell others about it,"" the report said. In 2006, there were 34 recalls of meat and poultry products and 65 recalls of other foods. The survey, found at www.foodpolicy.rutgers.edu, found that 80 percent correctly said that recalls of food were more frequent lately than in past years. It found that 40 percent of people who paid attention to recalls said they believed the foods they bought were less likely to be recalled than those purchased by others. About half said recalls have had no impact on their lives. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 76 million people become ill from food every year, with 325,000 sick enough to go to the hospital and 5,000 dying from food poisoning. ""While this suggests that nearly every American has experienced symptoms of a foodborne infection, only 18 percent of the respondents reported that they had ever been personally made sick as the result of eating contaminated food,"" the report said. Nearly 75 percent of those surveyed said they would like to receive personalized information about recalls on store receipts, and more than 60 percent said they also would also like to receive such information via letter or e-mail. Just 12 percent reported eating a food they thought had been recalled, while more than 25 percent said they threw out food after hearing about a recall. ""Our research also points out that instructions to consumers must be clear and comprehensible if you want them to act appropriately after a food recall,"" Hallman said in a statement. The study, funded by the US Department of Agriculture and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, suggested that instructions from regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration and USDA must be very clear and simple"

en.15.119.162.2009.4.16,China GDP slowest on record,"BEIJING, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's economy slowed in the first quarter to its weakest pace on record, but an improvement in data for March offered tentative signs that the worst may be over for the world's third-largest economy. Annual economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent from 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, slightly missing economists' forecasts of a 6.3 percent rise and marking the weakest expansion since quarterly records began in 1992. (For a graphic, click on: here) Growth was dragged down largely by a sharp fall in exports, but a surge in lending in the first quarter spurred by the government's 4 trillion yuan ($585 billion) stimulus package, helped cushion the blow. ""The overall national economy showed positive changes, with better performance than expected,"" Li Xiaochao, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said at a news conference on Thursday. Still, Li said the drop in exports was eroding corporate profits, reducing government revenues and making it harder to create jobs. ""The national economy is confronted with the pressure of a slowdown,"" he said. The yen gained against the dollar and other major currencies after the data, which prompted unwinding of trades by investors, who bought other currencies such as the Australian dollar and sterling, betting on a positive surprise. Commodities markets, which had already braced for a slowdown in the first quarter, took the news in stride. Oil and copper prices were little changed after the figures were released, holding on to earlier gains. Shares in Shanghai initially spiked to an eight-month high after the data only to give up the gains later. They traded 0.14 percent down at 11:35 p.m. EDT. Annual growth in urban fixed-asset investment surged unexpectedly to 28.6 percent in the first three months, while annual industrial output growth rebounded to 8.3 percent in March, from a record low 3.8 percent in the first two months of the year. Economists said there were no big surprises in the data, which confirmed a scenario of a gradual recovery in the latter part of the year, though they were divided over whether the government's 8 percent growth target for this year was still attainable. ""Overall, the data shows that China had a very weak start to the year, offset by some stabilization in economic conditions in March as the impact of policy stimulus starts to build,"" said Brian Jackson, economist at Royal Bank of Canada In Hong Kong. ""We think that the economy will remain subdued in the next few months but should start to improve gradually in the second half of 2009."" Still, the data kept market speculation alive that Beijing would top up its stimulus package with more spending, and economists warned that depressed global demand for Chinese-made goods would continue to weigh on the economy. ""The situation is still quite challenging as seen in the fall in the output of foreign-owned companies, which are mostly geared to exports,"" said Suan Teck Kin, economist at United Overseas Bank in Singapore, who sees full-year growth at 6.5 percent. In a sign that the economy still faces a bumpy ride in months ahead, the Shanghai Securities News reported that the decline in China's power consumption, a measure of economic activity, accelerated in the first 10 days of April. On a positive note, deflationary pressures also appeared to ease at the consumer level. Consumer prices fell 1.2 percent in March from a year earlier, in line with expectations and a less marked fall than in February. (For a graphic, click on: here) But the statistics agency said producer prices fell 6.0 percent in March from a year ago, a sharper drop than the 5.5 percent decline expected by economists polled by Reuters and also more severe than the 4.5 percent annual drop in February"

Finance minister AMA Muhith, speaking to reporters almost at the same time, was tight-lipped about the figure when pressed. Faruq Khan, the commerce minister, told reporters after a meeting with the Ireland's integration minister that the finance minister will speak about the financial package for the export-focused sectors hit by the global financial downturn. ""But the package is being considered in the region of Tk 2500-3000. On top of that, we are expecting assistance from the developed countries [for the export sectors] since the financial meltdown stemmed from them,"" Faruq said. Muhith said after a meeting with the representatives of the Association of Development Agencies Bangladesh (ADAB) at the Secretariat that new legislation would also be put in place to ensure the affected sectors get the financial support as fast as possible. ""The special package is almost at the final stages. It will be announced before Sheikh Hasina's Saudi tour,"" he told reporters Asked what the package would be worth, the minister said, ""That cannot be disclosed now."" A range of benefits will be included in the package for sectors being affected by the global recession, he said. The government was extending financial assistance to several export-oriented sectors including frozen food and textile. At present, the amount of outstanding money is more than Tk 1000 crore. However, the finance ministry waived Tk 243 crore in outstanding with the exporters several weeks ago. The new law will make sure that the exporters receive the money as soon as possible or there remains no outstanding amount, the minister added. The poultry industry will be given special priority in 2009-10 fiscal year, he said to the reporters after a meeting with Bangladesh Poultry Industries Association. Faruq Khan told reporters at his ministry the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh will be made more active to rein in the price of essentials on the eve of Ramadan. Asked about the sudden price hike of edible oil, he said, ""I believe the businessmen would not do that. We will tell them to keep the price reasonable. If they don't then government will take steps because we would not let people taken hostage by businessmen."" About the BDR mutiny, the minister, who coordinates the investigation committees, said, ""The investigation is going on very well. We want a thorough investigation. There is no point carrying out an investigation like the one of 'Judge Mia'. Otherwise this type of incidents will increase."" Questioned if it was possible to submit investigation report within the deadline, he said, ""The matter is being looked after by the home ministry. Meanwhile a draft report has been made.

Uday Bhaskar New Delhi, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If elections are the single most visible element of the democratic experience, the biggest show on earth is all set to unfold on Thursday when a large percentage of more than 700 million voters will participate in the first phase of the 15th Indian general elections to the Lok Sabha  the lower house of the Indian parliament. It is expected that up to 400 million Indians will cast their votes and yes, many of them are among the poorest of the poor  afflicted by what is euphemistically referred to as the 'DAD' syndrome  those who earn a dollar a day. But this in no way detracts from the excitement and enthusiasm with which the average Indian participates in the general election. As elections go, there is nothing to match the scale and diversity of these mega events and all kinds of statistical records and distinctive accomplishments are achieved. Elections are about who comes to power through the ballot box  but it also engenders the most vile, venal and reprehensible practices that range from intimidation and politically motivated killing of rival candidates to bribing and other forms of inducement. One hapless candidate, Vijay Bahadur Sonker of the little known Indian Justice Party who had entered the fray from Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh  India's most populous state - was found hanging from a tree on April 13. Earlier a candidate from Orissa was killed by local left wing extremists. But on balance, the Indian Election Commission does a highly commendable job over the one month long period  and the final phase will conclude in mid May when a new government will be in place in Delhi. The ballot does triumph over the bullet in India every five years and this resilience makes it a distinctive entity in the troubled southern Asian region. The principal contestation is between the Congress-led UPA coalition with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the helm (though Sonia Gandhi is the President of the Congress party and the main crowd puller) and the BJP-led NDA coalition whose PM in waiting is Lal Krishna Advani. In the run up to the voting on April 16, the campaigning and sloganeering has been shrill and no-holds-barred. The audio-visual medium provides a much wider cost-effective reach and TV debates are 24x7 in myriad languages. But it would be misleading to infer that TV is the only domain where the slug-fest is going on. Much of India is neither glued to TV or cyber-space savvy and ultimately the rural voter at the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum will determine who will form the government in Delhi. The key states will be Uttar Pradesh (80 seats), Maharashtra (48), Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal (42 each), Bihar (40) and Tamil Nadu (39) that between them contribute almost 54 percent of the 543 member Lok Sabha. Paradoxically, all these states have very strong regional parties and barring Andhra Pradesh where the Congress Party is in power currently, the two major national parties are on a weak wicket in these states. Hence the relevance of the regional party in these elections. Most pre-poll surveys indicate that neither the Congress nor the BJP is likely to cross the 150 mark individually and hence a coalition government is inevitable. Thus the birth of the 'third' and 'fourth' fronts which are a rainbow of regional and caste based groupings and they will be the critical 'swing' factor for forming the next government in Delhi. The paradox continues, for despite the global perception that India has now entered the league of major powers, no single national issue dominates the current election campaigns and manifestos. Employment and better socio-economic conditions encapsulated in the local jingles  'roti, paani, kapada, makaan, bijli, sadak' (bread, water, clothing, housing, electricity, roads)  are the dominant themes and all kinds of inducements are on offer. These include rice at Rs 2 per kilogram and other subsidies  the fiscal deficit be damned! On balance the elections will be free and fair and the penchant to play on identity  whether religion, caste or ethnicity will be strong. But the Indian voter is savvier with the passage of every such exercise and the communication revolution ranging from TV, radio and the mobile phone has introduced a level of connectivity and awareness that is unprecedented. Yet the ultimate challenge is to ensure that the conduct of robust and enthusiastically participatory elections translates into equitable and corruption-free governance. This Holy Grail has been elusive and hence the many distortions in the Indian democratic experience - but the contestation is a necessary first step and will be exhilarating. Watch this space! C.

""Despite the global economic slump, Bangladeshi expatriates sent a record $88.13 crore in remittance in March which is a great contribution to our economy,"" he said at a seminar on utilisation of remittance. ""But creating employment for returning workers at home is a big challenge ahead of the government,"" said the central banker. WB suggests extra million jobs The World Bank in a report Monday also suggested the government may need to create an extra one million new jobs to offset the effects of the world recession. ""At least 2 to 2.5 million new local jobs will be needed until the global economy recovers, compared to 1.1 million job creation prior to the crisis, "" Zahid Hussain, a senior economist of the World Bank, told reporters at the launch of the report. The Bangladeshi economy is currently stable but is vulnerable as the global economic slowdown threatens exports and remittances, said the report titled ""Bangladesh: State of the Economy and Policy Response to the Global Economic Crisis"". Facilities for returnees Meanwhile, the central bank boss highlighted the need for ensuring bank loans and other facilities for returnees so that they can return to a living back at home. He also urged local NGOs to maintain liaisons with overseas NGOs to assist expatriates in trouble. ""We must create labour markets in some new countries by creating and exporting more skilled and efficient workers,"" added Salehuddin. ""Remittance is the biggest foreign exchange earner."" ""But a big chunk of remittance makes its way back by illegal means due to high service charges,"" he said. The central bank boss stressed the need for a cut in service charges to encourage more inflow through legal channels. The governor was speaking as chief guest at the seminar on 'Organisational Support for Proper Utilisation of Remittance', organised by the International Network of Alternative Financial Institutions (INAFI) at the BRAC Centre Inn.

en.15.119.217.2009.4.16,Pakistan's Sharif says will not rejoin government,"ISLAMABAD, April 16 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - Pakistani opposition leader Nawaz Sharif declined on Thursday an offer for his party to join the cabinet, but said he would support the government in its struggle to fight militancy and revive the economy. Political tension in nuclear-armed Pakistan has eased considerably since last month, when the government, led by the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), gave in to opposition demands to reinstate a controversial Supreme Court chief. Tension was further eased when the Supreme Court cleared the way for Sharif's party, the country's second biggest, to resume as the governing party in Punjab, Pakistan's largest province and politically the most important. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani this week invited Sharif back into the coalition it left last year because of a dispute with the PPP over the judiciary. Sharif told reporters on Thursday his party would support the government, but would not be part of it. ""Without being part of the cabinet, in the government, we want to assure the government that we will support it like their own members do,"" he told reporters after meeting party leaders. GRAPPLING President Asif Ali Zardari and the government are grappling with rising Islamist militant violence and struggling to revive an economy propped up by a $7.6 billion International Monetary Fund loan. Analysts say the government wants Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) back in the coalition to share the burden, as well as the blame for any failings. Sharif, a former prime minister, said the country could not afford confrontational politics. Political wrangling also alarms the United States and other Western allies who want the government to focus on its economy and on fighting the militants. Polls show Sharif is Pakistan's most popular politician, partly because of his steadfast opposition to former army chief and president Pervez Musharraf and his support for the judiciary. Zardari, the widower of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, is much less popular and if his PPP is seen as having failed to solve the country's problems, Sharif's party would be set to win the next general election, due by 2013, analysts say. Sharif was dogged by accusations of corruption during his two terms as prime minister in the 1990s when he also clashed with the Supreme Court and sections of the media."
en.15.119.430.2009.4.12,Iran president dismisses demand to halt atom work: report,"TEHRAN, Sun Apr 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's president expressed openness for talks with the United States but again dismissed demands to halt nuclear work the West fears is aimed at making bombs, in an interview with Germany's Der Spiegel news magazine. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad also called for ""fundamental changes"" in Washington's policies, echoing comments by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other senior Iranian officials. ""If the behavior of the United States changes, we can expect to see important progress,"" he said in the interview posted on Der Spiegel's website, referring to decades of mistrust between Tehran and Washington. The new US administration of President Barack Obama, in a reversal of George W. Bush's approach, has offered a ""new beginning"" of diplomatic engagement if the Islamic Republic ""unclenches its fist."" Breaking with past US policy of shunning direct talks with Tehran, Washington last week said it would join discussions with Iran on its disputed nuclear program from now on. Der Spiegel said the interview was conducted about a week ago, before the United States and five other world powers said they would invite Iran to a meeting on the nuclear issue. An aide to Ahmadinejad has said Iran would review the offer. Iran has reacted cautiously to Washington's overtures, saying it wants to see a real shift in U.S. policy from the Bush administration, which spearheaded a drive to isolate Tehran over its refusal to stop enriching uranium. ""We support talks on the basis of fairness and respect. That has always been our position. We are waiting for Obama to announce his plans, so that we can analyze them,"" Ahmadinejad said in an English translation of the interview. ""We speak very respectfully of Barack Obama. But we are realists. We want to see real changes,"" he said. ""We feel that Obama must now follow his words with action."" While seeking to engage Iran, Obama's administration has also warned of tougher sanctions if it continues to defy United Nations demands to halt sensitive nuclear work. Ahmadinejad made clear once again Iran would not bow to such pressure and suspend uranium enrichment, which can have both civilian and military uses. ""These discussions are old. The time for this is over,"" he said. Turning to neighboring Afghanistan, he said Tehran was interested in ""helping correct a faulty"" US policy there. Obama announced his strategy for stabilizing Afghanistan and Pakistan on March 27, pledging additional troops to train Afghan forces and more civilians to spur Afghanistan's development. The United States now has about 38,000 troops in Afghanistan. Iran has often called on US forces to leave the region, saying their presence is making the security situation worse. ""I am telling you now that Obama's new policy is wrong,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""A stronger military presence (in Afghanistan) is not a solut"
en.15.119.67.2009.4.15,Book tells Beckham's LA story: from star to unknown,"NEW YORK, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England soccer player David Beckham was a superstar in Europe but when he moved to America a waiter demanded to see his ID and refused him a glass of wine, according to a book due out in July. ""The Beckham Experiment,"" by Sports Illustrated writer Grant Wahl, features interviews with 33-year-old Beckham and other major figures in Los Angeles Galaxy, the soccer team he joined in 2007 after a stellar career in Europe. The move to Los Angeles with his pop star wife Victoria Beckham was the latest chapter in a life story that has mixed celebrity with athletic prowess. Beckham signed a five-year deal worth an estimated $250 million and arrived in a blaze of publicity promising to help raise soccer's profile in America. But after an injury-plagued first season and a total of five goals during his time with the Galaxy, Beckham, 33, made clear earlier this year he preferred to play with Italian club AC Milan, where he is on loan. Household names in Britain and the rest of Europe, the Beckhams had struggled to translate their appeal to star-heavy Los Angeles and a celebrity media obsessed with the antics of Britney Spears and the expanding family of Angelina Jolie. Crown Publishing Group, a division of Random House that is part of Bertelsmann AG , said the book would provide an account of Beckham's ""celebrity packaging and the inner workings of a Beckham team."" ""Wahl provides a detailed account of Beckham's aspirations and worries about his American adventure, his interactions with Galaxy teammates making as little as $12,900 a year, his icy relationships with Galaxy star Landon Donovan and former team president Alexi Lalas,"" Crown said in a statement. It said it would also reveal the story of how Beckham's management company, 19 Entertainment, ""engineered a shadow takeover of Galaxy."" The book also features Beckham discussing the technique of his trademark bending free-kick goals, his marriage to the former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham and his relationship with celebrities such as Tom Cruise. Anecdotes include an occasion when Beckham was denied a glass of wine because he could not produce an ID document for a U.S. waiter who did not recognize him, Crown said. Many bars in the United States card people well over the age of 21, the legal age for drinking alcohol. Beckham is currently on loan to AC Milan until the end of the Serie A season. He will then return to the Galaxy before likely going back to Italy in November. Crown said the book would be published on July"
en.15.119.7.2009.4.10,Thai protests focus on summit,"BANGKOK, Fri Apr 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The focus of anti-government protests in Thailand switched to a summit of Asian leaders in a resort town on Friday after the prime minister's declaration of a public holiday helped ease disruption in the capital. Hoping it would be easier to control the demonstrations with fewer people in Bangkok, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva announced the holiday late on Thursday after taxi drivers began blocking major intersections in the sprawling capital. Thailand already had a holiday scheduled from April 13-15, when many rural anti-government protesters who have flooded into Bangkok were expected to go home. Media said Abhisit hoped the extra day would help take the heat out of the protests. One aim was to unclog the capital, where traffic was worse than what passes for normal on Thursday after taxi drivers joined red-shirted supporters of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra in their push for Abhisit's resignation. The pro-Thaksin Union Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD) had said the protests would end, temporarily at least, by the weekend, but it hardened its tone on Friday. ""This fight will end only when the 'red shirts' win or the government wins,"" one UDD leader, Jatuporn Prompan, told a news conference in Bangkok. Abhisit said in a televised address on Thursday he wanted to ease the inconvenience to the public caused by the protests, and make it easier to identify troublemakers. He said he would not give in to demands to step down made by Thaksin, ousted in a military coup in 2006. Thaksin, a telecommunications billionaire, lives in self-imposed exile, but his absence has not healed the divisions between the royalist, military and business elite, who say he was corrupt, and the poor who benefited from his populist policies. For the government, one immediate priority was security at a summit of 16 Asian leaders gathering on Friday in Pattaya, a resort town 150 km (90 miles) southeast of Bangkok. Any violence played out in front of the television cameras at the summit could scare off foreign investors, who have only recently dipped back into the Thai stock market. Despite the holiday, financial markets opened as usual on Friday. The stock market followed Wall Street higher at first, then turned lower, with investors worried about how the protests might develop over the break. ""If things become disrupted, that will seriously affect investment sentiment,"" said Sukit Udomsirikul, a senior analyst with Siam City Securities. Canceled The summit was canceled last year because of political unrest when a pro-Thaksin government was in power. Abhisit's administration has billed the rescheduled event as a sign that Thailand was returning to normal. Several thousand demonstrators turned up in Pattaya and easily pushed through several checkpoints before halting just outside the hotel where the summit is being held. For the most part, the protests remained peaceful. One group of ""red shirts"" who had blocked Silom Road in Bangkok turned and ran when some women came out of an office block and shouted abuse at them. They left behind a red flag that the women burned. The mass protest began on Wednesday, with 100,000 people in a sea of red around Abhisit's office at Government House. On Friday the early numbers were put by police at no more than 5,000. Some protesters had moved to other focus points, including Victory Monument, a landmark that is also one of the busiest road junctions in the capital. Around 1,000 protesters were at the intersection on Friday, erecting tents to provide shelter. UDD leaders said they might move back to Government House later in the day, but only if there was no attack on their people in Pattaya. Suraphon Pangkaew, a 55-year-old from Chonburi in the east, said he didn't care what Abhisit had said because he was not the legitimate leader -- a constant refrain from Thaksin supporters. Abhisit became premier in December, after a pro-Thaksin government was dismissed by the courts, and was elected by parliament with the help of defectors from the Thaksin camp. ""They said they want to enforce the law upon us. They didn't do that with PAD, so this is unfair,"" Suraphon said. PAD -- the People's Alliance for Democracy -- waged a street campaign for months to undermine successive pro-Thaksin governments last year. It closed down Bangkok's two main airports for a week in late 2008, devastating the tourism indu"

Thousands of mourners gathered before 205 coffins, many of them covered by flowers and photos of the dead, laid out in rows on the parade ground of a police academy in the mountain city of L'Aquila, the worst hit by Monday's 6.3 magnitude quake. Small white caskets with the bodies of children lay on their parents' coffins, some with a favorite toy placed on top. ""There is a lot of sadness today, but also a lot of anger,"" said Piero Faro, who came to pay his respects to family friend Paola Pugliesi, 65, who died with her son Giuseppe, 45. ""Their building simply disintegrated. This should not have happened."" Some mourners kissed the coffins and were comforted by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi before a Catholic mass conducted by the second highest priest in the Vatican, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone. The ceremony began with a message from Pope Benedict. ""In these dramatic hours when a fearful tragedy has blighted this land, I feel spiritually present in your midst and share your anguish,"" said the message from the pope. Flags flew at half mast around Italy on a national day of mourning, shops lowered their shutters or turned off lights and traffic wardens removed their brightly-colored jackets. Five days after the earthquake, rescuers were still digging bodies from the rubble, with a 53-year-old woman and her teenage daughter found dead in the wreckage of their home overnight. But the Civil Protection agency, which is coordinating Italy's response to the crisis, said the search was almost over. Violent aftershocks, some felt in nearby Rome, continued to shake Abruzzo region overnight, damaging buildings in medieval towns and terrifying the 17,000 people living in tent villages. Thousands more survivors are being put up in hotels. ""OUR DEAD"" ""We thank the people of Abruzzo for their seriousness, civility, dignity and composure,"" said Berlusconi. ""Today we pay homage to their dead, who are our dead."" Attention is now starting to turn to the reconstruction of a region that relies on tourism, farming and family firms. Italy's industry minister said more than half of the companies in Abruzzo ""are no longer producing."" One estimate put the damage at up to 3 billion euros ($4 billion), but its impact on Italy's nearly 2-trillion-euro economy, already mired in recession, is expected to be limited. Berlusconi, who has dubbed L'Aquila a ""ghost town,"" said the country would receive up to 500 million euros from an EU fund to help cover some of the reconstruction bills. The government plans to suspend some tax, utility and phone bills in the affected areas and has earmarked 100 million euros for rescue, relief and reconstruction efforts. Italian banks may also suspend mortgage payments and bank charges for survivors. The government has also announced an enquiry. President Giorgio Napolitano on Thursday said shoddy construction was to blame for the collapse of modern buildings, including a hospital and student hostel, that should have been earthquake-proof. ""People need to search their consciences,"" he said. Local builders, however, said some of the damage would prove to be superficial. ""We are not killers,"" said builder Filiberto Cicchetti. ""Ninety percent of private housing built outside the city walls from the '60s on is still viable ... The city will be reb"
en.15.119.353.2009.4.10,Japan extends sanctions on North Korea after missile,"TOKYO, Fri Apr 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan will extend by a year economic sanctions against North Korea, including a ban on imports, and tighten oversight of fund transfers to its secretive neighbor after a rocket launch, the government said on Friday. Pyongyang said it had put a satellite into orbit but Tokyo, Seoul and Washington consider last Sunday's launch a thinly disguised test of a long-range missile designed to carry a warhead as far as Alaska. The US military has said no object entered orbit. In a largely symbolic measure, Japan will extend existing sanctions for a year and require more money sent to the cash-strapped communist country to be reported to authorities. Sanctions previously set for six months have been extended four times since they began in 2006, with Japan citing lack of progress in talks to denuclearize the North and to investigate Pyongyang's past abduction of Japanese citizens. ""We have not seen a sincere response from North Korea on the issues of abductions, nuclear programs and missiles,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura told a news conference. ""We decided that additional measures were also needed, taking into consideration the overall situation after the missile launch."" Japan's unpopular government is under pressure to take a tough stance against North Korea after its rocket soared over Japan during its 2,000-mile flight. Japan has called for a fresh, legally binding resolution by the U.N. Security Council to declare Pyongyang in violation of a previous resolution banning the firing of ballistic missiles. But Russia and China, permanent veto-wielding council members, have opposed the move, unconvinced the rocket launch was a violation. Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone told reporters he and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had agreed by telephone earlier on Friday to work together to seek a new Security Council resolution. But UN diplomats said Washington has indicated it might be willing to accept a nonbinding statement rather than a resolution, which the Americans fear could take too long, if one can be agreed at all. A nonbinding statement would likely be seen as diplomatic failure for Japan at home, where Prime Minister Taro Aso is struggling with low voter support ahead of an election this year. Aso leaves on Friday for a summit of 16 Asian countries in Thailand, where diplomats say Japan will push for leaders to issue a statement about North Korea's rocket la"
en.15.119.87.2009.4.10,US Treasury asking banks keep quiet on stress tests,"WASHINGTON, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US Treasury Department is asking banks not to mention the regulatory `stress tests' as part of their first-quarter earnings results, according to a source familiar with government discussions. Many of the top 19 US banks who are undergoing regulatory stress tests have already completed internal versions of the examinations, which are designed to determine their capital needs under more adverse economic conditions. However, the banks do not yet know the results of the government's version of the assessment, the source said. US President Barack Obama is meeting on Friday with top financial regulators to discuss the stress tests, the results of which are anxiously anticipated by financial markets. Officials have said they will release the results in some form by the end of April. Most major US banks will have reported their first-quarter results by April 24. The source said the desire to keep the stress test results under wraps will be discussed at the meeting on Friday. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair are scheduled to attend the meeting, as well as top White House economic adviser Larry Summers, US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro, and US Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan. The regulators are expected to brief Obama on the progress of the stress tests, and discuss what next steps may be necessary after the tests. In an attempt to assess banks' capital needs, the government is testing how they would fare under more adverse economic conditions than are expected. The markets are anxiously anticipating the results to see which firms get a clean bill of health and which firms will likely need more taxpayer help. Some of those market fears were soothed on Thursday when Wells Fargo & Co, the No. 4 US bank, said it expected to post a record $3 billion first-quarter profit, causing its shares to soar 31.7 percent and lifting other bank stocks. Once the stress tests are finalized and the capital needs are determined, banks will have six months to raise capital in the private market or could take an infusion of government funds. The government plan to use public-private investment funds to soak up the banks' toxic assets will be another recovery program available to those banks in need. Officials are still discussing how to release the results of the stress tests, and the decision will likely be made by the Treasury, a source familiar with official talks said. The source said officials are aiming to release them in some form at the end of April after the first-quarter bank earnings season is over, and are trying to be sensitive to financial market reac"
en.15.119.456.2009.4.14,Somali militants fire at US lawmaker,"MOGADISHU, Apr 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somalia's militant Islamist rebel group al Shabaab said Monday it fired mortars at a plane carrying a US lawmaker, a day after US snipers killed three Somali pirates and freed the American ship captain they had been holding hostage. An al Shabaab spokesman said his group fired at the plane carrying Representative Donald Payne as he left the anarchic Horn of Africa country following a rare one-day visit by a US official. Payne's plane took off safely and no-one was hurt. The successful rescue of Captain Richard Phillips, who had been held by pirates for five days in a drifting lifeboat after their attempt to hijack the US-flagged container ship Maersk Alabama failed, was hailed in the United States as a ""feel-good"" story that temporarily lifted the country's spirits in gloomy economic times. Three US snipers each fired a single shot virtually simultaneously, each killing his target. A fourth pirate was captured alive. The successful conclusion boosted President Barack Obama, who had authorized the US navy to use force if the commander on the spot felt Phillips's life was in danger. Obama, in brief comments Monday, called Phillips a hero and reiterated that he was resolved to work with other countries to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia. ""We're going to have to continue to work with our partners to prevent future attacks,"" Obama said. ""We have to continue to be prepared to confront them when they arise."" More than 250 hostages of many nationalities are still being held along the Somali coast by pirates who have seized dozens of vessels, from tankers to yachts, in recent months. Helicopters once again flew over pirate bases near Eyl on the Somali coast overnight after Phillips' rescue. ""They killed our friends on the lifeboat and we thought helicopters would bomb us in Eyl last night,"" a pirate in Eyl, who called himself Farah, told Reuters. ""We were mourning for dead friends and then roaring planes came -- grief upon grief. America has become our new enemy."" Al Shabaab, which condemns both piracy and anti-piracy patrols by international navies off Somalia, said the attack on Payne's plane was a message to the United States but did not directly link it to the hostage issue. ENCOURAGE PROSECUTION State Department spokesman Robert Wood said Washington was encouraging states to prosecute suspected pirates and working with the shipping industry to avoid future hijacks. He cautioned that the problem would not be solved overnight. Responding to threats by the pirates' to kill foreign hostages in retaliation for the rescue, Wood said: ""These folks are bandits. They're lawless."" Phillips was the first American taken by pirates who have plundered ships in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean for years. The US Navy said the decision to shoot his kidnappers was a split-second one, taken because he appeared to be in imminent danger. ""They were pointing the AK-47s at the captain,"" Vice Admiral William Gortney, head of the US Naval Central Command, said. Phillips contacted his family after the rescue, received a medical check, and rested aboard the USS Boxer. His crew set off flares, hoisted an American flag and jumped for joy at the news of their captain's rescue. They called on Obama to take the lead in combating piracy. The Maersk Alabama, carrying food aid for the region, was attacked far out in the Indian Ocean Wednesday, but its 20 American crew regained control. Phillips volunteered to go with the pirates in a lifeboat in exchange for the crew's safety. So far, pirates have generally treated hostages well, sometimes roasting goat meat for them and even letting them phone loved ones. The worst violence has been the occasional beating. No hostages are known to have been killed by pir"
en.15.119.92.2009.4.12,Shots fired as Thai protesters storm ministry,"BANGKOK, Sun Apr 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Troops fired into the air as Thai anti-government protesters stormed the country's interior ministry on Sunday after Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva declared a state of emergency in the capital. About 50 protesters broke through security at the interior ministry in Bangkok while Abhisit was in the building, but the prime minister escaped by car, a TV channel said. Reuters journalists at the scene said soldiers initially made no effort to stop the protesters from entering the building but later fired into the air to prevent more from joining them. Red-shirted protesters were also gathering at the capital's police headquarters while a crowd at Government House had grown to over 4,000. The latest unrest comes a day after protesters stormed the venue of a summit of Asian leaders, forcing the event to be cancelled and seriously undermining confidence in the government. In a weekly address to the nation, Abhisit said arrest warrants were being drawn up for those responsible for the unrest. Police said they had already arrested Arismun Pongreungrong, a popular singer prominent in the summit assault, and were holding him at a police station north of Bangkok. ""In the current situation, what I have to do is to bring peace to the country, bring back governance and have a process of political reform,"" Abhisit said. POLITICAL HUMILIATION Abhisit suffered a political humiliation when the summit he had presented as a sign of the country's return to normality had to be cancelled after red-shirted supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra broke into the venue, sending Asian leaders fleeing by helicopter. Thaksin's supporters say Abhisit only became premier because of a parliamentary stitch-up engineered by the army. They want new elections, which they would be well placed to win. The events will pile more pressure on an economy teetering on the brink of recession, especially if foreign tourists are put off by the scenes of chaos. Thai financial markets are closed until Thursday for a holiday. After months of falls, many Asian stock markets have rallied in recent weeks but the Thai market has been held back by the political unrest and is flat on the year. Patareeya Benjapolchai, president of the Stock Exchange of Thailand, was concerned. ""It's really up to the government now how it manages the situation within this five-day break. What happened was a loss for the country. The ASEAN summit was supposed to be a step-up for our economy,"" Patareeya told Reuters. Newspapers were outraged both by the pro-Thaksin supporters' insult to foreign leaders and by the government's inability to put proper security in place. Police and soldiers put up little resistance as the demonstrators marched towards the summit hotel. ""Yesterday was a truly shameful day for our country, which had its international image destroyed,"" the Bangkok Post said in a front-page edito"

en.15.119.185.2009.4.16,GM pushes faster plan to cut US dealers: sources,"DETROIT, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - General Motors Corp has told US dealers it is accelerating its timetable for closing about 1,700 dealerships as it rushes to meet a June 1 deadline to restructure under US government oversight, people with knowledge of the discussions said. In a series of meetings with key dealers including representatives of the National Automobile Dealers Association, GM executives also said about 200 dealerships had closed in the first quarter, according to people briefed on those talks. The sources asked not to be named because of the sensitive nature of GM's discussions with its cash-strapped dealers. Dealer representatives met on Tuesday in Detroit with GM Chief Executive Fritz Henderson and on Wednesday with GM sales chief Mark LaNeve, the sources said. A GM spokesman confirmed that the meetings had taken place but declined to comment on the closed-door discussions. Separately, Chrysler LLC executives, including sales chief Jim Press, held a conference call for dealers on Tuesday and met with key dealers on Wednesday, sources said. ""The message was that all the balls are in the air, but they were committed to trying to reach a deal with Fiat,"" one Chrysler dealer who participated in the briefing said. Chrysler could not be immediately reached for comment. Both embattled automakers were meeting with dealers, with just weeks remaining to hammer out new concessionary deals with creditors and their major union under the threat of a government-sponsored bankruptcy. Chrysler has until the end of April to conclude a deal with Italy's Fiat SpA and win other needed concessions. GM has been given until June 1 to attempt its own out-of-court restructuring by US officials. GM dealers who met with executives in Detroit this week were told that the automaker has several interested potential investors in its troubled Hummer SUV brand and expected to have an offer that would keep the brand running, one of the people familiar with the discussions said. GM's Henderson had said in late March that a decision on Hummer could come within weeks. Henderson took over as CEO when the government ousted Rick Wagoner amid criticism he had moved too slowly on the automaker's restructuring. HOT BUTTON ISSUE The issue of how many US dealerships GM can support has been one of the hot-button issues for US officials as they drive GM toward a stepped-up restructuring that many observers have now concluded will include a bankruptcy filing. GM ended 2008 with over 6,200 dealers in the United States and had presented a plan to the US autos task force, run by former investment banker Steve Rattner, that would have cut that by about 25 percent to near 4,100 over the next five years as dealers shut down or merged. The task force rejected GM's dealer consolidation plan as one element of a turnaround that officials said did not go far enough or move fast enough. Since delivering that verdict on GM's plan late last month, the autos task force has told the automaker to go to work on an expedited dealer consolidation plan that would not rely on attrition alone, people briefed on those discussions said. As a result, GM officials have told dealers that they would identify underperforming locations and could move to terminate franchise agreements by June 1, a dealer who had received such a notice said on Wednesday. GM is counting on the spin-off or closure of its Saturn and Hummer brands -- combined with dealership closures because of declining business conditions and tight credit -- to deliver about half of its targeted cuts, according to the dealer. For the remainder, GM is preparing to terminate franchise agreements without the kind of payouts that it made when it shut down its Oldsmobile division and closed some 2,800 dealerships. That process cost GM more than $1 billion. Representatives of US auto dealers, including the NADA trade group, have met at least four times with members of the US autos task force since last month, including discussions of the financing pressure on both dealers and car shoppers, the sources said"
en.15.119.388.2009.4.12,Real IRA threaten to take campaign to Britain: report,"DUBLIN, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A dissident nationalist group in Northern Ireland will carry out armed attacks in mainland Britain as part of its campaign for a united Ireland, its representative said in a newspaper interview on Sunday. The Real IRA, a splinter paramilitary group of the Irish Republican Army, also claimed responsibility for the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, a former Sinn Fein chief administrator and spy for the British, and made threats against Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuiness. Sinn Fein is the political wing of the IRA and McGuiness was a senior IRA commander in the 1970s. In the interview with Ireland's Sunday Tribune the Real IRA representative said it planned to attack Britain ""when it becomes opportune."" The Real IRA, thought to a small group with only marginal support from the Catholic community, has previously shown it can carry out such threats. In 2000 it launched an audacious missile attack on the London headquarters of Britain's foreign espionage agency MI6. No one was hurt in the assault, but it was a propaganda coup. The Real IRA, which has already claimed responsibility for killing two British soldiers outside Northern Ireland's Massereene Barracks on March 7 this year, said it would also continue to target soldiers in the British province. ""Orlaigh na hEireann will continue to strike at the British occupation forces wherever and whenever we decide,"" he added, using the Irish name the group refers to itself as. The Real IRA split from the IRA in 1997 over that group's involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process, which in 1998 ended 30 years of fighting between minority Irish Republican Catholics and pro-British protestants which killed more than 3,600 people. The Massereene attacks were the worst since the peace deal. The newspaper said the group will publicly admit on Sunday to killing Donaldson at a commemoration of the Easter Rising, the 1916 insurrection staged in Ireland against British rule. Donaldson was shot dead in April 2006, four months after he admitted to being a long-serving British spy, and no group claimed responsibility for his murder. ""We always intended to claim the operation but we wanted to wait until we had first executed crown force personnel. That was secured at Massereene,"" the spokesman said. ""The days of a campaign involving military operations every day or every few days, are over. We're looking for high-profile targets, though we'll obviously take advantage when other targets present themselves,"" he said. The newspaper said the group will also threaten McGuiness, who denounced last month's attack as well as the killing of a policeman by another splinter group, the Continuity IRA. ""Let us remind our former comrade (McGuiness) of the nature and actions of a traitor,"" read a printed version of the statement, referring to what happened to Donaldson. ""No traitor will escape justice regardless of time, rank or past actions. The republican movement has a long memory."" The statement also threatened members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI)"

""We, our brothers and sisters, are seekers of peace and stability and we do not want our country to live under the shadows of swords and tension,"" President Omar Hassan al-Bashir said at the opening of the eighth session of parliament. ""Our hands remain held out to those who call for peace and justice in accordance with the standards of fairness and dignity,"" he added, echoing a phrase used by Obama in his inauguration address. ""We even welcome the positive signs sent by US President Barack Obama to the Islamic world on more than one occasion."" Washington has had tense relations with the Islamist government of Bashir, who came to power in Africa's largest country in a 1989 coup. The United States imposed economic sanctions on Sudan in 1997 and labeled it a ""state sponsor of terrorism."" Ties were strained further by the conflict in Darfur, which both Obama and his predecessor George W. Bush have called genocide, a description Sudan's government rejects. Bashir also used his speech Monday to defend a decision to expel 13 foreign aid agencies from Darfur last month after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes in Sudan's western region. He said the decision was made ""for the sake of protecting the sovereignty, security and independence of our country."" Bashir's comments came after a visit to Sudan this month by Obama's special envoy to the country, Scott Gration, who met officials from the government, rebel groups and international organizations, promising to ""look, learn and listen."" Gration, who is expected to return to Sudan within months, said he was looking for friendship and cooperation from the Sudanese government but he did sound one note of criticism. After visiting a refugee camp in Darfur, he said he was concerned the region was on the brink of a deeper humanitarian crisis following the expulsion of the aid agencies. Gration's predecessor Richard Williamson, appointed by Bush, suspended talks on normalizing relations with Sudan last year, saying northern and southern Sudanese leaders were not serious about reconciling after a decades-long civil war. International experts say at least 200,000 people have been killed and more than 2.7 million driven from their homes in almost six years of ethnic and politically driven fighting in Darfur. Khartoum says 10,000 people have"

Manager Arsene Wenger confirmed to reporters on Thursday that the knee ligament damage Gallas suffered during his side's 1-1 draw at Villarreal meant he would play no further part in Arsenal's assault on the Champions League and FA Cup trophies. Gallas was injured when he collided with Villarreal striker Giuseppe Rossi shortly before half-time. Arsenal will also be without goalkeeper Manuel Almunia for three weeks due to an ankle injury which he suffered in Tuesday's match in a collision with Rossi while full-back Gael Clichy will miss two weeks with a back injury. Almunia's absence means that second-choice goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, who replaced Almunia after 27 minutes in Spain, will have an extended run in the team for the first time this season.

en.15.119.248.2009.4.16,"Pakistan vows action on economy, security for aid","TOKYO, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan can restore economic growth and is committed to fighting extremism, its foreign minister said on Wednesday, as the cash-strapped country eyes $4 billion in aid from allies gathering in Tokyo this week. Delegates meeting on Friday want to hear assurances that Pakistan is focused on implementing economic reforms and fighting an increasingly formidable Islamist insurgency as they set to pledge aid to fill a financing gap over the next two years. The international community is worried that an economic meltdown in the nuclear-armed country, which narrowly averted a balance of payment crisis last year, could fan popular support for al Qaeda and other militant groups. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said he was confident of donors pledging funds and added that the support, along with economic policies in place, would help push economic growth to 6 to 7 percent. The central bank has forecast growth for the 2008/09 fiscal year ending in June at 2.5-3.5 percent. ""What we have in front of us is a huge agenda,"" Qureshi told a news conference in Tokyo. ""A huge agenda of economic stabilisation, an agenda of defeating terrorism, reversing extremism and a political agenda of strengthening political and democratic institutions of Pakistan."" Pakistan is central to U.S. President Barack Obama's plan for south Asia which includes trying to stabilise Afghanistan, where Taliban militants, many operating from lawless northwest Pakistani enclaves, have thrown U.S. success into doubt. In Pakistan, a hotchpotch of militant groups, many operating from those same enclaves on the Afghan border and looking to al Qaeda for leadership, have sown fear with regular suicide attacks and are increasingly challenging the writ of the state. While violence has intensified, high oil and food costs battered Pakistan's economy last year and it only averted a balance of payments crisis when, in November, it secured an IMF loan package of $7.6 billion over two years. NO ""CHRISTMAS PARTY"" Motohide Yoshikawa, Japan's special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, told Reuters in an interview that Tokyo and other donors wanted a clear commitment from Pakistan on economic reform and fighting militants. ""This is not a Christmas party,"" he said. ""Those who receive have their own obligations and those who have made pledges have obligations to pay what they promise."" Pakistan will outline its medium-term strategies to fight insurgency and revive its economy at a Friends of Pakistan group meeting on Friday morning. In the afternoon, those friends, who include the United States, Japan, China and Saudi Arabia, will join other donors to promise aid for the next two years. ""This is a whole bunch of people coming together to express support for Pakistan but concern about the direction that things are going,"" US Senator John Kerry told reporters in Islamabad late on Tuesday. ""It's important that there be significant aid put on the table to underscore the importance of this effort. I think there will be,"" said Kerry, who is sponsoring a bill to triple US development aid to Pakistan to $1.5 billion a year. Pakistani Finance Ministry chief Shaukat Tarin said this week the target of $4 billion over two years was for spending on poverty alleviation, education and health. Those sectors have suffered under efforts to cut the fiscal deficit. At the Friends meeting, Pakistan is expected to present a prioritised wish-list of projects worth $30 billion that it wants to see implemented over 10 years, including hydro dams, roads and security projects. Pakistan's ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani said last week his government wanted a ""Marshall Plan"", referring to massive US spending in Europe after World War"

BBC News profiles the main players. MANMOHAN SINGH Prime minister since Congress's election victory in 2004. Despite recent ill health - he took weeks off work after his third round of heart surgery this year - Congress have continued to back him as their candidate. Mild-mannered former academic and bureaucrat, 78, who made his political reputation as the architect of India's financial reforms in the 1990s. Criticised by some for his gentle, conciliatory leadership style. Pushed through landmark nuclear deal with US, though lost support of Communist allies in process. Has never won a popular election, but enjoys widespread support because of reputation as one of India's cleanest politicians. LK ADVANI Firebrand, 81-year-old leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Remembered for leading the campaign that led to the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque in 1992 by Hindu extremists. Has since tried to shed his hard-line image, reaching out to younger voters and launching a blog, but is seen as hostage to the BJP's continuing Hindu nationalist politics. Angered support base with trip to Pakistan in 2005. Credited with overseeing the rise of the BJP as a major political force. Served as deputy prime minister under Atal Behari Vajpayee until 2004, before leading his party in opposition. Reputation as an efficient and ruthless administrator. SONIA GANDHI Italian-born president of Congress party. Widow of murdered former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and current leader of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. Eschewed politics after Rajiv's 1991 killing before stepping up to lead the party in 1998. Elected to parliament the following year. Turned down post of prime minister after leading Congress to a surprise election victory in 2004. Seen as de facto ruler whose influence over the party has never been in doubt. Critics have questioned her political management skills and ability to manage crises within the Congress-led coalition. Opponents' attempts to focus on her foreign origin seen to have failed. RAHUL GANDHI Son of Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi and general secretary of Congress. Seen as being groomed to take over from Manmohan Singh at the head of a Congress-led coalition. Member of parliament for the family constituency of Amethi since 2004. Initially refused to take up a leading position in Congress, but now seen to play an increasingly prominent role. Party looking to him to revive its hopes by attracting new generation of voters.

NARENDRA MODI Key BJP figure, chief minister of Gujarat since 2001. Powerful and charismatic, popular among BJP supporters. Criticised for failing to stem anti-Muslim violence in which more than 1,000 people were killed in 2002. Resigned in aftermath of riots, but campaigned for re-election later that year on openly hard-line Hindu nationalist platform. Seen as business friendly and credited with bringing increased prosperity to Gujarat. Modi is a popular writer and a poet in Gujarati and Hindi, as well as a fire-eater. Said to enjoy strong support among senior leaders of the right-wing Hindu Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which serves as ideological fountainhead for BJP.

Became India's first Dalit chief minister when elected at head of a coalition with the BJP in Uttar Pradesh state in 2007. Could now emerge at the head of a ""third front"" in India if both main coalitions fail to gain enough seats. Has recently softened her anti-upper-caste rhetoric as she seeks to broaden her support base, fielding dozens of upper-caste and Muslim candidates in 2007. Critics complain that her multi-million dollar personal wealth - she is known for her fondness of diamonds and lavish birthday parties - jars with her status as champion of India's poor. SHARAD PAWAR One of India's most powerful politicians, an on-off ally of Congress. Head of the Maharashtra-based Nationalist Congress Party, known to have long harboured national ambitions. Head of the Indian cricket board, a position of considerable influence in a cricket-loving country.

CHANDRABABU NAIDU President of the Telegu Desam Party (TDP), a key BJP ally, since 1995. Chief minister of Andhra Pradesh from 1995 to 2004. Seen as one of India's most dynamic politicians, who helped turn the state capital, Hyderabad, into an information-technology hub. Believes in what he calls ""electronic governance"" to cut through the red tape of bureaucracy. But critics say he neglected the rural poor, and did not do enough to quash Maoist rebels powerful in some parts of the state, who came close to assassinating him shortly before he left office. Seen to harbour national political ambitions. NITISH KUMAR Chief minister of Bihar and former minister of transport and agriculture. Heads an alliance of the Janata Dal United party and the BJP, which holds a clear majority in the state. His victory in November 2005 ended 15 years of rule by the charismatic Laloo Prasad Yadav, leader of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, a key Congress ally.

Some 20,000 people demonstrated on Monday outside parliament in the former Soviet republic, the fifth day of their protest. The opposition leaders said they would keep up continuous protests until Saakashvili quit over his record on democracy and last year's disastrous war with Russia. ""That way he will hear our voices much more loudly,"" said Kakha Kukava, one of more than a dozen opposition leaders taking part in the campaign. Turnout dipped over the weekend and there were signs that some opposition leaders were looking to hold talks with the president on finding a way out of the stand-off. Some 60,000 people rallied at the start of the campaign on Thursday, followed by 20,000 on Friday, blocking Tbilisi's central avenue and the main roads running past the president's office and the public broadcaster. Critics accuse Saakashvili, who came to power on the back of the 2003 Rose Revolution, of monopolizing power and exerting pressure on the judiciary and the media. Last year's war, when Russia crushed a Georgian assault on breakaway South Ossetia, has emboldened opponents who say the 41-year-old leader has made too many mistakes to remain in power until 2013. But analysts doubt the opposition can remain united or muster the numbers over a sustained period to force him out. Despite the defection of some senior allies and repeated cabinet reshuffles since the war, Saakashvili's position appears to remain strong. The West, which receives oil via Georgia from the Caspian Sea, is watching the situation closely. In November 2007, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the last peaceful mass demonstrations against Saakashvili. Diplomats say a protracted stand-off risks sparking unrest. The European Union's special envoy for the South Caucasus, Peter Semneby, has been trying to broker a dialogue but opposition leaders have sent mixed signals about their readiness to talk. ""People like Semneby have been talking to them,"" a senior government source told Reuters. ""There are stirrings, but they haven't settled on anything"

India's test series win in New Zealand this week was their first in four decades. It was also their third successive test series victory since beating top-ranked Australia in November. ""This team is capable of winning anywhere,"" Harbhajan told Reuters in an interview on Friday. ""If we play to our potential, stick to the basics and focus on the job, we have the team that can beat anyone anywhere."" India defeated Australia and England in back-to-back series at home last year and are once again considered a true force in world cricket. India have yet to win a test series in Australia, although they squared a close series 1-1 in 2004 and lost a controversial test series 2-1, before winning a tri-series last year. India won their first test in South Africa in 2006 and emerged surprise winners of the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup there two years ago. The 28-year-old bowler said winning matches overseas has made a big difference. ""The guys are confident, confident of performing in any conditions,"" said Harbhajan, the side's main spinner since Anil Kumble retired last year. ""I think this team can win anywhere -- South Africa, Australia -- we have got the ability to exploit any conditions."" Harbhajan is his country's second most successful spinner and emerged the highest wicket-taker in New Zealand with 16 wickets. BEST YET? Their success streak, including a 1-0 win over England, has triggered debate in the cricket-mad country as to whether the current side are the best yet. India are ranked third behind Australia and South Africa in the test rankings and the batting-heavy team has found a potent new ball pair in the wily Zaheer Khan and quick Ishant Sharma. The pair have played a significant role in the last three series victories and are regarded as the best new ball pair in the business. ""Zaheer has bowled beautifully to give India early breakthroughs,"" Harbhajan said of the left-armer. ""Ishant is still raw, and he needs to be focused. He is a talented bowler."" Harbhajan, who has taken 330 test wickets and over 200 one-day wickets, did not get drawn into the debate of whether the team is India's best yet. ""I won't want to compare between eras,"" said Harbhajan. ""But a batting like up of (Virender) Sehwag, Gautam (Gambhir) ... (Rahul) Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, (Vangipurappu) Laxman, Yuvraj (Singh)... I'd say it is one of the best. It's an exciting team."

Indian foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon made the offer came at his meetings with foreign minister Dipu Moni and his counterpart Md Touhid Hossain Monday. The foreign minister expressed Dhaka's concern about the controversial project that it could deprive Bangladesh of its share of the international river that supplied waters to hundreds of water bodies in the region. Menon arrived in Dhaka Sunday on an unannounced and unscheduled visit to take part in an ""ongoing dialogue between friends, between neighbours"". He left on Monday afternoon. ""They (India) are trying to allay our concerns about the Tipaimukh dam,"" Touhid told reporters after meeting Menon. ""He (Menon) told me that Bangladesh should send a delegation comprising technical and political people to witness the project."" The foreign secretary added that Dhaka would make a decision later. ""On water, for instance, there were some concerns expressed and I said we would be very happy to receive a delegation from Bangladesh to show them exactly what is happening, what we planned,"" Menon told reporters after meetings with Dipu Moni, her deputy Hasan Mahmud, and Touhid. ""What we planned is a river project which will not affect the downstream flows at all,"" ""This is a part of the ongoing dialogue between friends, between neighbours, it is natural we will keep discussing the issues finding ways forward,"" he said. India in 2003 initiated the move to construct a dam over the cross-boundary river Barak which enters into Bangladesh through Sylhet region before meeting the Meghna. It started the construction by the end of last year without consulting Bangladesh. Bangladesh gets 7 to 8 percent of its total water from the Barak in India's northeastern states. Millions of people are dependent on hundreds of water bodies, fed by the Barak, in the Sylhet region for fishing and agricultural activities. Environmentalists in Bangladesh have held many talks on the adverse impact of the proposed dam. They say the dam would dry up the river and the water bodies in the downstream, leaving millions jobless. India dismisses the claims. 'Surprise visit' Foreign ministry sources said this is for the first time an Indian foreign secretary has come to Bangladesh without prior announcement and in such short notice. Menon disagrees. ""We meet regularly. We don't have a set schedule. We meet whenever we feel,"" he told reporters. Touhid said his Indian counterpart did not visit after the election of new government in Bangladesh. ""They think that they should prepare the ground for resolving outstanding bilateral issues after the election of the new government in India,"" said Touhid. ""We feel that many of the issues that we might have had difficulties in the past are now coming right to a situation where we can move forward,"" said Menon. He said he was ""very satisfied"" with the quality of the discussion which reflects ""the quality of the friendship"". Security Menon said he also discussed security issues. ""Security was one of issues we discussed, we discussed it in all the conversations and how important it is for both Bangladesh and India. ""And this is something that is in our common interest that we eliminate terrorism from our region and that we do this together. So, we will continue to work together to that direction"". The Indian foreign secretary met prime minister Sheikh Hasina and army chief Moeen U Ahmed Sunday night. He is expected to leave Dhaka Monday."

Up to 20,000 protesters rallied in the capital as opposition leaders tried to maintain momentum in their bid to oust Saakashvili over his record on democracy and last year's disastrous war with Russia. The European Union said the opposition should settle for dialogue and that the government should address the protesters' grievances to avoid the ""debilitating"" crisis repeating itself. Several thousand marched on the imposing presidential residence overlooking the Mtkvari River and dozens set up tents to spend the night. ""That way he will hear our voices much more loudly,"" said Kakha Kukava, one of the opposition leaders. Another, former United Nations ambassador Irakly Alasania, said the opposition was ready to hold talks with the president but that an election was the only way out of the deadlock. ""We are ready to discuss with the president the grounds for these demands and also hear from him how he sees the political crisis (being) resolved,"" said Alasania. ""He created a one-man state, and our political objective is to change this system."" Russia's crushing of a Georgian assault on breakaway South Ossetia last year has emboldened opponents who say he has made too many mistakes to stay in power until 2013. The West, which receives Caspian Sea oil via Georgia, is watching closely. DISCONTENT Some 60,000 people rallied on Thursday. Turnout dipped over the weekend and on Monday protest organizers said they were shifting the focus from the parliament to Saakahvili's office. Protesters continued to block Tbilisi's central avenue. Analysts question whether the opposition can remain united or muster sufficient numbers over a sustained period. Despite the defection of some key allies and repeated cabinet reshuffles since the war, Saakashvili's position appears to remain strong. Critics accuse him of monopolizing power and exerting pressure on the judiciary and media since coming to power on the back of the 2003 ""Rose Revolution."" Police dispersed the last peaceful mass protests against Saakashvili in a crackdown condemned by his Western backers. ""It can go on for a long time, but in our view a far better scenario is to identify the agenda for a political process,"" EU South Caucasus envoy Peter Semneby told Reuters.

Flower, part of the England coaching set up for two years, was in temporary charge of the team in the recent tour of the West Indies after Peter Moores was sacked in January. ""Andy Flower has accepted the role of team director with immediate effect,"" ECB managing director Hugh Morris told reporters at news conference at Lord's. ""As a player Andy became ranked the number one batsman in the world and the ECB believe he has the vision, drive and ambition to be just as successful in his new post."" Flower, 40, said lots of big decisions and hard work were needed at the start of a summer that culminates with a home Ashes series against Australia. ""At the start of the West Indies tour I didn't know whether I wanted to apply for this job or not but halfway through I made my mind up that I did,"" said Flower, who wore a black armband during a 2003 World Cup match in protest at the policies of Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe. ""I'm ambitious for England cricket and very honoured to be given this position. I believe that the last three months will stand me in good stead."" Morris said there had originally been 30 applicants for the position but declined to say how many of those were interviewed for what is one of the top jobs in world cricket. ""We had a great deal of interest and were happy with the level of candidates but we believe we have the right man for the job. Andy was a world class cricketer and we believe he can become a world class coach."" Flower will have precious little time to bed in before the serious business begins. He must choose a captain for the Twenty20 World Cup, select the squad for the West Indies series and prepare England for the visit of Australia. ""It's not going to be an easy year but it will be a very exciting one,"" he said. ""We have a little time to try and get some momentum going for the Ashes."" England's test series defeat in the Carribean means they are languishing in sixth place in the ICC's test rankings"

The assistance would consist of yen loans and grant aid, and is aimed at helping poverty-stricken areas that could become breeding grounds for extremists, as well as finance infrastructure, education and job training, the Nikkei said. Japan will announce the details on April 17 at a Pakistan donors' conference in Tokyo that it is co-hosting with the World Bank, the paper said. Pakistan has said it is seeking between $4 billion to $6 billion in aid pledges at the donors' conference to fill a financing gap over the next two years. The international community fears an economic meltdown in the nuclear-armed country could fan popular support for al Qaeda and other militant groups. Participants at the conference are expected to agree to provide about $4 billion in aid to Pakistan over two years, the Nikkei said. Japan had planned to chip in about 10 percent of that amount but will raise its contribution after the United States pledged annual aid of $1.5 billion, the paper said. Pakistan has drawn up a list of projects worth $30 billion it would like to see implemented over the next 10 years. The list includes hydro-electric dams and roads projects aimed at improving security in its violence-plagued northwest on the Afghan border. In November, Pakistan got an emergency $7.6 billion International Monetary Fund loan to stave off a balance of payments crisis."
en.15.119.188.2009.4.14,Overfishing to wipe out bluefin tuna in 3 years: WWF,"MADRID, Tue Apr 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Overfishing will wipe out the breeding population of Atlantic bluefin tuna, one of the ocean's largest and fastest predators, in three years unless catches are dramatically reduced, conservation group WWF said on Tuesday. As European fishing fleets prepare to begin the two-month Mediterranean fishing season on Wednesday, WWF said its analysis showed the bluefin tuna that spawn -- those aged four years and older -- will have disappeared by 2012 at current rates. ""For years people have been asking when the collapse of this fishery will happen, and now we have the answer,"" said Sergi Tudela, Head of Fisheries at WWF Mediterranean. The fish, which can weigh over half a ton and accelerate faster than a sports car, are a favorite of sushi lovers. Demand from Japan has triggered an explosion in the size of the Mediterranean fleet over the past decade and many of those boats use illegal spotter planes to track the warm-blooded tuna. ""Mediterranean (Atlantic) bluefin tuna is collapsing as we speak and yet the fishery will kick off again tomorrow for business as usual. It is absurd and inexcusable to open a fishing season when stocks of the target species are collapsing,"" added Tudela. Environmental groups condemned an agreement signed in November by states setting bluefin quotas -- a body dominated by EU members. The groups called it ""a disaster"" and ""a disgrace,"" saying the states again chose to ignore their own scientists and set quotas 47 percent higher than recommended. Illegal fishing is also rife for the bluefin, the dried, dark red meat of which once fed Roman armies on the march. Growing numbers of restaurants and retailers including Carrefour's Italian supermarkets are boycotting it. WWF said that analysis of official data showed the average size of mature tunas had more than halved since the 1990s and that this has had a disproportionately high impact since bigger fish produced many more offspring. The bluefin can only be saved by a complete halt to fishing in May and June as the fish rush through the Straits of Gibraltar to spawn in the Mediterranean, WWF and other campaign groups"

en.15.119.371.2009.4.12,"Arab foes of US warm to Obama, old allies wary","BEIRUT, Sun Apr 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barack Obama's open-handed approach to the Middle East has won him praise from some Arab leaders viewed by previous US presidents as deadly enemies. ""Obama is a flicker of hope amid the imperialist darkness,"" Muammar Gaddafi told a rally of his supporters last week. The Libyan leader, once a thorn in America's side, was dubbed a ""mad dog"" by former President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. He has mended ties with Washington since 2003. ""He (Obama) speaks logically. Arrogance no longer exists in the American approach which was previously based on dictating to the rest of the world to meet its own conditions,"" Gaddafi said. Obama has also earned conditional tributes from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Palestinian Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal and Lebanon's Grand Ayatollah Sayyed Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah -- all at times linked by Washington with terrorism. Even non-Arab Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has recognized that Obama might offer something new. ""We speak with great respect for Obama. But we are realists. We want to see real change,"" he told Germany's Der Spiegel magazine. ""We feel that Obama must now follow his words with actions."" The readiness of America's adversaries to acknowledge that Obama has brought a more sensitive verbal approach to the region is striking. In contrast, some traditional US allies such as Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak have kept tight-lipped. Conservative Arab leaders may have misgivings about Obama's overtures to their own regional rivals, Iran and Syria, and may fear that he will in time renew US pressure for human rights and democratic reform in their own autocratic systems. But for many in the Middle East, Obama's search for dialogue with Iran, his declaration in Turkey this month that America was not at war with Islam, his stress on a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and his plans to withdraw from Iraq constitute a reassuring change from the perceived belligerence and pro-Israeli bias of his predecessor George W. Bush. Now Arab leaders wonder whether Obama is able or willing to change the substance, not just the tone, of U.S. policy. If so, some at least seem eager to do business with him. ""It is most natural to want a meeting with President Obama,"" Assad told The New Yorker's Seymour Hersh by email. Assad, whose officials conducted Turkish-mediated peace talks with Israel last year, has long called for the United States to play a more active role in Middle East peace-making. TEMPERED OPTIMISM Despite such hopes, Syria remains cautious. ""We see what Obama said as positive,"" Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in an interview with Lebanon's As-Safir newspaper last week. ""But now we need to see how the United States will deal with the extreme right-wing Israeli government"" led by new Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu has not endorsed a two-state solution. His foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, has openly rejected it, dismissing ..-backed peace talks with the Palestinians as a ""dead end."" Those talks have excluded Hamas, shunned by the United States, the European Union and the United Nations for its refusal to recognize Israel or renounce violence. But Meshaal says the great powers will realize they need the Islamist group, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since routing its Fatah rivals in 2007, to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. ""Regarding an official opening toward Hamas, it's just a matter of time,"" he told Italy's La Repubblica daily last month. Meshaal, based in Damascus, hailed Obama's ""new language,"" adding: ""The challenge for everybody is for this to be the prelude for a genuine change in US and European policies."" The United States and its allies have feuded for years with Iran, Syria and the radical Islamist groups they assist such as Hamas and the Lebanese Shi'ite Hezbollah movement. Fadlallah, a Shi'ite cleric who was close to Hezbollah in the 1980s, when kidnappers snatched many foreigners and suicide bombers struck US troops and diplomats in Lebanon, praised Obama's ""human values"" and his sincerity toward Islam. ""But the question that presents itself is whether President Obama can realize any of these slogans when faced by the institutions that govern America and over which the president does not have complete control,"" he told Reuters last week. Fadlallah welcomed Obama's quest to repair relations with Iran, predicting that concerns of conservative Arab states about Iranian influence would fade if US-Iranian ties improved. Saudi Arabia and Egypt have both warned in recent months of Iran's growing regional power, while simultaneously exploring accommodation with Tehran, rather than direct confrontation. Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal last week welcomed Washington's ""positive approach"" of seeking a diplomatic way out of the Iranian nuclear crisis and urged Iran to reciprocate. But Obama's outreach to Tehran appears to have discomfited Egypt, a longstanding US ally, an Egyptian analyst said. ""It makes some Arab governments, particularly Egypt, quite unhappy because they would have liked to be on the same side with the Americans in dealing with Iran,"" said Mustapha al-Sayyid, political science professor at Cairo Univer"
en.15.119.334.2009.4.15,'Fake' Indian fry worry shrimp farmers,"Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)  Farmers say the export-focused shrimp industry is under threat from substandard or 'fake' Indian Golda fry smuggled into Bangladesh. They say the fake fry will hit their exports hard, and the government will lose revenue to a production slump. Bangladesh is famous for two varieties of giant prawn, the freshwater Golda and the saltwater Bagda or Tiger prawn, which constitute nearly 90 percent of frozen food exports, the second biggest foreign exchange earner after apparel. Nearly 30 percent of prawn exports are Golda and the rest Bagda, according to exporters. ""Huge amounts of young prawns are entering Bangladesh through the Satkhira border,"" Sheikh Mohammad Shafiuddin, convenor of Golda Hatchery Association of Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com Sunday. The illegal traders sell them as 'Golda fry caught in local rivers'. ""The fry are not caught locally, but smuggled from India. And they are not even Golda fry,"" said Shafiuddin. The government has banned fishing of fry in rivers. The farmers who have spent crores of taka on hatcheries are losing out because the smuggled fry are sold much cheaper than local varieties, according to him. The government-approved hatcheries produce around 120 crore of the giant freshwater prawns a year against a demand of 120-150 crore, Shafiuddin said. ""The fry that are being smuggled in do not grow big, 30-40 of the Indian variety make one kg, but four of our Golda prawns, when adult, make one kg,"" Mostafa Shiblee, managing director of Shiblee Hatchery and Firm, Kuakata, in Patuakhali told bdnews24.com. ""Theirs are grown in hatcheries in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa in India and after 10-12 days they are sent to Bangladesh. (But) real Golda fry have to be kept in hatcheries for 40-45 days."" Dr Mahmudul Karim, executive director of Bangladesh Shrimp and Fish Foundation, told bdnews24.com he had been hearing for quite some time that fry were being smuggled in. Farmers will be affected if there are sold anything other than Golda fry. He asked if substandard fry were, in fact, coming in what the fisheries officials were doing. Golda prawns had good prospects but the government needed to support the industry, he said. He added that the hatcheries were simply not capable to meet the demand for Golda prawns at present. Director general of Fisheries Department Rafiqul Islam said he did not know for sure if the fry was being smuggled in. But, he added, if it was true then the onus lay with the border guards to prevent it. ""We are thinking about writing to the BDR about the issue."" Fisheries minister Abdul Latif Biswas also told bdnews24.com Monday that they had heard about the smuggling of fry, sat with the farmers and run investigations but had no specific information. ""Still, we will try to gather more information and take steps against those involved with the smuggling of fake fry."" He said a national policy on the shrimp sector would be formulated soon to control quality. ""We will take measures to breed the best prawns."" The first eight months of the ongoing 2009-10 fiscal year saw export of frozen foods drop by around 10 percent against the past year . Bangladesh exported frozen foods worth $371 million from Feb-July last year to the United States, EU countries and Japan but this year it exported $331 million. bdnew"

On a national day of mourning about 200 coffins will be laid out on the parade ground of a police academy in the mountain city of L'Aquila for the funeral at 11 a.m. (5 a.m. EDT). About 1,600 bereaved relatives are expected to attend. ""I'll be there,"" said 30-year-old Angelo Dania, whose house was destroyed by the 6.3 magnitude quake that hit the central Italian region of Abruzzo early on Monday as residents slept. ""I am worried about my house but, in the end, I am the lucky one,"" he said. ""I could have been one of them."" Rescue efforts were drawing to an end as hopes of pulling any more survivors from the rubble faded. ""The search is almost over,"" said Luca Spoletini, spokesman of the Civil Protection agency which is coordinating Italy's response to the emergency. But one fireman said: ""As long as we know there are people under the rubble we'll keep searching even if we're sure they're dead. Families need to know what happened to their loved ones."" Rescue work continued to be hampered by violent aftershocks on Thursday, which further damaged buildings in the medieval towns and terrified the 17,000 people living in tent villages. Thousands more survivors are being put up in hotels or relatives' homes. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called L'Aquila a ""ghost town"" and said reconstruction would cost billions. He plans to attend the state funeral, where Catholic mass will be led by the Vatican's second highest priest, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone. The funeral required a special dispensation because mass is not usually celebrated on Good Friday in the Catholic church. Pope Benedict has said he will visit Abruzzo soon. There will also be an Islamic rite funeral for six Muslim victims. REBUILDING STARTS After the funeral, survivors will start thinking about how to pick up their lives in a region that relies on tourism, farming and family firms. Italy's industry minister said more than half of the companies in Abruzzo ""are no longer producing."" One estimate put the damage at up to 3 billion euros ($4 billion), though its impact on Italy's nearly 2-trillion-euro economy, already mired in recession, is expected to be limited. The government plans to suspend some tax, utility and phone bills in the affected areas and has earmarked 100 million euros for rescue, relief and reconstruction efforts. Italian banks may also suspend mortgage payments and bank charges for survivors. Local builders, rejecting suggestions that shoddy building was to blame for the collapse of modern buildings that should have been earthquake-proof, including a hospital and student hostel, said some of the damage would prove to be superficial. ""We are not killers,"" said builder Filiberto Cicchetti. ""In two weeks it will be seen that 90 percent of private housing built outside the city walls from the '60s on is still viable."" ""The medieval city built 450 years ago has been destroyed but the city will be reborn and rebuilt according to the rules of the trade,"" he promised. Locals were mystified as to why some houses were flattened while neighboring ones of the same period survived, or why the village of Onna was almost entirely destroyed, and its tiny population decimated, but Monticchio next door was untouched. ""It's as if the earthquake tried to avoid us,"" 45-year-old Amedeo Nardicchio said in Monticchio. ""We were lu"

""We have spoken with the ECB, and we will speak again with Giles Clarke when we all get together for the next ICC meeting in Dubai. There are other alternatives too. Kuala Lumpur, Ireland and Glasgow are among those. Nothing has been finalised at this stage but we will hope to make a decision in the next month."" Pakistan will return to competitive cricket this month when they play Australia in a five-match one-day series, followed by a one-off Twenty20 match, in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. They have not played since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore on March 3, and now face an uncertain future with teams unwilling to tour in the immediate future due to the security risk. England and the UAE have previously been discussed as potential foreign bases for the Pakistan team, but Malaysia, Ireland and Scotland emerged as new contenders. In 2006, Kuala Lumpur's Kinrara Academy Oval hosted a triangular one-day series featuring India, Australia and West Indies. Ireland and Scotland, meanwhile, host international cricket on a more regular basis, as their respective national teams attempt to ascend from the Associate ranks.

""Our aim is to heighten interest in cricket in Ireland,"" Deutrom said. ""We are trying to build an argument that we are a sufficiently viable cricket nation to make the step up to the elite level.

Agreement on shelf limits gives states the right to exploit resources on and beneath the seabed, such as oil and gas or the genes of marine organisms, officials said. A US official report last year said the Arctic contains enough oil and gas to meet current world demand for three years, or 90 billion barrels. And global warming may make the region more accessible. Norway accepted adjustments by Commission experts to a submission Oslo made in 2006 and would write the new limits into national law, Stoere said. Other states ringing the Arctic Ocean are the United States, Russia, Canada and Denmark via Greenland. Stoere said boundaries were set between Norway and Greenland, Iceland and the Faroes. ""In the discussion about who owns the North Pole -- it's definitely not us,"" he said. RUSSIAN FLAG Russia planted a flag on the seabed 4,261 meters (13,980 ft) beneath the Pole in 2007 in a symbolic claim. Denmark has also said that the Pole is Danish, because of a subsea ridge running north from Greenland toward Russia. Stoere said the Norwegian shelf still has some undefined areas because of long-running disputes with Russia to the east and over how to define the area around the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard -- open to all signatories of a 1920 treaty. Under the Law of the Sea, coastal states own the seabed beyond existing 200 nautical mile zones if it is part of a continental shelf of shallower waters. Some shelves stretch hundreds of kms before reaching the deep ocean floor, which is owned by no state. Stoere said that Norway was not gaining territory, merely defining what was its under international law. The Commission has set a deadline of May 13 this year for most coastal states to submit limits on their shelves. Countries such as the United States, which have not ratified the Law of the Sea, are exempt. Elsewhwere in the world, a few nations including Australia and New Zealand have completed similar negotiations as Norway"

Police in the region's main city, Guwahati, also recovered two powerful bombs from a militant hideout, senior police officer Manabendra Deb Rai said, less than a week after four blasts in notheastern Assam state killed 10 people. ""With the recovery of these bombs, a major disaster has been averted,"" Rai said. Heavily armed militants of the little known Dima Haolam Daoga (DHD), also called the ""Black Widow"", attacked a local train, killing two special police officers in the North Cachar Hills district of Assam, about 350 km (220 miles) from Guwahati. The same group also attacked a goods train in the same area, injuring a security guard, railway authorities said. Train services have been suspended indefinitely. Another group of around 10 heavily armed militants of the Karbi Longri National Liberation Front (KLNLF) attacked a military patrol early on Saturday in the adjoining district of Karbi Anglong, police said. A militant and a villager were killed in a gunbattle. Both districts go to the polls in the first phase of India's April-May general election starting next week. More than two dozen armed groups in India's northeast are fighting either for an independent homeland or more political autonomy, and accuse New Delhi of plundering the region's mineral and forest resources, and neglecting the local economy."

Marie Heuze told a news briefing that Ahmadinejad, who has in the past questioned whether the Holocaust took place, was one of four heads of state who had confirmed they would attend. Ahmadinejad is due to give a news conference on April 23 at the UN's European headquarters where the conference is being held from April 22-26. Also present will be Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, secretary- general of the 56-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), which has sought to have Israeli policy toward Palestinians denounced in the UN as racist. The OIC also initially tried to have ""defamation of religion"" included as racist behavior in a final conference declaration, an issue which Western countries say is a bid to limit free speech. Israel and Canada have said they will not attend the conference which has been called to review the outcome of a UN meeting on racism in Durban in 2001. The United States and Israel walked out of the Durban meeting before it ended, but European and other countries stayed to the end and ensured its final declaration dropped criticism of Israel that Islamic states had sought to include. The new U.S. Democratic administration of Barack Obama has yet to make up its mind whether to attend next week's meeting, dubbed Durban II. Other Western countries are also awaiting the outcome of negotiations in Geneva on the text of the final document. Many argued earlier versions of the final text were totally unacceptable to liberal democracies. Diplomats say many of the problem phrases -- including ""defamation of religion"" and any mention of Israel -- have now been removed. But they say the OIC and its allies could try during the meeting to have them restored. Apart from Iran, the other three countries sending their heads of state to Durban II are East Timor, Togo and Montenegro. Among countries which have said they will be sending their foreign ministers are Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda and Norway. The 27-nation European Union has yet to decide on a common position on whether to at"
en.15.119.363.2009.4.15,Botha reported for suspect action,"Port Elizabeth, April 15 (bdnews24.com)- South African offspinner Johan Botha has been reported for a suspected illegal bowling action by match officials after the fourth ODI against Australia in Port Elizabeth, cricinfo reports. Botha will undergo a bio-mechanical assessment of his action, but is eligible to play international cricket at the discretion of Cricket South Africa (CSA) while the test results are pending. The report was filed by the three umpires officiating Monday's one-dayer - South Africans Brian Jerling and Rudi Koertzen, and Sri Lanka's Asoka de Silva - who cited concerns over Botha's quicker ball and doosra. Botha will be tested within 21 days after CSA receives a formal notice from the ICC. Gerald Majola, the CSA chief executive, said the development was disappointing for the team but hoped Botha would complete the ICC process in time for the World Twenty20 in June. ""It's very disappointing for the team, especially considering his performance over the recent past,"" Majola told Cricinfo. ""But there's nothing we can do. We will follow the procedure laid down by the ICC. Hopefully, he will be cleared before the World Twenty20."" The appointed specialist will report to the ICC with the result of the bio-mechanical assessment within 14 days of the test. If the action is found to be illegal, Botha will be suspended from bowling in international cricket with immediate effect. He would have the option of applying to the ICC for a re-assessment of his action at any time. Botha's action was previously reported after his Test debut against Australia at the SCG in January, 2006. He was suspended from bowling the following month when testing confirmed the illegality of his action. In September 2006, Botha's action was once again found to be illegal even after he had worked on it. He then corrected his action, which was deemed legal upon re-testing, and he resumed playing international cricket in the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup. ""I have put a lot of work into my action,"" Botha said during the recent one-day series in Australia. ""It probably took 10 months from my first test to the one I passed. I still have (the doosra), but I probably don't bowl it as much as I used to. Definitely, it is possible to bowl it legally. ""My doosra actually tested lower than my off spinner for elbow extension. I think my doosra was at 9 per cent, and my offie was at 11 per cent, which are both well below the limit. With the doosra, your wrist cocks to a point where it is actually harder to extend your elbow. I just use it better than I did in the past."" Cric"
en.15.119.115.2009.4.12,UN draft demands enforcement of N.Korea sanctions,"UNITED NATIONS, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Six world powers agreed to a draft U.N. Security Council statement on Saturday that condemns North Korea's rocket launch and calls for enforcement of UN sanctions imposed against Pyongyang. The 15-nation council met briefly to receive copies of the US-drafted statement, agreement on which was hammered out in a two-hour meeting between the ambassadors of the United States, Japan, China, Britain, France and Russia. With the five permanent council members and Japan backing the statement, diplomats said its formal adoption by the full council at a further meeting called for Monday afternoon was virtually assured. ""The Security Council condemns the 5 April 2009 launch by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), which is in contravention of Security Council resolution 1718,"" the statement said. The draft also calls for the UN Sanctions Committee to begin enforcing financial sanctions and an arms embargo laid down in an existing council resolution. That resolution, number 1718, was passed after a nuclear test by Pyongyang in October 2006. It forbids North Korea from launching ballistic missiles or carrying out further nuclear tests. It also bans the import or export of arms and related goods by Pyongyang. Saturday's deal on a so-called presidential statement ended a week-long deadlock on a council response to the North Korean launch, which had pitched Japan and China against each other. U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said the draft statement is ""very strong and sends a clear message to the DPRK that their violation of international law will not be treated with impunity and indeed will have consequences."" CHINA OPPOSED RESOLUTION China's envoy Zhang Yesui, who had opposed US and Japanese calls for new sanctions against Pyongyang, was quoted by China's Xinhua news agency as saying that the six powers had reached a consensus on a draft that was ""cautious and proportionate,"" as Beijing had wanted from the beginning. The United States, Japan and South Korea have repeatedly said that North Korea launched a long-range ballistic missile, not a satellite, in violation of resolution 1718. Japan had been pushing for a council resolution that would declare Pyongyang in violation of resolution 1718. But China and Russia, which have vetoes on the council, opposed this. They were not convinced the rocket launch, which North Korea says put a satellite into orbit, was a violation. China was also opposed to a council resolution, insisting instead that the council adopt a presidential statement, which is a formal statement of the council's position by its president. It is generally seen as weaker than a resolution. Rice said that the statement would be legally binding, a position that was supported by British Ambassador John Sawers. Japanese Ambassador Yukio Takasu told reporters that ""Japan's strong preference was a resolution"" but said Tokyo had decided to back the statement in the interest of unanimity. ""Equally important is unity and ... unity of the council should be lost if we insist until the end,"" he said. ""That's why we have accepted this very strong presidential statement."" SANCTIONS NOT ENFORCED The sanctions committee on North Korea has not met for two years and has not designated a single North Korean company to be added to the U.N. blacklist of banned entities, diplomats say. As a result, the sanctions were not enforced, they say. The draft calls for the committee to ""undertake its tasks to this effect"" and designate ""entities and goods"" to face sanctions. It adds that if the committee failed to do so by the end of the month, the council would draw up its own list. Although the statement does not explicitly declare Pyongyang in violation of 1718, diplomats said the language in the draft that it contravened the resolution, a compromise that was acceptable to Beijing, has the same legal meaning. The draft also calls for Pyongyang to return to stalled six-party talks aimed at ending its nuclear program and demands that it refrain from any further launches. The talks group North and South Korea, China, Russia, Japan and the United States"

The attack was the deadliest for U.S. soldiers in Iraq for months. An insurgency led by al Qaeda and other militants has proven stubborn in Mosul, 390 km (240 miles) north of Baghdad, even as the violence set off by the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 has waned elsewhere in Iraq. Two U.S. soldiers and 20 members of the Iraqi security forces were wounded in the blast, the U.S. military said. Iraqi police said the blast wounded 70 people and destroyed five Iraqi and two U.S. armoured vehicles. The number of U.S. soldiers killed in action in March was the lowest since the invasion. But in February four U.S. soldiers were killed in a single attack. At least 4,200 U.S. troops and tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed since the invasion. Insurgent groups have exploited the divisions among Mosul's patchwork of Kurds, Sunni Arabs, Christians and other groups to remain effective, and are also known to retreat to hideouts in the remote and mountainous region surrounding the city."
en.15.119.347.2009.4.14,EU starts action against Britain over data privacy,"BRUSSELS, Tue Apr 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission started legal action against Britain on Tuesday for what the EU executive called a failure to keep people's online details confidential. EU Telecoms Commissioner Viviane Reding said the action related to how Internet service providers used Phorm technology to send subscribers tailor-made advertisements based on websites visited. Britain has two months to respond to the charges, a Commission spokesman said. BT admitted in April last year that it had tested Phorm in 2006 and 2007 without telling its customers, the Commission said. The trials sparked ""snooping"" accusations from privacy groups and concern from the founder of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, but found support from UK telecoms regulator Ofcom. Phorm told Reuters earlier this month it was delighted with the trials it had held in Britain and that it was in talks on further international expansion through joint ventures and did not fear regulatory intervention. Reding said Internet users in Britain had complained about the way the UK applied EU rules on privacy and electronic communications that were meant to prohibit interception and surveillance without the user's consent. ""Technologies like Internet behavioral advertising can be useful for businesses and consumers but they must be used in a way that complies with EU rules,"" Reding said in a statement. ""We have been following the Phorm case for some time and have concluded that there are problems in the way the UK has implemented parts of the EU rules on the confidentiality of communications,"" Reding said. BT carried out new, invitation-based trials of Phorm in the final quarter of 2008 that resulted in a number of complaints, the Commission said. Phorm has said it is in talks with two other British Internet service providers, Virgin Media and Carphone Warehouse, and has launched a South Korean trial. The European Union executive said it was concerned that under UK rules, interception was lawful when the service provider had reasonable grounds to believe consent had been given. ""The Commission is also concerned that the UK does not have an independent national supervisory authority dealing with such interceptions,"" the Commission said. Reding called on Britain to change its national laws to ensure there were proper sanctions to enforce EU confidentiality rules. Unless Britain complies, Reding has the power to issue a final warning before taking the country to the 27-nation EU's top court, the European Court of Justice. If it rules in favor of the European Commission, the court can force Britain to change its"

But the new Yankee Stadium is adding tofu, calamari, edamame and taralli to the menu. A distinctly international flavor representing New York's ethnic melting pot runs through the 100-odd culinary items that will be for sale on Thursday when the New York Yankees play their first regular season game at their new home. The $1.5 billion stadium has won praise for retaining the original look of the historic 86-year-old ballpark it replaces, including the old Yankee Stadium's famous facade. But gone are the days when baseball fare was limited to hot dogs, along with the peanuts and Cracker Jack caramel-coated popcorn snack celebrated in the song ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game."" Baseball fans were surveyed to determine the menus, said Mike Phillips, senior vice president of Legends Hospitality Management, the company overseeing stadium fare. Speaking on Wednesday at a media preview of the food concessions, Phillips said the gastronomic array reflected the city's diverse ethnic tastes and should please many foreign spectators, such as the Japanese fans who cheer for Yankees' player Hideki Matsui. ""We have the sushi, we have the Asian noodle concept, we have the Cuban sandwich,"" said Phillips. ""I think we have everything covered."" ""It was all about satisfying the fans,"" he said. ""We asked them what they wanted."" Apparently they wanted sashimi, shrimp tempura, antipasto and pan-fried noodles, along with the Italian snack food taralli and Asian soybean dish edamame. For dessert, fans can sample the Italian pastry zeppole. Also available is popular American fare like cheeseburgers, barbecue and steak sandwiches. But fear not for the old-fashioned hot dog. More than 60 percent of spectators buy hot dogs, officials said. ""If you offer variety, people won't stop eating hot dogs. They'll eat a hot dog and something else,"" said Marty Greenspun, Legends president. A typical baseball season will see enough hot dogs sold to stretch some 300 miles, Legends officials said. Not all nationalities are represented. Missing, for example, is any whiff of French food. ""We're working on that,"" said one Legends official. ""We have French fries,"" another offered"

""A notice will be sent to Khaleda Zia, in line with the Cantonment Act 1924, Section 11, to leave the house,"" Shafiq Ahmed told reporters after a meeting with the attorney general, the cabinet secretary and the defence secretary. ""She will be requested to vacate and given a deadline,"" the minister said. ""If she did not, then law will take its course."" The minister dismissed statement by BNP's Moudud Ahmed that the property had been leased for ever to the widow of Gen Ziaur Rahman, murdered by some military officers on May 30, 1981. ""If the (process of) allocation was illegal, then there is no question of (giving) a permanent lease,"" the law minister said. He said the June 12, 1981 cabinet meeting decided to gift her a 1.5-bigha property in Gulshan. ""And she refused to take the cantonment property. It's been written in the minutes of that meeting."" On the political protests surrounding the government decision, the minister said, ""The house was given to Khaleda Zia. Not to any political party or head of any political party. ""So it'd be useless trying to create a political issue out of it."" The law minister said it was unethical on part of the former prime minister to enjoy the ownership of two very expensive houses originally owned by the state. According to one estimate, the 9-bigha mansion at 6 Moinul Road would cost Tk 350 crore at current prices, while 1.5-bigha Gulshan house Tk 50 crore."

Survivors told the UN High Commissioner for Refugees that the boat, carrying 72 Somalis and Ethiopians, was far from the Yemeni coast when smugglers started to force them off, the agency said in a statement dated Saturday. ""I owe my life to my brother who helped me swim ashore,"" one of the 58 survivors told UNHCR staff at a transit camp. Last year 50,000 people, mostly from Somalia and Ethiopia, took rickety smugglers' ships across the Gulf of Aden, which is on the sea route from Europe to the Middle East and Asia via the Suez Canal. Most are thought to be seeking jobs in the Middle East, or fleeing political turmoil in Somalia or drought and food shortages in Ethiopia. UNHCR said 350 boats and 17,936 people have arrived in Yemen this year after crossing the Gulf of Aden from the Horn of Africa. To date, 116 people have been reported dead and 66 are missing at sea.

Surging militant violence across Pakistan and the spread of Taliban influence through the northwest are reviving concerns about the stability of the nuclear-armed U.S. ally. Pakistan is crucial to U.S. efforts to stabilize neighboring Afghanistan but the government has been unable to check militant attacks in its cities let alone stop insurgents crossing into Afghanistan from border strongholds to battle Western forces. Clashes erupted in Buner district last week after scores of Taliban moved in unopposed from the neighboring Swat valley, where authorities struck a deal with Islamists in February to enforce Islamic law in a bid to end violence. Buner residents formed a militia, or ""lashkar,"" to resist the militants and 13 people, including eight Taliban, three policemen and two villagers, were killed in clashes. Authorities say they are negotiating with the militants to persuade them to withdraw but the Taliban have stayed put and appeared determined to take over the valley, police said. ""They are everywhere,"" Arsala Khan, a deputy superintendent of police, told Reuters by telephone from Buner. ""They are visiting mosques, they are visiting bazaars asking people to help them in enforcing sharia,"" he said. ""Buner is fast turning into Swat."" Swat, to the west of Buner, was one of Pakistan's main tourist destinations until 2007 when militants infiltrated into the North West Frontier Province valley from strongholds on the Afghan border to support a radical cleric.

Abbas extended holiday greetings for the Jewish Passover festival, adding that ""both sides needed to work for peace,"" a statement from the Israeli prime minister's office said. Netanyahu, whose right-leaning government took office on March 31, said ""he intended to resume"" talks and cooperation with the Palestinians for the sake of promoting peace, the statement said. Israeli officials said it was the first contact between the two leaders since Netanyahu became prime minister for the second time. He last held the post from 1996 to 1999. Netanyahu ""recalled their past cooperation and conversations, and how he intended to resume this in the future in order to advance peace,"" said the statement. Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said on Friday Abbas had made peace talks with Netanyahu's cabinet conditional on it committing to US-brokered understandings reached at a 2007 Annapolis summit, and freezing Jewish settlement growth. Erekat's remarks followed comments last week by far-right Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman that the statehood talks launched at Annapolis were no longer valid. Netanyahu himself has been more vague, saying his priority was to focus on economic and security issues instead of negotiating core issues such as statehood borders and the fate of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.

en.15.119.112.2009.4.14,Saudi Arabia to regulate girls' marriages,"RIYADH, Tue Apr 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to regulate the marriages of young girls, its justice minister was quoted as saying on Tuesday, after a court refused to nullify the marriage of an 8-year-old to a man 50 years her senior. The justice ministry aims ""to put an end to arbitrariness by parents and guardians in marrying off minor girls,"" Justice Minister Mohamed al-Issa told al-Watan newspaper, partially owned by members of the royal family. Saudi Arabia is a patriarchal society that applies an austere form of Sunni Islam that bans unrelated men and women from mixing and gives fathers the right to wed their sons and daughters to whoever they deem fit. The minister's comments suggested the practice of marrying off young girls would not be abolished. The regulations will seek to ""preserve the rights, fending off blights to end the negative aspects of underage girls' marriage,"" he said. A court in the Saudi town of Unaiza upheld for the second time last week the marriage of the Saudi girl to a man who is about 50 years her senior, on condition he does not have sex with her until she reaches puberty. The minister added that any new regulations would be made under the provision that the requirements of universal laws were not binding to religious commandments. Officials at the ministry could not be reached for comment. Financial considerations could prompt some Saudi families to wed their underage daughters to much older men. Many Saudi clerics, including the kingdom's chief cleric Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdelaziz Al al-Sheikh, endorse the practice. ""For them this is allowed by Islamic Sharia law,"" lawyer Abdul-Rahman al-Lahem said. ""Some (clerics) will be against this (plan) but the justice minister is also a cleric and a member of the kingdom's top clerics body."" Many young girls in Arab countries that observe tribal traditions are married to older husbands but not before puberty. Such marriages are also driven by poverty in countries like Yemen, one of the poorest countries outside Africa. The UN children's agency UNICEF expressed on Monday its ""deep concern"" over the Onaiza court ruling. ""Irrespective of circumstances or the legal framework, the marriage of a child is a violation of that child's rights,"" UNICEF's chief, Ann Veneman, said in a state"

PSG, now unbeaten in their last eight UEFA Cup games, dominated the match but proved too clumsy in front of goal to establish a lead for next week's return in Ukraine. Midfielder Clement Chantome had the best chance for the Ligue 1 side but his powerful shot was superbly saved by Dynamo goalkeeper Stanislav Bogush on the half hour. ""Our main objective tonight was to not concede a goal but it is a bit frustrating as we had some good chances,"" PSG coach Paul Le Guen told reporters. ""We are still hopeful we can go through to the next round but we will have to be more realistic in front of the goal,"" he added. Dynamo coach Yuri Semin said: ""We now have the advantage of playing the second leg at home."" The Ukrainian league leaders also had their chances, the clearest in the 50th minute when an Olexandr Aliyev effort from outside the box was tipped away by PSG keeper Mickael Landreau. Le Guen, who has been complaining all season that he has too few top players in his squad, started with captain Claude Makelele and forward Ludovic Giuly on the bench. Both were rested before a crucial Ligue 1 game at Lille on Sunday. Stephane Sessegnon, the driving force in PSG's midfield this season, set up fellow midfielder Chantome only for Bogush to deny the hosts with his foot after half an hour.

Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Danish premier until earlier this month, is due in August to become secretary general of NATO, which leads a 56,000-strong international force fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. The publication of the cartoons in a Danish newspaper in 2006 led to riots across the Muslim world, including bloody protests in Afghanistan in which several people were killed. Rasmussen had defended the publication of the cartoons on the grounds of free speech and refused to apologize to Muslim countries. In an article posted on the Taliban's website (http://alemarah1.org/english/), the insurgent group said Rasmussen's appointment would ""further strengthen the faith of the Muslims"" to fight against NATO and would lead to ""intensification of war"" in Afghanistan. ""The major enemy of Islam's Prophet...has become the secretary general of NATO,"" said the undated article. Turkey, NATO's only mainly Muslim member, dropped its veto to Rasmussen's appointment this month after U.S. President Barack Obama offered promises that one of Rasmussen's deputies would be a Turk and Turkish commanders would be present at NATO command. Turkey had said Rasmussen's appointment would exacerbate hostility toward the West in Muslim countries, including Afghanistan, where NATO's military operation is the biggest in its history.

""I've lost the happiness of playing,"" the 27-year-old told reporters. ""I wouldn't like to go back to Italy, I want to live in peace here in Brazil."" ""I don't know if I'm going to stay for one, two or thee months without playing. I'm going to rethink my career."" He denied he was suffering from depression, added that happiness was more important than money, and said he had been living with the pressures of being a professional footballer since he was a teenager. Adriano failed to return to Italy after last week's World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Peru, in which he was an unused substitute. On Monday, his agent Gilmar Rinaldi said Adriano had stayed in Brazil because of a private matter and confirmed the player had spent time in Vila Cruzeiro, a Rio de Janeiro favela notorious for violence, where he was raised. Since then, Brazilian media had been full of speculation over what had happened to him. ""There's no way I'm going to stop visiting my community,"" said Adriano. ""That's where I'm at ease, barefoot and in bermudas."" ""A lot of things have been said in the newspapers but everything I've done has been thought through. I'm not ill. Adriano's not dead,"" he said, smiling. The striker, who has 29 goals in 47 appearances for Brazil, made his mark at international level when he was top scorer at the 2004 Copa America and the following year's Confederations Cup after replacing the unavailable Ronaldo in both tournaments. FALSE DAWNS He also scored a hat-trick in World Cup qualifier against Chile in September 2005. The powerful forward has struggled with fitness and alcohol problems since the 2006 World Cup, showing only flashes of the form that made him one of the world's most feared predators. He spent six months on loan with Sao Paulo in the first half of last year but after returning to Inter he irritated coach Jose Mourinho with a perceived lack of commitment. But Adriano, who has had a number of false dawns, had been edging back into favour at the club in the last two months. ""I genuinely wasn't happy in doing what I've always enjoyed. I've lost the appetite, the glow. That's one of the things which made me do this. Money's not important, nothing is important in life apart from happiness. ""There's no other problem. I like to laugh, to joke around and that wasn't happening any more. I wasn't enjoying myself on the pitch. ""I've got nothing against Inter but I wasn't happy in Italy. There has been very great pressure on me since I was 18. I've taken this decision so I can be happy again. It's nothing to do with depression, I know what I'm doing."
en.15.119.54.2009.4.14,US may drop key condition for Iran nuclear talks: report,"WASHINGTON, Mon Apr 13,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Obama administration and its European allies are considering dropping a long-standing US demand that Iran immediately shut down its nuclear facilities if it enters talks over its atomic program, The New York Times reported on Monday on its website. The proposal would also allow Tehran to continue enriching uranium for some period during the talks and would be a sharp break from the Bush administration, which had demanded that Iran halt its enrichment activities, the report said. Enriching uranium can produce fuel for a nuclear power plant or, if purified to a much higher degree, provide material for an atomic bomb. The West suspects Iran's nuclear program is cover for building an atomic bomb but Tehran says it is to generate electricity. The proposals, still under discussion, were aimed at drawing Iran into nuclear talks that it has so far shunned, the newspaper said, citing officials involved in the strategy sessions. A senior Obama administration official cautioned that ""we are still at the brainstorming level"" and said the terms of an opening proposal to Iran were still being debated, the newspaper said. The six major powers dealing with Iran, including the United States, met in London last week and invited Tehran to a new round of talks about its nuclear program. The New York Times cited European officials as saying that in talks during Obama's visit to Europe there was agreement that Iran would not accept the immediate shutdown of its facilities that the Bush administration had demanded. Obama administration officials declined to discuss details of their deliberations, but said any new American policy would ultimately require Iran to cease enrichment, the newspaper said. ""Our goal remains exactly what it has been in the UN resolutions: suspension,"" one senior administration official told the newsp"

The Frenchman, seeking to extend Arsenal's 62-year unbeaten record in FA Cup ties against their London rivals on Saturday, said he would pick a team that would enjoy the day and play 'the Arsenal way'. ""Yes it is bad news again,"" Wenger told a news conference when asked about his squad's fitness. ""Bacary Sagna is out because he is ill. He has come to the training ground, but he has a virus, he is weak and cannot play. ""That means we are short in numbers, but not in quality so we will go there and try to play our best. We are not going to sit back and let Chelsea dictate to us."" Arsenal last lost to Chelsea in the FA Cup 2-0 in a third round second replay on Jan. 20, 1947. ""I am not one for the history like that,"" said Wenger. ""This match is about how we play, and how they play, on the day. We are just going there to go for it."" Arsenal will be without first-choice goalkeeper Manuel Almunia (ankle), central defenders Johan Djourou (knee) and William Gallas (knee), full backs Gael Clichy (back) and Sagna (virus) and possibly reserve left back Kieran Gibbs (groin) who was injured during Wednesday's 3-0 Champions League win over Villarreal. Gibbs is expected to have a fitness test on Saturday at Wembley. Wenger said his team's greatest challenge would be to contain the threat from Chelsea's in-form Ivorian striker Didier Drogba. ""Didier Drogba is a fighter and we must make sure we contain him. It is one of the keys for us to keep him quiet,"" Wenger said. Drogba has scored seven goals in his eight games against Arsenal. Wenger paid tribute to the achievements of Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink, who has revitalised the side since taking over on a temporary basis in February following the sacking of Brazilian Luiz Felipe Scolari. ""Anyone who has been at the very top level and survived for so long is high quality,"" he said. ""He is very experienced and he has given them belief and strength. They are going to be difficult to beat."" Surprisingly, Wenger said he was not a fan of the new Wembley stadium. ""I have only been there onceto see the FA Cup final in 2007 between Chelsea and Manchester Unitedand I was not too impressed. I loved the old Wembley personally. ""When I was a boy, everyone played on some bad pitches but dreamt of going to play on the perfect grass on the pitch at Wembley. It was part of the history and it was something special. But not now."

The profile of customers was varied from first-time buyers to those already owning more than two cars. Their reasons for buying also varied: curiosity value, love of cars, affordability and ease of manoeuvrability on India's crowded roads. In some cases children were looking to buy the car for their elderly parents, some of whom had never owned a car before. But they couldn't actually drive away on Thursday. Rather, they were putting in an application to be among the first 100,000 owners, an order block that is expected to take more than a year to fill. Sixty-three year-old Vijay Jadav, a retired government employee, wants to buy a Nano to add to the Tata Indigo sedan he already owns. ""It's cheap, it's small and it's good for short journeys for a small family like ours,"" said the head of the family of four from Alibaug, about 150 kilometres south of Mumbai. Elavia H.M., 67, has never owned a car before and wants to buy the Nano for her son, who commutes to work in a taxi now. ""It is so cheap and ...it looks comfortable,"" she said. The Nano, at 3.09 metres in length, is smaller than the Maruti 800 but is 21 percent more spacious. It gets 23.6 kilometres to a litre of fuel, and its small turning radius of just 4 metres makes it easy to handle, especially in small parking lots and on narrow roads. ""I have experienced other foreign small cars, they are expensive to maintain and consume a lot of fuel. But look at Nano's mileage and we know Tata cars are cheaper on maintenance,"" said Denis Quadros, 42, who owns a Maruti Wagon R. This year and next will see a host of small cars being launched in India, starting with Honda's Jazz later this year and General Motors small compact car, scheduled to be launched towards the middle of the year. Volkswagen, Ford and Skoda are also planning to launch small cars for the Indian market starting in 2010.

Barcelona held on for 13 minutes of stoppage-time to beat South American champions LDU 2-1 in Ecuador and former Colombia coach Hernan Dario Gomez quit Bogota club Santa Fe after being insulted during another defeat. PERU Maestri, 36, failed to placate the fans despite scoring his first home goal since rejoining Cristal this season. The former Peru forward's 90th-minute goal was greeted with jeers and members of the hardcore supporters group continued to insult him when he left the field. The player known as ""The Tank"" helped Cristal win three successive domestic titles in the 1990s before joining arch-rivals Alianza Lima and he has never been forgiven by some supporters. ""I'm not bothered by this, I work for Cristal and it's the club which pays me,"" he said in a television interview. Provincial club Juan Aurich went top of the championship's first stage, beating previous leaders Universitario 2-0 with goals from Edinson Chara and Sergio Ibarra. ECUADOR Barcelona, the country's most popular club, hung on for only their third win of the season. Narciso Mina headed Barcelona ahead in the 26th minute but Claudio Bieler pounced on poor defending to level. Pablo Palacios had a penalty saved by Jose Cevallos but the hosts regained the lead through Raul Roman. The referee added on 14 minutes of stoppage-time after Barcelona goalkeeper Maximo Banguera was twice treated for cramp. COLOMBIA Gomez, who coached Colombia at the 1998 World Cup and led Ecuador to their first finals in 2002, quit Santa Fe after a 3-2 home defeat by Quindio left them 11th in the Apertura championship. ""I'm not a coach who wants to be badly treated and insulted,"" he said. ""I've coached a lot and I've always been respected."" Gomez had been in charge for 29 matches. La Equidad pulled off the weekend's most impressive win when they came from 3-1 down at Pereira to win 5-3 despite finishing with nine men. Diego Cochas scored twice for La Equidad while Wilson Carpintero, Efrain Viafara and Victor Giraldo shared the other goals. Hugo Soto was sent off in the 40th minute for a bad tackle and Dawling Leudo also saw red. Deportes Tolima, who nearly dropped out of the championship because of financial problems, stayed top with a 1-1 draw against Boyaca Chico. CHILE Champions Colo Colo slumped to their fourth successive league defeat when they lost 2-0 to Nublense and dropped to 15th in the Apertura championship.

""I'm ready to make the training camp permanent if I don't see the reaction I've asked for from the players,"" Lotito was quoted as saying by La Gazzetta dello Sport. The club president imposed the regime after ninth-placed Lazio's third consecutive defeat last week at Siena. Captain Francesco Totti is expected to play for sixth-placed Roma despite training separately from his team mates on Thursday because of an ongoing problem with his knee. Francesco Toldo is likely to be in goal for leaders Inter Milan against Palermo at the San Siro on Saturday (1300) after Julio Cesar strained a thigh muscle in last weekend's 1-0 win at Udinese. Cesar's Brazilian compatriots Maicon and Mancini are also injured. Out-of-sorts Brazil striker Adriano said on Thursday he was taking a break from soccer after failing to return to the Italian champions from international duty with Brazil last week. Juventus, who trail Inter by nine points, hope Claudio Marchisio will be available for Saturday's visit to fourth-placed Genoa (1830) after tests showed a knock to the midfielder's foot was nothing serious. Genoa will probably be without Argentina forward Diego Milito, whose 16 league goals have been instrumental in propelling the surprise packed to the fourth Champions League qualifying spot with eight games left, because of a leg problem.

Wide-ranging talks have taken place between executives at the companies, the blog reported, including discussion of the potential for Microsoft to handle Yahoo's search advertising business, and for Yahoo to combine and run the two companies' display advertising business. Microsoft and Yahoo declined to comment on the report. Expectation that the two technology giants would enter negotiations over Yahoo's search business has been rising since Yahoo's new CEO, Carol Bartz, took the reins in January. She succeeded Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang, who beat back Microsoft's effort to buy all of Yahoo last year for $47.5 billion, which soured relationships between the two companies. Microsoft wanted to buy Yahoo chiefly to combat Google Inc's dominance in the Internet search arena, and CEO Steve Ballmer has made it clear he would still like to do some sort of deal in that area.

United, who beat Porto to reach the Champions League semis after Cristiano Ronaldo's stunning goal, face Everton in their FA Cup semi-final on Sunday while Arsenal and Chelsea square up 24 hours earlier. With just over a month of an intriguing season remaining, all three clubs are chasing silverware on multiple fronts. Premier League leaders United are still on course for five trophies, having already won FIFA's Club World Cup and the League Cup, while Guus Hiddink's Chelsea have not given up on the league and face Barcelona in the Champions League semis. Arsenal, for all their early season problems, could end their four-year trophy drought with an FA Cup and Champions League double after crushing Villarreal on Wednesday to set up a European showdown with United. ""We know how good Chelsea are but if we play our football we can beat any team in the world,"" Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor said after scoring against Villarreal on Wednesday. Chelsea, who drew 4-4 with Liverpool on Tuesday to win an epic Champions League quarter-final 7-5 on aggregate, know they cannot afford to be as lax in defence as heir last two matches. They conceded three goals to Bolton Wanderers in the League last Saturday and four against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. Of the four semi-finalists, Arsenal appear to be the freshest with key players such as Cesc Fabregas, Theo Walcott and Eduardo returning from injuries at just the right time. WRITTEN OFF After being written off, manager Arsene Wenger's assertions that his Gunners young side would come good are proving accurate, even if the league is beyond them. ""These boys are winnersThe focus these players have shown since the beginning of the season has been fantastic,"" Wenger said this week. ""The hunger they have shown every single day in training and the focus they have shown is great."" While United, Arsenal and Chelsea all have their eyes on several prizes, Everton's focus is on the FA Cup and a place in next season's Europa League. They have lost only once in their last 11 matches. Everton, who beat United in the 1995 FA Cup final, have a doubt about French striker Louis Saha. Brazilian Jo is cup-tied while Nigerian Yakubu Aiyegbeni is out until next season with a ruptured Achilles. While the top sides chase FA Cup glory, attention in the Premier League switches to the bottom of the table where four teams battling against relegation all meet each other. Stoke City are only six points clear of the bottom three and face Blackburn Rovers, while 17th-placed Sunderland face 15th-placed Hull City.

She broke the news at a meeting with the representatives of the executive committee of Dhaka-based reporters' forum Dhaka Reporters Unity. Hasina spoke about plans to construct ring road and sky train and develop water routes to resolve traffic snarls. Steps for recession Hasina said a taskforce has been formed and grains have been stored to deal with the aftermaths of the global economic downturn. She observed that the price of essentials was within the reach of the people. The price of the rice being rationed has been decreased more and low-price rationing of staples for the police and ready-made garment workers is being arranged, Hasina said. Crisis and continuation The prime minister said lack of running water and electricity were 'big problems' the country was reeling under because the BNP-led coalition government halted projects her past 1996-2001 administration had taken. She said if the schemes of one government is not continued with and stopped by the next, these problems will creep up. ""We had installed Sayedabad water treatment plant and planned to make another treatment plant at Pagla. But the alliance government shut down that project. Had they implemented the project there would not be a water crisis,"" she said. Hasina was surprised that power outages were happening for hours on end and supply got interrupted every now and then. She suggested that if people were told beforehand about the timing and area of outages they could finish their job in time. ""The same thing happened when we took office in 1996. The BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami coalition government spent Tk 20,000 on the power sector but add not a single watt of electricity."" She alleged that the money was misappropriated through corruption. The prime minister said her government has moved to import electricity from Bhutan and spoke of plans for hydroelectricity, solar and wind power to feed into the national grid. ""We made a policy to add to gas and electricity production to meet increasing demand. But problem began when that was not followed,"" she said, referring to the failure of the BNP-led coalition government to raise gas production. She talked about the plans of her government to boost gas production and develop health, education, telecommunications, information technology services. The prime minister said her administration will develop the sport sector and stressed on elections to the sports federations to let competent people lead the sport sector and facilitate democratic environment. Measures for reporters The DRU delegation, led by its president Shamim Ahmed and general secretary Pothik Saha, sought her assistance in implementing plans for the development of the organisation. She pledged Tk 20 lakh in assistance and treatment of reporters in public hospitals on a priority basis. She also instructed officials to see the condition of the plot of the DRU office of.

They handed a cheque of Tk 51 lakh to her for the family members of army officers who died in February mutiny by BDR men at Peelkhana. They sought her government's support to save the export-focused textiles industry from global recession. Hasina assured them of the support and said in 1996 her government set up backward linkage industry and arranged for GSP facility for the development of textiles sector. She said her government wants to build mills on public-private partnership. When the textile mill owners asked for uninterrupted power and gas supply she said her administration was trying to resolve the crisis. The delegation presented a crest to the prime minister.

""Holding the national meet is not only to evaluate athletes' performance of the ongoing camp, but also search for new talent to include in the second-phase training camp,"" BOA vice-president and training committee chief Mizanur Rahman Manu told bdnews24.com on Sunday. Manu sees no problem to include new athletes as the SA Games is still nine months away from its scheduled time of 2010 January. The first-phase training got underway from January last with 17 disciplines and later six more disciplines were included raising the number to 23, the highest in the SA Games history since the inaugural Games in 1984 in Kathmandu. The national championship of most of the disciplines has already been completed and they were asked to submit the performance sheets to the training committee, which would assess the performance. So far seven federations -- weightlifting, swimming, karate, basketball, judo, squash and taekwondo -- have not completed their national meets that gave the BOA a headache as the training committee intends to cut the number of athletes. Some 744 athletes, including 186 women, from 23 disciplines have been taking part in the first-phase training and the BOA wants to cut the number of athletes to 600-625 before the start of the second phase in the middle of April. ""We will drop the athletes after evaluating their performance in the concluded national meets, but keep the squad in a sensible size so that they don't face players' shortage during practice,"" said the training committee head. Manu also added that they were also considering things such as injury, especially in the team events of football, cricket, hockey, kabaddi, volleyball, basketball and handball, before reducing the squad. Athletes of individual games like athletics, swimming, shooting, archery, karate, boxing, wrestling, weightlifting and taekwondo were having biomechanical tests for the first time to assess their mental and physical ability. Athletes from two more events wushu and golf also underwent biomechanical tests and the results are yet to be published. Manu hinted that the athletes would once again have such tests before the final phase training starts in August or September. BOA secretary general Kutubuddin Ahmed had earlier said that they were targeting 13 golds, two more than what Bangladesh bagged in the 1993 SA Games in Dhaka. bd"

en.15.119.426.2009.4.12,Pope calls for Israel-Palestinian peace,"VATICAN CITY, Sun Apr 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict called in his Easter message on Sunday for a renewed push for Israeli-Palestinian peace just weeks before he travels to the Holy Land for the first time as pontiff. The pope also sent greetings to survivors of Italy's devastating earthquake and urged all those fearful of their futures, for whatever reason, not to lose hope. ""At a time of world food shortage, of financial turmoil, of old and new forms of poverty ... it is urgent to rediscover grounds for hope,"" said the pontiff, wearing cream and gold-colored vestments. The pope celebrated an Easter Mass for tens of thousands of people gathered in St Peter's Square as Christians around the world commemorated Jesus Christ's resurrection. At the morning Mass, the pope told the faithful that the resurrection was a ""cry of victory that unites us all today."" Then, in his twice-yearly ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) address, the pope said he would carry a message of reconciliation on his May 8-15 trip to the Holy Land. ""Reconciliation -- difficult, but indispensable -- is a precondition for a future of overall security and peaceful coexistence,"" the pope said. ""It can only be achieved through renewed, persevering and sincere efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."" The German pope, who turns 82 this month, will visit the Jordanian capital Amman before heading for Jerusalem and Nazareth in Israel, and Palestinian-ruled Bethlehem. It will be the first trip by a pope to the Holy Land since Pope John Paul visited in 2000 and, at Jerusalem's Western Wall, asked God forgiveness for offences by Christians against Jews over the centuries. It follows the worst crisis in Catholic-Jewish relations in half a century after Benedict lifted the excommunication of British Bishop Richard Williamson, who said in January no more than 300,000 Jews perished in Nazi concentration camps, rather than the six million figure widely accepted by historians. Williamson also said he did not believe there had been any gas chambers at the concentration camps. The Easter celebrations at the Vatican took place at a time when many Italians have shifted their attention to victims of Monday's devastating earthquake, which killed at least 293 people. The pope, who says he plans to visit the disaster zone in nearby Abruzzo region soon, sent out greetings to those ""suffering from the earthquake."" On Good Friday, he prayed that survivors remain hopeful despite the tragedy. The earthquake made nearly 40,000 people home"
en.15.119.97.2009.4.16,Iran says has new proposals to end nuclear standoff,"TEHRAN/WASHINGTON, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Wednesday Iran had ready proposals to end a standoff with six world powers as Washington insisted it would not drop a demand that Tehran suspend uranium enrichment work. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said major powers had not had a response yet from Tehran for talks over its nuclear program and she had not seen ""any kind of proposal"" from Iran to resolve the stalemate over its nuclear plans. ""We have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve Iran's nuclear problem. It will be offered to the West soon,"" Ahmadinejad said in a televised speech in Iran's southeastern province of Kerman. The United States, Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain said last week they would ask European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana to invite Iran to a meeting to find ""a diplomatic solution to this critical issue."" It marked a significant shift in US policy under President Barack Obama, whose predecessor, George W. Bush, shunned direct talks with Tehran as long as it pressed ahead with uranium enrichment that the West believes is aimed at building a bomb but Iran says is for peaceful purposes. The Obama administration has said it will meet Iran ""without preconditions"" but Clinton, who met Solana in Washington on Wednesday, made clear the United States had not given up pushing for Tehran to suspend uranium enrichment. ""We have not dropped or added any conditions,"" she said, without elaborating. SANCTIONS TALK While seeking to engage Iran, the Obama administration has also warned of moves to impose tougher sanctions if Tehran keeps defying UN demands to halt sensitive nuclear work. ""We will stand behind the sanctions that have already been implemented and we will look for new ways to extend collective action vis a vis Iran's nuclear program,"" said Clinton. ""We will continue to work with our allies to make it clear that Iran cannot continue to pursue nuclear weapons."" On Monday, Iran welcomed a ""constructive"" dialogue with the six world powers, in its clearest signal that yet it would accept an invitation for talks on its nuclear activity. It was unclear whether Iran's counter-offer would be essentially different from previous ill-fated exchanges. Ahmadinejad did not give details of the new package, but said the world could not be ruled by ""using force."" ""This new package will ensure peace and justice for the world. It respects rights of all nations,"" he said. The six world powers originally offered Iran economic and political incentives in 2006 to suspend enrichment. Iran's response hinted at some flexibility but ruled out suspension as a precondition for talks as stipulated by the powers. Last June the six improved the offer while retaining the precondition. In reply, Iran said it wanted to negotiate a broader peace and security deal and rejected any ""condescending"" formula to shelve its nuclear program. Western officials said Iran's second response endorsed talks for talks' sake and was useless because it again sidestepped the suspension issue. ""OUT OF THE QUESTION"" They felt Iran was trying to buy time to expand and make irreversible its nuclear program. An Iranian official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that ""suspension is out of the question"" but that Iran did want to get talks rolling with major powers. ""Eventually Iran may agree to accept the (UN nuclear watchdog's) Additional Protocol,"" the official said. The protocol, which expands on the basic nuclear safeguards accords many countries have with the International Atomic Energy Agency, permits short-notice IAEA inspections beyond declared nuclear sites, to help verify no covert activity is going on. Iran stopped voluntarily implementing the Additional Protocol in 2006 in retaliation for initial UN sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic. Underlining Iran's intention to continue with its nuclear drive despite Western pressure, Ahmadinejad on April 9 inaugurated its first nuclear fuel fabrication plant and said the country had now mastered the entire fuel cycle"
en.15.119.399.2009.4.14,US muscle won't deter hardcore Somali pirates,"By William Maclean LONDON, Apr 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The U.S. rescue of an American sailor is unlikely to deter the most committed Somali pirates and could make future hijackings more violent, complicating efforts to tame the lawless seas off the Horn of Africa. Regional experts do not expect Washington to follow Sunday's operation with an assault on pirate redoubts onshore to end their defiance of an international flotilla of naval patrols. Not only would that endanger 260 other hostages, it could also play into the hands of Islamist militants and reduce Washington's clout in the peace-building that remains the only long-term solution to rebuilding the world's most failed state. But any move to militarize the overall U.S. approach to Somalia following the killing of three pirates in Sunday's rescue risks boosting anti-American feelings in a country already deeply suspicious of U.S. motives, experts say. That in turn could complicate the provision of international support to a fledgling transitional government that is trying to strengthen its authority and end 18 years of armed chaos. The U.S. military is alive to the dangers of escalation. Vice Admiral Bill Gortney, head of the U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet, said of the rescue: ""This could escalate violence in this part of the world, no question about it."" POLITICAL TENSIONS In Mogadishu, Hassan Mohamed, an activist of the Peace and Human Rights Network, said further U.S. armed action against pirates would stir political tensions already inflamed by a two-year Ethiopian occupation that ended only in January. ""The best solution is to support the Somali government so it can act against the pirates. If this is done the pirates can be destroyed,"" he said by telephone from Mogadishu. ""It's true that Somalis don't want these piracy problems: The gangsters who used to make problems for people with their checkpoints on land are now making problems for us out at sea."" ""But Americans have not been welcome in Somalia since they supported the Ethiopian invasion. The feeling is that Americans want to destroy us. The feeling is that America doesn't want Somalia to stand on its own two feet."" He said the best way for Washington to suppress piracy off Somalia was to help the country achieve stability onshore, where a young interim government headed by a moderate Islamist faces attacks by al Shabaab, an al Qaeda-aligned guerrilla force. Al Shabaab's main foe until the end of January was an Ethiopian occupation force sent into the country with tacit U.S. approval in 2006 to crush supposed al Qaeda activity. Experts say the pirates are well aware they would trigger painful Western retribution if they allied with al Shabaab. ""The pirates know that if they collude with al Qaeda or al-Shabaab that will be a game changer, and they like the game as played just fine,"" Somali expert Ken Mankhaus told a web discussion forum hosted by The Washington Post. Even in the short term, an increased Western military effort against the pirates would do little in practical terms to stop a lucrative ransom trade, analysts say. The seas are just too vast to be patrolled effectively and the incentives for the pirates and the powerful local business interests they serve are just too great. REVENGE CULTURE A Somali academic in Mogadishu said: ""Somalis are not intimidated by American muscle. Revenge culture is prevalent here: These guys will not fade away and say 'I'm going home'."" ""The American problem has always been 'short-term, quick fix, macho man'. It does not resolve the core issue,"" said the expert, who declined to be identified for security reasons. Washington should do more to help the new government extend its rule and counter fears it is in league with regional giant Ethiopia, Somalia's historic foe, the academic said. ""If it does not, then there are many reasons for piracy to continue. Number one, this is a gold rush -- death is not a deterrent. And number two, the people involved are not nobodies. There is investment in this by daring and committed people."" Commander Chris Davies of the NATO Maritime Component Command, a force combating Somalia piracy, said the Western response would be adapted as circumstances dictated but big changes in policy were unlikely. ""Thus far, it's not political. It's not fundamentalists. It's not terrorists. It's moneymaking,"" he said. ""That's the message we've picked up. The pattern has been that hostages have been treated very well. Broadly the worst we've seen is the occasional beating. ""You could arm the merchant ships but that has legal problems, and who's to say the pirates won't then escalate the situation? They have the money to buy more arms."" He said ships should continue to follow industry guidelines intended to reduce vulnerability: ""Inform the maritime authorities (of the voyage). Use the internationally-recognized (Gulf of Aden) transit corridor. Use speed. Use maneuvers. Use water cannon to deter attack. Keep a good looko"

""It can be settled in court,"" Khandaker Delwar Hossain told a protest rally in front of BNP's Naya Paltan headquarters. ""Without further clamour, take it to the court if the house is thought to be illegal. But, we will not accept Khaleda Zia being wrongly evicted. ""The government is going off the rails with the issue. If Khaleda Zia is evicted thus, the people will not accept it."" ""We said before, as we are saying still now, that the BNP believes in peaceful settlements. So, the government must take to the legal course. ""Threats won't work and their consequences won't be good,"" said the BNP leader, who has been most vocal on the issue since the cabinet announced its decision earlier this month to cancel the lease on the house. Arguing for Khaleda's legal right to the stay in the cantonment house, he said, ""Khaleda Zia has been residing in the house with legal documents giving her 'right of ownership'."" ""So, the cabinet's decision is wrong,"" said Delwar, who acted as BNP chief while Khaleda was put behind bars by the past caretaker government between 2007-2008. He called on the government to avoid ""the vindictive path"" and cancel the cabinet decision. He repeated his previous allegation the government was raising this issue to divert people's attention away from ""the government's failures"" in resolving various problems, including the BDR crisis. After former president Ziaur Rahman's death in a 1981coup, the then president Abdus Sattar leased the cantonment to widow Khaleda Zia.

en.15.119.324.2009.4.16,"Inflation near zero, may help ease rates","NEW DELHI, Thu Apr 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The annual inflation rate headed towards zero in early April, which could give the central bank room to cut interest rates when it reviews policy next week. Although there were upward price pressures in some items such as food, manufactured products and fuel, analysts said they expected the inflation rate would soon turn negative due to the high prices last year. The wholesale price index, India's most widely watched inflation measure, rose 0.18 percent in the 12 months to April 4, below the previous week's rise of 0.26 percent and above a forecast for a fall of 0.18 percent in a Reuters poll. ""Although higher price pressure from primary articles and fuel price indices have kept inflation in the positive terrain, I think it is only a matter of time for inflation to dip to negative,"" said Anubhuti Sahay, economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. ""We still expect rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of India by June 2009, and repo rate could go down to 4 percent while the reverse repo rate may be at 3 percent."" The central bank has cut its main short-term lending rate by 400 basis points in five moves since October, and the central bank has called on banks to pass the lower rates on to customers. A Reuters poll showed analysts are almost evenly split over whether the central bank would cut its key lending rates at its review on Tuesday. The wholesale price based-inflation rate has fallen sharply since peaking at just under 13 percent in August, but annual consumer price inflation in February was 9.63 percent, as prices of food products remain firm. Financial markets largely remained cool to the data with the benchmark 10-year bond yield briefly rising half a basis point to 6.53 percent, while the partially convertible rupee was unchanged at 49.5050/51 per dollar. Some analysts said the annual inflation rate masked a strong trend in price pressures over the past few weeks. ""The index has increased significantly on a week-on-week basis, which means the pressure emanating from primary articles prices, especially vegetables, fruit, edible oil, are exerting significant upward pressure on the wholesale price index,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda. ""Though on a year-on-year basis because of the high statistical base we are seeing a continuous drop in inflation, the spike in prices week-on-week is pretty h"
en.15.119.255.2009.4.13,Barcelona wary of Bayern's wounded pride,"BERLIN, April 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona take a 4-0 advantage to Munich but are wary of Bayern's wounded pride when they face the Germans on Tuesday in their Champions League quarter-final return leg. Barca coach Pep Guardiola warned their high scoring victory in Spain last week could bring the best out of the German champions, who have called the defeat a debacle and said they have no real chance of qualifying. ""Bayern are capable of scoring four goals, all the more so when they are wounded,"" Guardiola said at a news conference. ""I don't believe the statements about them already having given the tie up for lost,"" he said. ""I am sure they will put in a good performance and we have to go there with a lot of ambition to win the match. If we are speculative they will roll over us."" Guardiola left key players, including midfielder Xavi, Primera Liga top scorer Samuel Eto'o and captain Carles Puyol, out of his starting line-up for Saturday's comfortable 2-0 home win over struggling Recreativo Huelva. The former Barca and Spain midfielder will have to watch the match from the stands after being dismissed from the bench in the first leg and seeing his appeal with UEFA rejected. ""I'll be in the stands but it does not matter, it is something completely secondary,"" he said. Barca central defender Rafael Marquez is suspended after picking up a yellow card at the Nou Camp. BAYERN PRIDE Bayern, who had not lost in the Champions League this season before last week's defeat, have said the team has an obligation to restore the club's pride. Boosted by their 4-0 crushing of Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, the Germans are looking to bow out with their heads held high. ""With this win (against Frankfurt) we repaired part of the damage but not all of it. We have a lot to do on Tuesday so that we can say goodbye to the competition in a good way,"" coach Juergen Klinsmann said. Klinsmann is again expected to field 34-year-old keeper Hans Joerg Butt, ahead of Michael Rensing, who had been his first choice throughout the season until last week. ""Unfortunately I have to hurt Michael and put his development on the backburner so we can get the results we need to get,"" the coach, in his first season at Bayern, said. Klinsmann, under fire for his team's erratic performances throughout the season, will have a largely fit squad with only central defender Daniel van Buyten in doubt. Defenders Lucio and Philipp Lahm, who both missed the first leg through injury, should be fit to play. Probable teams: Bayern Munich: 22-Hans Joerg Butt; 23-Massimo Oddo, 6-Martin Demichelis, 3-Lucio, 21-Philipp Lahm; 8-Hamit Altintop, 31-Bastian Schweinsteiger, 17-Mark van Bommel, 15-Ze Roberto, 7-Franck Ribery; 9-Luca Toni Barcelona: 1-Victor Valdes; 20-Daniel Alves, 3-Gerard Pique, 5-Carles Puyol, 16-Silvinho; 6-Xavi, 24-Yaya Toure, 8-Andres Iniesta; 10-Lionel Messi, 9-Samuel Eto'o, 14-Thierry Henry.

Chelsea recovered to draw a remarkable quarter-final 4-4 and go through to a semi-final against Barcelona 7-5 on aggregate after a superb second-half fightback. ""We lost our tempers but the players themselves were not happy either with the way we had played,"" Hiddink told reporters. ""We didn't start as we planned and we know playing against a team as skilful and tactically aware as Liverpool you cannot give them a lot of space and we gave them to much but the focus was on duels we lost too many in the first half which is another reason tactically we did not pay well."" Hiddink unusually made a first-half substitution when he replaced forward Salomon Kalou with Nicolas Anelka and the move paid off handsomely in the second half when the Frenchman set up Didier Drogba to score Chelsea's first goal. ""I have been involved in some (dramatic games) but this was one of these games where everyone has made a lot of errors and that's why it was so attractive it was going from one end to the other,"" Hiddink said. ""It is very dramatic when you think you are down and then you come up then your down again you are in the game and then you are out of it."" Chelsea reached the semi-finals for the fifth time in six seasons and were playing Liverpool for the fifth consecutive year in the Champions League. Rafa Benitez, who led Liverpool in the 2005 final against AC Milan when they fought back from trailing 3-0 at halftime to win on penalties, nearly master-minded another amazing comeback.

en.15.119.249.2009.4.11,<blink><font color=red>ANALYSIS</font></blink><br>Immigration offers US an economic balm,"ANALYSIS By Diana Furchtgott-Roth Washington Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)It's welcome news that President Obama will turn his attention to immigration reform this year, as was announced on Wednesday by deputy assistant to the president Cecilia Muoz. Economic recovery will happen more quickly if both high- and low-skill immigrants are permitted to enter the United States and work legally. Two years ago, when Congress was considering comprehensive immigration reform, both President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and the Congressional Budget Office, headed by Peter Orszag, an economist closely identified with the Democratic Party, estimated that the benefits of additional immigrants outweighed the costs. If Congress allowed more immigration, then American taxpayers would come out ahead financially. Yet, after Congress refused to pass President Bush's plan to allow most undocumented workers to receive work visas and wait in line for citizenship, the Bush administration's immigration policy deteriorated into a series of arbitrary raids on different companies, rounding up undocumented workers and deporting them, in many cases separating husbands and wives, parents and children. We can do better. Although the unemployment rate reached 8.5 percent last month, the jobs are going to come back, and, as has been the case in the past, native-born Americans will want jobs that are different from those of immigrants, according to economics professor Giovanni Peri of the University of California at Davis. Congress needs to overhaul immigration law and create an expanded temporary worker program with a path to citizenship, along with more verification to prevent workers from working illegally, and monitoring of tourists and students so that they do not overstay their visas. A rational immigration policy would have numerous advantages: - Undocumented workers would pay taxes to federal and state governments rather than to grey-market check cashing services. - Payments for health care through insurance could be collected more easily, rather than burdening hospital emergency rooms with immigrants without health insurance. - Foreigners who want to work here could pay the government for visas rather than pay smugglers for unsafe, illicit transportation. - Improvements in security. Legal visas and bank accounts would make it far easier to identify and track potential terrorists, dubious financial transactions, and those who simply overstay visas. A rational immigration policy would solve several real problems the United States faces with regard to immigration. The international economy is tremendously dynamic; our immigration system is not. Temporary workers must spend months applying for admission, and due to the pile-up in April of every year, may not even get a visa. Few low-skilled workers have a legal and reliable method to enter this country and work legally, and few Americans want to do the jobs, such as fruit picking and cleaning, that these workers want to pursue. And even high-skilled workers trained at U.S. colleges and universities, often at taxpayer expense, might have to wait years and spend thousands of dollars to become permanent residents of the nation. Obama might want to consider transferring the authority of setting quotas from Congress to the Labor Department. The Labor Department already has the presumptive authority to judge whether demand for foreign labor is justified, through its foreign labor certifications. If the Labor Department is allowed to determine whether or not a foreign worker would displace a native one, it could also be allowed to calculate visa quotas. High-skilled workers educated in America ought to be able to stay; otherwise, our investment in their education becomes lost to another country. If the Labor Department determines that a foreign worker would not displace Americans, that worker should not be barred from entering the country due to an arbitrary quota. And people who want to enter this country in order to work in jobs Americans are not willing to take ought to have an easy, legal way to do so. Obama has the opportunity to craft a sensible and dynamic immigration system. All Americans should wish him success.

A spokesman for the project said it will be the first city to use only solar power during the day, producing more than it needs so becoming a net exporter of solar power too. In addition to having its electricity generated from solar energy, the entire city is expected to have wireless Internet access and electric-car chargers. FPL Group Inc's utility Florida Power & Light is working with the realty group Kitson & Partners to construct what the utility says will be the world's largest photovoltaic solar plant in a planned, environmentally friendly city near Fort Myers in southwestern Florida. Called Babcock Ranch, the city will aim to build 19,500 houses and about 6 million square feet of retail, light industrial, and office space when it is completed, the developers said. The entire project is expected to cost $2 billion. Syd Kitson, chief executive of Kitson & Partners, said Babcock, which will help create 20,000 jobs, can serve as a model for other communities throughout the nation. ""Babcock Ranch will be a living laboratory for companies, workers and families ready to reap the rewards of innovation,"" Kitson said at a press conference introducing the project. Construction of the city center is scheduled to begin in June 2010, with the first residential and commercial buildings targeted for late 2010. With the United States reeling from recession and falling housing prices, U.S. President Barack Obama has pledged to create millions of jobs by moving the country toward a green-energy economy. Florida, in particular, has suffered from the housing bust. The state is now staggering under high mortgage foreclosure rates, dropping home prices and slowing population growth. Obama wants 10 percent of U.S. electricity generated by renewable sources such as wind and solar power by 2012 and 25 percent by 2025. The stimulus package Obama signed into law earlier this year included billions of dollars for clean energy investments. The utility and realty developers said they were not planning on using stimulus money for the projects at this point. Groundbreaking for the $350 million to $400 million plant will begin late this year subject to state regulatory approvals, Eric Silagy, chief development officer for Florida Power & Light, said at the conference. Silagy said the state government of Florida has been extremely supportive of renewable energy and he was optimistic about winning approval for this new plant. ""We have three projects that are under construction and I think that's evidence that they are very committed to this,"" Silagy said. ""With that continued commitment we'll be able to move forward with project very quickly."" Florida Power and Light said the construction of its plant will not be dictated by the status of the planned c"
en.15.119.432.2009.4.13,Obama urged to lead battle against Somali pirates,"MOGADISHU, Mon Apr 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The crew of a US ship attacked off Somalia called on President Barack Obama to lead the battle to stamp out piracy on Monday, after US forces freed the ship's captain to end a five-day hostage drama. Navy snipers shot dead three Somali pirates holding Captain Richard Phillips in a drifting lifeboat circled by US warships. Other pirates vowed revenge on Americans. More than 250 hostages of many nationalities are still being held along the Somali coast by pirates who have seized dozens of vessels, from tankers to yachts, in recent months. Helicopters once again flew over pirate bases near Eyl on the Somali coast overnight after Phillips' rescue. ""They killed our friends on the lifeboat and we thought helicopters would bomb us in Eyl last night,"" a pirate in Eyl, who called himself Farah, told Reuters. ""We were mourning for dead friends and then roaring planes came -- grief upon grief. America has become our new enemy."" The U.S. Navy said the decision to shoot Phillips' kidnappers was a split-second one, taken because he appeared to be in ""imminent danger."" ""They were pointing the AK-47s at the captain,"" Vice Admiral William Gortney, head of the U.S. Naval Central Command, said. ""The on-scene commander took it as the captain was in imminent danger and then made that decision and he had the authorities to make that decision and he had seconds to make that decision."" A fourth pirate was captured alive. President Barack Obama granted the Pentagon's request for standing authority to use appropriate force, Gortney said. Phillips, captain of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama container ship, contacted his family after the rescue, received a medical check, and rested aboard the USS Boxer. CREW JUBILANT His crew set off flares, hoisted an American flag and jumped for joy at the news of their captain's rescue. They called on Obama to take the lead in combating piracy. ""America has to be in the forefront to put an end to this crisis ... This crew was lucky to be out of it with everyone alive. We are not going to be that lucky again,"" first nautical officer Shane Murphy told reporters in Kenya's Mombasa port. Phillips was the first American taken by pirates who have plundered ships in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean for years. An Italian tugboat hijacked in the Gulf of Aden arrived at Las Qoray on the north Somali coast on Sunday, residents said. ""Well-armed pirates on the tugboat ordered us to keep away from areas near them. Two of the pirates came down to town to persuade residents to allow them to stay but I don't know the outcome,"" fisherman Jama Feysal told Reuters by phone. The tug, carrying 10 Italians, 5 Romanians and a Croatian, was seized on Saturday. Mohamed Salah Dubeys, a Somaliland military commander, said the pirates were also holding two Egyptian ships with 24 other hostages in the area. Obama, spared another thorny foreign policy crisis to add to his problems with the U.S. economic meltdown and the war in Afghanistan, vowed to curb piracy. ""To achieve that goal, we must continue to work with our partners to prevent future attacks, be prepared to interdict acts of piracy and ensure that those who commit acts of piracy are held accountable for their crimes,"" he said in a statement. U.S. congressman Donald Payne flew to Mogadishu on Monday, making what is believed to be the first visit to the Somali capital by a senior American politician since 1994. Mortars were fired at him as he left by plane. PIRATES VOW REVENGE Somali pirates vowed to avenge the US shootings of their comrades, as well as a French military assault to rescue a yacht on Friday in which two pirates were killed and three captured. ""The French and the Americans will regret starting this killing. We do not kill, but take only ransom. We shall do something to anyone we see as French or American from now,"" Hussein, a pirate, told Reuters by satellite phone. The Maersk Alabama, carrying food aid for Somalis, was attacked far out in the Indian Ocean on Wednesday, but its 20 American crew regained control. Phillips volunteered to go with the pirates in a lifeboat in exchange for the crew's safety. ""The actions of Captain Phillips and the civilian mariners of Maersk-Alabama were heroic,"" Gortney said. ""Captain Phillips selflessly put his life in the hands of these armed criminals in order to protect his crew."" Friends of the pirates told Reuters they wanted $2 million. Local elder Ismail Haji Ahmed told Reuters by phone from the coastal village of Eyl, a notorious pirate base: ""Roaring helicopters terrified us so much that no one slept last night. ""If we could flee from Eyl, the planes could bomb the pirates. We were confined to our houses and could not even go to latrines."" So far, pirates have generally treated hostages well, sometimes roasting goat meat for them and even letting them phone loved ones. The worst violence has been the occasional beating. No hostages are known to have been killed by pir"
en.15.119.429.2009.4.15,Germany to ban cultivation of GMO maize: Minister,"BERLIN/HAMBURG, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany will ban cultivation and sale of genetically modified (GMO) maize, German Agriculture Minister Ilse Aigner said on Tuesday. The ban affects U.S. biotech company Monsanto's MON 810 maize which may no longer be sown for this summer's harvest, Aigner told a news conference. MON 810 maize is the only GM crop currently approved by the EU for commercial use. ""I have come to the conclusion that there is a justifiable reason to believe that genetically modified maize of the type MON 810 presents a danger to the environment,"" Aigner said. Monsanto declined immediate comment. Aigner, who took office in October 2008, said previously she would review approval for cultivation of GMO maize in Germany before this year's sowing took place in late April. Monsanto gave German authorities a report on compliance with cultivation rules at the end of March. German authorities had given Aigner differing assessments of the report, the minister said. But the Environment Ministry also believed GMOs presented a threat to the environment. The decision to ban was based on scientific factors and was not a political decision, Aigner said. It was an individual case and not a fundamental decision against GMO crops, she added. Her ministry would now prepare a report into Germany's strategy on GMO crops. Aigner stressed that five other European Union countries have banned GMO maize cultivation in the face of EU approvals. Aigner's decision was welcomed by German environmentalist association BUND. ""The suspicions that genetic maize damages nature and animals are so widespread that a ban is absolutely necessary,"" BUND chairman Hubert Weiger said. Environmental group Greenpeace called on Aigner to work inside the EU to stop further approvals of GMO maize. A series of scientific studies had shown that GMO maize was dangerous to the environment, Greenpeace spokeswoman Stephanie Toewe said. German farmers have registered intentions to cultivate some 3,600 hectares of maize for the 2009 harvest, up from 3,200 hectares in 2008. But the total is an insignificant part of Germany's annual maize cultivation of around 1.8 to 2.0 million hectares. bd"

""It will be finalised after open discussion with all stakeholders,"" he said, at a discussion with top business leaders, organised by the committee on import policy, at the Dhaka Sheraton. Faruq invited cooperation from those present with the current ""business-friendly government"". He also urged businessmen to refrain from ""making money at people's expense"".

They had earlier blockaded the Zigatola crossing in Dhanmondi to press home demands, which they said had been ""repeatedly ignored"" by college authorities. Scores of protesting students gathered at the crossing from their Hazaribagh campus, blocking it to traffic, at around 10:45am. Police, charging with batons, managed to clear the road at around midday. Chased by the police, students smashed a number of vehicles and a business premise. Some four to ten people, including students and police, were injured before the students eventually returned to the college campus. Police remained deployed outside the campus until late afternoon. College principal Fazlul Karim told bdnews24.com by phone that he was ""not in a position to attend the college for the current deadlock"", but asserted full support towards students' lawful demands. He alleged that despite their all-out efforts to address the demands of the students, they had kept the teachers hostage, but the proesting students denied the allegation. ""We took to the street as the authorities turned a deaf ear to our long-standing demands,"" said third year student Assaduzzaman. Asaduzzaman told bdnews24.com they had repeatedly notified their demands to the principal. ""But he ignored them."" They placed their demands to the college authority most recently on April 5, but the authority took no steps, he said. ""The situation will return to normalcy once our demands are met."" said Marjan Amin, another third year student. They denied holding teachers hostage inside the campus The students' demands include awarding the students engineering degrees under the engineering and technology faculty of Dhaka University, relocation of the exam centre to the college campus, keeping form fees within Tk 5,000 and hold exams on schedule. Principal Fazlul K said that the college had talks with Dhaka University and reached a decision to cut form fees. He also said they were trying to meet the remaining demands. Assistant commissioner of police Mokhlesur Rahman told reporters that some half a dozen students and police were injured earlier during the agitation at Zigatola crossing. bdne"

""[Khaleda] has spent 28 years of her widowed life in that house since her husband's death,"" Delwar told reporters at his Armanitola home. ""Today, if the government evicts her by an illegal decision, we'll handle that politically."" He warned that the government would have to take responsibility for any untoward happenings that might arise. Delwar criticised the government for cancelling the lease on the house. Since her husband's killing, [Khaleda] has been living in that house which had been leased to her as per an unanimous decision by the second parliament in 1981, he added.. The residents still held the house deed and all legal papers based on which the Cantonment Board had handed it to Zia family, he said. He trashed the allegations raised by law minister Shafiq Ahmed and commerce minister Faruq Khan that Khaleda's occupation of the house had been illegal. He once again asked the government to rescind the 'erratic' decision. ""The onus usually is not on the cabinet of ministers to cancel a house allotment to an individual. It was done to compel the Cantonment Board to execute it."" He alleged that as BNP had cancelled the government decision of allotting Ganobhaban, a state property, to Sheikh Hasina, prime minister in 2001, the government now vengefully cancelled the lease on Khaleda's residence. The secretary-general said the government was failing to deliver on its election commitments and trying to divert people's attention to minor issues. ""The prime minister has not been able to transcend meanness. The government will not be able to bring in promised changes unless its leaders change their mindset,"" Delwar observed. b"

US Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice and her Japanese counterpart Yukio Takasu both called the meeting ""productive."" ""Our work continues,"" Rice told reporters after the 40-minute meeting. Takasu said he looked forward to a ""strong and unified message from the Security Council"", adding that Tokyo had not changed its position that a legally binding resolution would be better than a nonbinding statement in response to the launch. He added that the meeting ""was very productive and we agreed to continue consultations"". The United States, Japan and South Korea say North Korea launched a long-range ballistic missile on Sunday, not a satellite, in violation of a Security Council resolution banning the firing of such missiles. Japan has been pushing for a council resolution that would declare Pyongyang in violation of resolution 1718, but Russia and China, which are permanent veto-wielding council members, oppose this. They are not convinced the rocket launch, which North Korea says put a satellite into orbit, was a violation. UN diplomats say negotiations on a UN response have been deadlocked for days, with neither the Chinese nor Japanese showing much willingness to compromise. Washington, they say, has indicated it might be willing to accept a nonbinding statement rather than a resolution, which the Americans fear might take too long, if one can be agreed at all. But Japan's delegation insists on getting a resolution, fearing failure to get one would result in heavy domestic criticism, diplomats say. The meeting followed talks between Japan's vice foreign minister Shintaro Ito and China's UN envoy Zhang Yesui. Ito, who came to New York to take part in discussions on North Korea, told reporters earlier that ""Japan needs a resolution"" that would condemn the rocket launch. It was not immediately clear after Thursday's meetings if Japan and the five permanent council members -- United States, Britain, France, China and Russia -- were any closer to a compromise that would enable the full 15-nation council to pass a resolution or statement soon responding to the launch.

en.15.119.161.2009.4.13,Japan PM support reaches 30 percent: NHK,"TOKYO, Mon Apr 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Support for Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso rose to 30 percent in an opinion poll released on Monday, a level political analysts have said was the minimum needed for the leader to call a snap election. Some lawmakers in Aso's long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party are urging him to call an election in May or June to take advantage of his improved popularity and a funding scandal plaguing his main opposition rival, but others remain cautious about rushing to call a vote that must be held by October. The poll by NHK public TV, which showed Aso's support rate had risen 12 points from last month, follows North Korea's launch of a rocket over Japan, seen by Tokyo as a thinly disguised missile test, and the government's unveiling of a record 15 trillion yen ($154 billion ) stimulus package for the recession-hit economy. The Democrats had looked poised to win the general election and topple the LDP until party leader Ichiro Ozawa's aide was arrested and charged last month with illegal fundraising. An opposition victory would end over a half-century of nearly unbroken rule by the conservative LDP and bring to power a party vowing to stress worker and consumer rights over corporate interests while reducing bureaucrats' grip on policy decisions. But in the latest worrying sign for Ozawa, an opposition-backed candidate lost a closely watched local election at the weekend, a defeat that could increase pressure on the veteran politician to resign ahead of the nationwide vote. BRIGHTER MOOD FOR LDP His party's loss in the vote for governor of Akita prefecture in northern Japan follows a similar defeat last month near Tokyo, eroding Ozawa's image as a skilled campaign strategist. While some ruling party lawmakers were optimistic about the local election result, others were more cautious. ""It does make the mood bright, but this does not clearly show support for the LDP or the cabinet,"" Makoto Koga, the LDP's de facto campaign manager, told reporters. In the NHK poll, 19 percent said Aso would be more appropriate as prime minister compared to 14 percent who chose Ozawa. But 60 percent found neither an appealing choice. Another public opinion poll by the Mainichi newspaper published on Sunday also showed Aso outranking Ozawa, who has stayed on as party leader despite surveys showing a majority of voters would prefer him to step down. Around three-quarters of voters in the Mainichi survey wanted Ozawa to quit as leader of the Democrats. But the same survey showed 42 percent of respondents wanted the Democrats to win the general election, while 32 percent wanted the LDP to win. ""The situation is tough. It might be better if Ozawa quits,"" said a Democratic Party assemblyman in Tokyo after the results of the Akita election were known. ""But it's a tough call."" Media quoted LDP Secretary-General Hiroyuki Hosoda as saying the election result was a sign voters supported the party's economic poli"

""All members of the committee agreed that out of the total allocated Tk 181 crore for Gram Sarker, Tk 135 crore was wasted,"" chairman Rahmat Ali told bdnews24.com after a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on local government. ""I have talked to the minister who assured me that his ministry will carry out investigation in line with the standing committee's recommendations,"" he said. ""We have asked the ministry to collect information on sector-wise spending of the Gram Sarker funds over the last four fiscal years"". The Awami League, the then main opposition party in parliament, opposed the passage of the controversial Gram Sarker (Village Government) bill in 2003, which created another local government body comprising of mainly selected members below the Union Parishad, the then lowest tier of local government. Awami League alleged Gram Sarker was created to give facilities to grassroots BNP leaders and activists, an allegation vehemently denied by the then ruling party. BNP said the Gram Sarker was created to supplement the development initiatives of the Union Parishad. The then government allocated Tk 20 crore, Tk 40 crore, Tk 60 crore and Tk 61 crore in the 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06 and 1006-07 fiscal years. The Gram Sarker was also vested with the authority to settle villages disputes. The immediate past caretaker government, through an ordinance in 2007, annulled the controversial Gram Sarker, which at one point was also declared illegal by the High Court. The Awami League government upheld the decision of the caretaker government and repealed the Gram Sarker Act through a bill on March 15 this year. Standing committee members Noor-e-Lam Chowdhury, AKM Mostafizur Rahman, Md Ali Ashraf Khan Khasru and Md Abul Khayer Bhuiyan also attended Thursday's meeting."
en.15.119.46.2009.4.13,India to kick off month-long general election,"NEW DELHI Mon Apr 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India holds the first stage on Thursday of a staggered general election that could see the ruling Congress party returned to power at the head of a weak coalition just as the Asian power suffers an economic slowdown. The left-of-centre Congress-led alliance is battling for re-election against a grouping led by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a third front of regional and communist parties. More than 700 million people will be able to vote from a myriad of castes, classes and regions, ranging from the hi-tech hub of Bangalore to the Ganges plains where some ""untouchables"" still cannot drink from the same wells as upper castes. The outcome will be known on May 16 after five vote stages. India's elections are notoriously hard to predict, but many pollsters expect a hung parliament leading to an unstable coalition. Exit polls have been banned for the election. ""The race is wide open,"" said Yashwant Deshmukh, head of the C-Voter Polling Agency. ""The chances of a weak coalition are high."" Many polls tip Congress as the most likely victor, but it could depend on the parliamentary support of an unstable coalition of regional parties. That could rock confidence in India as it deals with a slowdown that has cost millions of jobs, a rising fiscal deficit and tensions with Pakistan after the Mumbai attacks in November. India's middle classes may shop with credit cards for LCD televisions in gleaming malls, but politicians are appealing to the millions perceived to have been left out by a boom in a country where malnutrition in some places is worse than sub-Saharan Africa. Ancient caste, linguistic and regional ties will also play a huge role in determining how people vote. In some northern states, the issues of elephants trampling on farmers and the dangers of swarms of mosquitoes have been key to campaigns. A HUNG PARLIAMENT? Analysts say the two main national parties, Congress and BJP, may both fare badly, leading to a hung parliament in which smaller regional, caste-based groups and the communists could hold the balance of power or form the government. ""For the first time in 60 years, the combined tally of the two main national parties may be under half the number of votes,"" said Deshmukh. A Reuters poll of 14 analysts said a Congress victory was most likely, but that regional parties, known as the Third Front, were gaining momentum. The possibility of a hung parliament could mean the election is decided by backroom dealings in the weeks after the elections, perhaps leading to a short-lived and unstable government. That frightens many investors in India, who believe the country needs quick economic reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws, to ensure India continues to grow and compete with China, as well as dealing with a rising fiscal deficit. Rahul Gandhi, 38-year-old scion of India's most powerful family dynasty, has appeared to lead Congress's campaign, flying by helicopter across the country with a populist message of reaching out to India's ""common man"". But Congress's candidate for the premiership is once again Prime Minister Mamohan Singh, 76, a respected elder statesman who has forged closer ties with Washington while steering an economy that has grown at 9 percent for the last four years. BJP leader L.K Advani, 81, is his main contender, but analysts say his campaign may have lost shine amid controversy over his support for some radical Hindu members, raising fears of communal tensions with India's minority Muslims. A hung parliament could spring a surprise leader from a smaller party such as Mayawati, the ""Queen of the Untouchables"", who bases her support among many of the poor of northern India. The first stage will be centred on the eastern and northern belt of India marked by deep poverty and a Maoist insurgency. Strips of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, two states that account for 120 of 543 seats in parliament, will vote on Thursday, as well as the insurgency hit states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. As many as 22,000 rebels are fighting Indian security forces in this belt of India. More than 1,000 cases of Maoist attacks were recorded last year in which more than 200 security personnel and 300 civilians were killed. ""This first phase takes place in some of the most backward areas of India,"" said Sudheendra Kulkarni, a top election strategist for the BJP. ""Of course caste ties are important, but the issues of development and infrastructure will be import"

""He went through a lot of pain today in the transportation,"" John Demjanjuk Jr. said of his 89-year-old father. ""But he's nevertheless relieved to be home rather than on a plane to Germany, and we're very grateful that the federal 6th Circuit Court of Appeals sees the merit in our appeal to have this reviewed and this inhumane action put to a stop."" Earlier, agents descended on his suburban home, brought in a doctor and, after a check, loaded the retired auto worker into a van in his wheelchair as his weeping wife stood by. A priest was present briefly before he was escorted out. He had been scheduled to be flown immediately to Munich, where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 Jews but instead was taken to a federal building in downtown Cleveland. A Justice Department spokesman said it ""will continue to litigate this matter in court."" Prosecutors in Germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at Sobibor death camp, where he is alleged to have personally led Jews to the gas chambers at the camp in Polish territory then occupied by Nazi Germany. John Demjanjuk Jr. drove four hours to Cincinnati to deliver an 11th-hour appeal to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that deporting his ailing father to Germany amounted to torture and that the trip alone might kill him. Two judges from the federal appeals court in Cincinnati ordered the deportation stopped while it weighed whether Demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors' response that the legal case was at an end. Ed Nishnic, Demjanjuk's former son-in-law, said the family had been told he was being taken initially to a federal building in Cleveland. ""He understood he was being taken against his will ... it's disappointing to watch a human being treated like that,"" he said, adding that the agents used a van and not an ambulance. LONG SAGA The events were the latest and perhaps last phase of a story played out on three continents over nearly 70 years. The Ukraine native was sentenced to death in Israel in 1988 as the sadistic guard ""Ivan the Terrible"" at Treblinka where 870,000 died. Israel's highest court later ruled that he was not ""Ivan"" of Treblinka. After spending years in an Israeli prison, he returned to his home near Cleveland in 1993 and his citizenship was restored in 1998. At the time, the appeals court in Cincinnati reprimanded the Justice Department for concealing evidence that would have exonerated him in the Ivan case. U.S. Justice Department Nazi hunters reopened the case, and a US court convicted him in 2002 of working at three other camps and he was stripped of his citizenship a second time. Germany's chief Nazi war crimes investigator, Kurt Schrimm, urged Demjanjuk be prosecuted in Munich, where Demjanjuk lived before he emigrated. Prosecutors there issued an arrest warrant in March and asked the United States to deport him. Demjanjuk was scheduled to be deported on April 5 but won a stay, saying he had spinal problems, kidney failure and anemia, was very weak and needed help to stand up. The US Board of Immigration Appeals last week revoked the stay. Demjanjuk has denied any role in the Holocaust. He said he was drafted into the Russian army in 1941, became a German prisoner of war a year later and served at German prison camps until"

She told the officials to revive Chittagong Chemical Industries and Khulna Newsprint Mill and said her administration wanted to build industries on private-public partnership. ""It beats me if the mills and industries in the private sector can make money then why the state-owned mills cannot profit despite having all facilities,"" she said at a meeting at the ministry Sunday. She said her previous 1996-2001 government had faced pressure from the donors to privatise all state-owned mills. ""There were talks of shutting down Adamjee Jute Mills, Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory, Khulna Shipyard and BRTC. We handed Machine Tools Factory to the army and the shipyard to the navy. Both institutes are now doing well."" She referred to the changing scenario of world economy and said industries should be built by the government as well as private entrepreneurs to rev up and regulate economy. She emphasised on reviving Chittagong and Khulna as industrial hubs by setting up more mills and industries.

en.15.119.428.2009.4.12,Iniesta inspires Barca to 2-0 win over Recre,"MADRID, April 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A first-minute strike from Andres Iniesta and a Nasief Morris own goal gave Barcelona a 2-0 win over Recreativo Huelva on Saturday, a fifth straight victory that stretches their lead over Real Madrid to nine points. Barca move to 75 points with eight matches left, while second-placed Real, who host Real Valladolid on Sunday, are on 66. Sevilla, in third, are nine behind champions Real and play at home to struggling Getafe on Sunday. Barca coach Pep Guardiola left midfielder Xavi, Primera Liga top scorer Samuel Eto'o and captain Carles Puyol out of the starting line-up following Wednesday's 4-0 thrashing of Bayern Munich in their Champions League quarter-final first leg. Thierry Henry was in his usual position on the left wing and it was his surging run that created the opening goal in the first minute, Iniesta sidefooting the Frenchman's low cross past stranded Recre goalkeeper Asier Riesgo. Sebastian Nayar had a chance to put relegation-threatened Recre level shortly after but his close-range shot was smothered by Riesgo's opposite number Victor Valdes. South African defender Morris cleared a Lionel Messi shot off the line and Henry had an effort ruled out for offside before the home side doubled their lead on 68 minutes when Iniesta's attempted cross ricocheted in off Morris. ""A BIT UGLY"" Guardiola said the victory had been ""a bit ugly"" and his side had lacked the rhythm that helped them humble Bayern and virtually assure their place in the Champions League last four ahead of Tuesday's second leg in Munich. ""But these are the kind of wins that are really important,"" the former Spain and Barca midfielder told a news conference. ""There are eight matches left and we are one step closer."" Messi suffered a rare failure from the penalty spot in the 81st minute when Riesgo saved the Argentine's low effort after Jose Manuel Casado had handled a Daniel Alves cross. Villarreal, in fourth, missed a chance to cut the nine-point gap to Sevilla when they lost 2-0 at home to Malaga later on Saturday, a third defeat in four domestic matches for the Champions League quarter-finalists. Goalkeeper Diego Lopez got a hand to Duda's 38th-minute strike but the ball bounced in off the right-hand post to give the visitors the lead. Eliseu made sure of the points when he finished off a swift break with around five minutes left and Malaga moved into sixth above Atletico Madrid and Deportivo Coruna, who play each other in Sunday's late match. Valencia can claim the fourth Champions League spot from Villarreal with a win at Sporting Gijon on Sun"

Madonna, who lost an appeal against a High Court decision refusing her bid to adopt a four-year-old girl named Mercy James, said she wants to provide education and a family environment for the young girl. ""I want to provide Mercy with a home, a loving family environment and the best education and healthcare possible. And it's my hope that she like David, will one day return to Malawi and help the people of their country,"" Madonna told the Nation on Sunday newspaper in an emailed response to questions. ""Though I have been advised that I cannot publicly discuss the pending appeal regarding my desire to adopt Mercy, I do want to say how much I appreciate the level of support that I have received from the people of Malawi and my friends around the world."" Malawi's government came under fire after Madonna adopted a 13-month-old child, David Banda, in 2006, with critics accusing it of giving her special treatment by skirting laws that ban non-residents from adopting children. Madonna's lawyer, Alan Chinula, has already lodged a notice of appeal against the decision earlier this month but by last week the courts had not yet granted a date for the hearing. In her ruling, Judge Esimie Chombo warned against celebrity adoptions, saying they could lead to child trafficking. ""Anyone could come to Malawi and quickly arrange for an adoption that might have grave consequences on the very children that the law seeks to protect,"" she said. Madonna has entertained millions around the world with sexy high-energy performances and songs like ""Material Girl"" and ""Papa Don't Preach,"" and created controversies along the way. The star, who was divorced last year from British film director Guy Ritchie, is one of the music industry's most successful singers, with album sales of more than 200 mil"

The ACC was asked to appear with all procedural documents of the commission since its inception, along with its latest annual and audit reports. Former ACC secretary Hossain, now land secretary, refused the summons in writing. ""As the Anticorruption Commission is an independent institution, it is not proper to summon me as its secretary,"" Delwar told reporters last week. Former ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud also reportedly refused in writing, but made no public statement. Meanwhile, commissioner and present acting chairman Habibur Rahman told reporters last Thursday: ""We have decided not to attend the standing committee meeting. This decision has been intimated to them."" ""They believe they have the legal authority to summon the commission. We disagree,"" said the acting ACC chief. ""The ACC is accountable only to the president for its activities. Besides, the name of the ACC is not included in the list of government organisations [under the committee's purview]."" The government appointed Habibur Rahman acting ACC chief on Apr 7 after former chairman Hasan Mashhud quit his office at the start of the month."
